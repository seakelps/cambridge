In\naddition to better serving trips to Boston that pass through Cambridge, the\nGLX will serve trips from these locations into the key employment centers\nlocated in eastern Cambridge.\n\n\u00b7 Assisting in meeting the City\u2019s and the region\u2019s mobility, sustainability,\nand economic development goals.  \n\nTo date, the GLX project has made significant progress on construction,\nincluding relocation of the adjacent commuter rail tracks to make room for the\nlight rail line, construction of sound walls and other structures, replacement\nof bridges along the alignment, and beginning construction of a new vehicle\nmaintenance building. More noticeable work has recently begun in Cambridge in\nthe vicinity of Lechmere, including significant progress on the construction\nof the viaduct for the new Lechmere Station and the connection north and west\ntowards Somerville and Medford. In May 2020, service to the current Lechmere\nStation will shut down and be replaced with a major busing operation to\nconnect to downtown Boston, allowing for the reconstruction and renovation of\nthe existing Lechmere viaduct and the tie-in to the new Lechmere Station. The\nfirst phase of the GLX is then expected to open approximately a year later, in\nthe late spring of 2021.  \n  \nCity staff continue to be heavily involved in reviewing and commenting on the\ndesign of the improvements within Cambridge, as well as the impacts on City\nstreets and utilities. This includes attending monthly Community Working Group\nmeetings, reviewing preliminary designs and construction documents,\ncoordinating utility design and construction, and assisting in publicizing\nupcoming construction work and the resulting impacts.  \n  \nBased on the most recent information provided by the MBTA\u2019s Green Line\nExtension program management, the GLX project continues to advance on time and\non budget. This is particularly important as the project reaches important\nmilestones on heavy infrastructure work such as major drainage elements,\nbridges and viaducts, and the vehicle maintenance building. Based on the\nprogress to date, the project continues to meet the requirements laid out in\nthe Project Participation Agreement (PPA) between the City of Cambridge, the\nMBTA, and the Massachusetts Department of Transportation. As a result, I\nremain confident that the funds being contributed to the GLX project are being\nspent responsibly and for the purposes laid out in the PPA, and I am pleased\nto request this appropriation to continue our partnership with the state and\nthe MBTA.\n\n"

These funds are used to help tenants avoid eviction by\npaying a portion of back rent or by helping tenants who are moving to new\nhousing pay for a security deposit and/or moving expenses.

Tenants will also be able to request to request assistance 3 times\nin 5 years rather than 2 times. The current housing challenges make this\nincrease in funding very useful.  \n  \nThis appropriation request is also in response to Awaiting Reports Numbers\n19-90 and 19-99.\n\n"

            "aceladescription": "Listed below are the recommendations of the Community Preservation Act\nCommittee (CPAC) for FY2020. For additional information, please see\nattachments from the CPA Committee Chair, Lisa Peterson, dated September 18,\n2019.  \n  \nThe CPA process included a public hearing held on June 20, 2019 to solicit\nproposals and ideas on CPA projects for FY2020. A second public hearing was\nheld on July 31, 2019 to solicit recommendations on the percentage of CPA\nfunds allocated to each funding category: Affordable Housing, Historic\nPreservation, and Open Space. The CPAC also received several petitions,\nletters, online submissions and e-mails regarding potential CPA projects and\nthe allocation percentages. The CPAC, on September 17, 2019, unanimously voted\nfor an allocation of 80% for Affordable Housing, 10% for Historic Preservation\nprojects and 10% for Open Space projects.  \n  \nIn accordance with the CPAC\u2019s recommendations, I am requesting that the City\nCouncil appropriate a total of $13,230,000 in CPA funds raised by the City's\nFY2020 CPA surcharge, the FY2019 state match funds received in FY2020 and a\nportion of the existing CPA fund balance.  \n  \nFor this appropriation, it is estimated that the net local receipts from the\nCPA surcharge for FY2020 will total $9,900,000, added to an anticipated FY2019\nstate match of $1,220,000 and an additional $2,100,000 from CPA Fund Balance.\nAdditionally, $10,000 from CPA Fund Balance will go to the City\u2019s annual\nmembership in the Community Preservation Coalition.  \n  \nOn September 17, 2019, the CPAC made recommendations for allocation of these\nFY2020 funds.

The recent zoning ordinance passed on December 17, 2018 by the\nCouncil provided at \u00a711.806 that the zoning for cannabis businesses would take\neffect on April 20, 2019 \u201cor upon passage of a \u2018Cannabis Business Permitting\nOrdinance,\u2019 whichever comes first.\u201d After the Cannabis Business Permitting\nOrdinance is enacted, actions required by the City Council relating to\ncannabis businesses in the City would be completed.  \n  \nThis draft Ordinance creates an independent permitting process that all\ncannabis businesses in the City will be required to satisfy as a condition to\noperating in Cambridge. The Ordinance applies to Cannabis Retail Stores,\nCannabis Cultivators, Cannabis Product Manufacturers and Cannabis\nTransporters. The Ordinance creates an initial two-year period of exclusivity\nallowing only Priority Applicants, as defined in the Ordinance, to obtain a\nCannabis Business Permit in the City. After the two years, other applicants\nmay also be granted Cannabis Business Permits. Group A Priority Applicants are\ndefined in the Ordinance as those certified by the Commonwealth as Economic\nEmpowerment or Social Equity Program applicants, or a Women or Minority Owned\nbusiness. Group B Priority Applicants are existing Registered Marijuana\nDispensaries (\u201cRMDs\u201d) selling medical cannabis who also want to sell retail\ncannabis. All applicants must satisfy the ten permitting requirements listed\nin section 5 of the Ordinance.  \n  \nThe permitting process will be primarily administered and enforced by the\nInspectional Services Department. However, the Community Development\nDepartment, Public Health Department and the Police Department will also have\na role to play in the administration and enforcement of the Ordinance\nprovisions. In brief, the Ordinance proposes the following steps in the\noverall City permitting process for Cannabis Businesses:  \n\na. Priority Applicants to request certification as such by the Director of the\nEconomic Development Division of the Community Development Department;\n\nb. All applicants to enter into a Host Community Agreement with the City to be\nexecuted by the City Manager and the applicant;\n\nc. All applicants to apply for and obtain a Planning Board special permit in\ncompliance with the Zoning Ordinance;\n\nd. All applicants to obtain all other permits and approval required by State\nand local laws and regulations to the extent that such other permits and\napprovals can be obtained prior to the City\u2019s issuance of the Cannabis\nBusiness Permit; and\n\ne. All applicants to obtain the Cannabis Business Permit from the Inspectional\nServices Department provided for by the attached Ordinance.  \n\nThe Cannabis Business Permit will be subject to annual renewal and will be\nsubject to revocation if the holder violates the applicable laws and/or permit\nconditions. Both ISD and CDD will have authority to promulgate regulations to\nimplement the Ordinance with respect to their respective Ordinance\nresponsibilities.  \n  \nThis Ordinance has been informed by discussions that have taken place over the\npast several months at the City Council and its Public Safety Committee,\nNeighborhood and Long-Term Planning Committee, and Economic Development and\nUniversity Relations Committee. This draft was prepared with the participation\nof several departments, including the Law Department, Community Development\nDepartment, Public Health Department, Inspectional Services Department, Police\nDepartment, Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department, Department of\nHuman Services Programs and License Commission.\n\n"

He\nstated that this is a petition that is being jointly filed by the owners of\ntwo parcels that are contained in the proposed New Street Overlay District.\nThis is a refiled petition and the original petition did not advance beyond\nthe Ordinance committee. He stated that with lessons learned from the original\npetition and feedback received, the property owner went back and analyzed the\nentire program. He noted that the overriding message that was heard from the\nlast presentation was the need to create more of an active and mixed-use\nenvironment on New Street. He explained that the prior proposal allowed for an\nincrease in density and height for this newly created use. The petition\ncreates a new category of storage. He stated that the current storage is\ntreated with no distinction in the table of uses between a warehouse that\nwould accommodate all types of truck traffic and uses typically associated\nwith storage warehouses, versus self-storage which is a consumer-oriented\nestablishment. He stated that the representatives from SSG can tell more about\nself-storage which has a number of benefits and attributes that are\nstabilizing forces in residential communities. He stated that this is the goal\nsought by the proponents that believe that this location will benefit greatly\nfrom the type of business that they provide.\n\nFrom a zoning perspective Rafferty said there are three changes to the\npetition that are noteworthy. He stated that the first change is the criteria\nthat would be imposed on any application for a special permit to allow for\nadditional height and would not include a requirement affordable housing. He\nnoted that there was no housing proposed in the prior petition. He continued\nthat the petition in its current form in Section 20.95.1 (1) The first\ncriteria talks about a minimum of 8,000 square feet of affordable housing. The\nproponents have modified and will show a plan to include 20,000 square feet of\naffordable housing and petitioners are pleased to report that they have\nentered a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Just-A-Start (JAS). Attorney\nRafferty announced that Mr. Nicholson from JAS is here to discuss this joint\nventure agreement that they intend to pursue where JAS experience, expertise\nand knowledge in affordable housing will be put to good use here. He stated\nthat JAS will own and control this affordable housing. He added that the\ndesign of the housing has become a critical aspect of mitigating the impact of\nthe building. The architect will demonstrate how the housing use at this site\ncan be compatible and can serve as a softening of the building edge as it\napproaches the street.\n\nHe stated that the other notable amendment that would be sought by the\napplicant would involve the height dimension. This is in Section 20.96 and the\nlanguage of the petition states that the maximum height for the petition could\nbe 65 feet. They are proposing an amendment that there would be a bulk plane\nrequirement, a requirement that exists in many zonings and overlay districts\nin the City. He explained that at the 55-foot height the building on all four\nsides will have to step back at a 45-degree angle from 55 to 65 feet. He\nstated that this has the effect of reducing the mass of the building both as\nthe building is seen on New Street and from Danehy Park. He noted that these\nare the two substantive changes.\n\nRafferty stated that the third component of petition that there is an area of\n2,500 square feet devoted to retail use. He noted that the intention is for\nthe Evolve Gym to have a facility. He stated that Mr. Bachrach can go through\nthe details of the arrangements. The Evolve Gym is now a tenant at will and\ntheir lease expired at the end of December 2018 and the owner of the building\nis fully intent on selling the building. He noted that it has been a case that\nthe Evolve Gym\u2019s long-term use at the site is very limited. He explained that\nan arrangement has been made that the proponents will build out a space for\nEvolve at a size that will work for the gym, although it is a different size.\nHe stated that the size was the subject of negotiations with Evolve and the\nrental rate for the space will be a below market rate in an effort to keep\nthis component an active use in the building. The hope is that Evolve will\nremain for a long time. The scaling back of the proposed height and the\nintroduction of the gym are two of the changes.\n\nRafferty stated that the Planning Board\u2019s presentation did not include the\nbulk plane restrictions nor the increase in the amount of affordable housing.\nHe noted that there are components of the petition that are very different\nthan what the Planning Board evaluated.\n\nHe stated that Mr. Boyes-Watson will present some visual elements of this\npresentation that would turn the text of the petition into an understanding of\nwhat can be built at the site. He commented that it has been an effective\ncollaboration with Mr. Boyes-Watson and JAS on how to optimize housing at this\nlocation, creating the type of unit size that would be most affected. He spoke\nabout the obvious adjacency to a large recreational facility, walking distance\nto an elementary school makes this a very attractive housing location for\nfamilies and the fact that there are residential uses emerging on the other\nside of New Street. He addressed the comment about why the overlay district\nonly encompasses one side of the street. He responded that this is a function\nof reality. The other side of the street has an existing residential building\nalready underway and it did not make sense to include those parcels in the\noverlay district because it was unlikely to see much change in those\nbuildings. He stated that the other element of the petition that is new to the\npetition addresses a consistent theme with the Envision Planning in the\nAlewife Area. He stated that the idea to find locations in emerging mixed-use\ndistricts within Alewife where additional housing could be permitted. He\nstated that the petition does contain language that Mr. Markarian (owner of\nadjacent site) or his successor to be motivated to convert the automotive and\nthe light industrial uses to housing. This is to incentivize housing on this\nside of New Street. He stated that regarding the site presentation there is an\nopportunity to make the connection on land owned by the petitioner to the back\nend of Danehy Park. At this time Mr. Boyes-Watson gave his presentation.\n\nMark Boyes-Watson, architect, spoke about the overarching urban design of the\noverlay by viewing slides, including existing conditions and some of the\nproposed streetscape design, to see if New Street can with the change in\nzoning become what it seems to want to become, which is more of a housing\nstreet and less a street of a strange mixture of uses that it is today. He\nstated that with the changes New Street can become a mixture of housing. He\ngave a presentation (ATTACHMENT B) of the overall building that incorporates\nhousing along New Street, which is accessible on the ground floor. One of the\nslides begins to show the relationship is of the housing to the storage\nbuilding. He stated that there is a planted setback on the New Street level\nbefore Danehy Park rises. The building is raised out of the ground because it\nis in a flood zone. He spoke about the bulk plane setting the top story back\nand it is more than a 45-degree bulk control plane on New Street. He stated\nthat the top floor of the storage building starts 40 feet back and the public\nwill not be aware of the upper top story when on New Street.\n\nHe stated that the parking is concealed inside the building. This parking is\nalso for the housing and gym. He noted that the storage space is a low traffic\ngeneration and does not require parking; it is used intermittently and there\nis a modest loading zone. The gym has windows that look out onto Danehy Park.\n\nThere is a proposed bike and pedestrian pathway. Watson spoke about a storage\nfacility for sports equipment because there is a shortage of storage at Danehy\nPark. This is accessed off the pedestrian pathway. He stated that the housing\nis used as the primary street frontage for New Street. He stated that the\nstorage facility has a green wall design and a gallery of windows overlooking\nDanehy Park and the upper setback story of the storage facility is setback 45\nfeet. He stated that additional plant material will be introduced on the site.\nHe stated that there are existing trees along the border and on the park edge.\nHe stated that a robust row of trees will be planted down the property line.\nHe explained that the intention of this building is to get to Net Zero and the\nstorage area is energy efficient. He stated that combining the large roof and\nthe well-designed envelope it is expected that this building can be both the\nequivalent of LEED Gold and Net Zero.\n\nThe proposed building is creating a more consistent urban form down this side\nof New Street as is the HRI building (now under construction) that overlooks\nFresh Pond. He stated that the creation of these units of affordable housing\nis an appropriate urban design response to this location. He spoke about the\ntraffic at the site. He stated that the self-storage use is one of the lowest\ntraffic generators. He stated that the 2070 compliance is for the flood and\nstorm water requirements and currently the site tends to flood but a storage\ninfiltration system can be designed that sits under the parking level to deal\nwith this. The site can be designed to mitigate environmental conditions and\nthis is a great advantage.\n\nCraig Nicholson, JAS, stated that JAS was approached by SSG to work with them\non the affordable housing component for this site. JAS entered into a MOU and\nupon this project going forward JAS would be in a position to take over the\nhousing component, own it, keep it permanently affordable, manage it and\nmaintain it in the same fashion as JAS does for the rest of its portfolio. He\ncommented that the inclusion of affordable housing in the project is a\ncreative way to take something that could just become a commercial component\nand have some inclusionary money sent into the trust fund. Hopefully it would\nget used in the right place and right time, but put it into a situation where\nhousing definitely gets built and by having it be a mixed used building where\nthe entire front of the building is housing there is no possibility that there\nwill be only a storage structure without housing up front. This is unique and\na way to ideally and ultimately create affordable housing at less cost than if\nit were an open market transaction. He added that JAS is excited to partner\nwith SSG on this.\n\nHe stated that a 20,000 square foot building would yield approximately 20\nunits, but in this scenario, we are looking for less than 20 units because the\ngoal is predominantly family size units. He outlined the units as 20% of the\nunits would be 3-bedroom units and 60% of the units would be 2-bedroom units\nand on the affordability level would be looking for more of a moderate\naffordability at 80%. He spoke about the typical family size that occupies a\n1, 2- or 3-bedroom units, which would bring families into this neighborhood\nnext to Danehy Park with the moderate affordability at the 80% AMI. This is\nvery difficult to achieve in Cambridge. He stated that a lot of the programs\nfor new construction for affordable housing requires tax credits, which puts\nthis tier significantly lower and creates a gap in the middle. He noted that\nthis unique situation where housing can be created without the same overly\nheavily subsidized tax credit type of approach creates a moderate tier for\nideally working families within Cambridge is something that JAS is excited to\nbe a part of.\n\nMr. Bachrach stated that he is proud of the work being done with JAS and the\nefforts to accommodate the gym. He stated that much was learned at the\nPlanning Board hearing which did not go well and as a result significant\nchanges were made to the design to reduce the height, allow setbacks so that\nyou are looking at four-story building from the front of the building. He\nstated that the self-storage business is nothing more than a neighborhood\ncloset. He stated that 75% of customers are residential and 25% of customers\nare small businesses and all from the immediate neighborhood. He stated that\nthis industry helps to stabilize neighborhoods. He spoke about small\nbusinesses that run out of storage space and cannot afford to rent larger\nspace at $30 a square foot in Cambridge so they come to the storage space at\n$2 a square foot to off-load their back-office inventory or record keeping and\nare able to stay in the neighborhood. He cited other examples where storage\nspace is needed. He stated that this is a local amenity with low traffic and\nuses less water than a single-family home.\n\nHe stated that in terms of the public benefits if approved the project would\nprovide storage space for families in transition who are at risk of losing\ntheir possessions, storage space for athletic equipment used at Danehy Park\nand the pedestrian and bike path along the Danehy Park side of the building.\nHe stated that he is proud of the proposed rooftop solar field, which will the\nlargest private solar field in the City. He stated that he hopes to do more as\ntime goes by with more community input into this process which is only at the\nearly stage. He expects to get more input if given the opportunity to proceed.\n\nCouncillor Carlone asked if there are any clarifying questions.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan stated that storage does not require parking, just the\nloading. He asked if all the parking is for the housing and the gym. Mr.\nWilliams stated that the storage does need a little parking. He added that\nmost of the activity happens in the loading area. He stated that when a\ncustomer comes to a storage facility they park, go into the office and arrange\nfor a contract and when they go to use the storage facility by either taking\npossessions in or out of the storage unit they park in the loading area and go\nin and out; there is a low parking need for this type of building. Councillor\nZondervan asked could there be less parking. Mr. Williams said this parking\nwill support the housing, the gym and the storage. He stated that there is an\nallowance of 5-7 spaces for the gym and 7-8 spaces for the 15 units of housing\nfor a total of 20 parking spaces in the parking field.\n\nAttorney Rafferty said the petition proposes that the parking requirement for\ndwelling units be reduced from the current l in the district to .75 so the\nresidential parking is being scaled back. He explained that Mr. Nicholson has\nstated throughout his portfolio there are many households without cars.\nCouncillor Zondervan commented that he is in favor of reducing this to zero.\nHe asked if this can be constructed in such a way that the parking can be\nreclaimed in the future if it is determined that the parking is not needed.\nMr. Williams responded in the affirmative.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan asked if there is another floor above and referenced\nslide 7. Mr. Williams stated that this is showing a typical upper floor. This\nfloor plan would be for floors 2, 3 and 4 of the housing and storage. The\nfifth-floor storage would be a smaller footprint because it is set back.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan stated that on slide 9 he questioned LEED Gold and Net\nZero and stated that this felt tentative. Mr. Boyes-Watson spoke of the design\nbeing changed and the roof shrinking. He noted that the housing does use more\nenergy than the storage facility. He stated that he was trying not to over\npromise. Mr. Williams stated that on the original design from last year\ncalculations were done and they were able to get the storage building at the\nNet Zero classification. He noted that the design has evolved with input and\nthe roof for the self-storage has shrunk with the inclusion of the housing. He\nstated that all the calculations have not been finished with the modified\ndesign. He stated that he felt confident that they can get a large solar field\non the fourth floor of the roof and parts of the fifth floor of the roof and\nthe housing has not been analyzed to see how a component could work with this.\nHe stated that this goal is important to the petitioners. Mr. Nicholson stated\nthat JAS tries to make all their buildings energy efficient for lower long-\nterm maintenance. Lower operating costs are critical to maintain reduced rents\nso a highly efficient envelope, lower energy consumption and LEED is what is\nbeing strived for. He stated that JAS will make this as efficient as possible\nand get to Net Zero and LEED Gold. Councillor Zondervan suggested considering\nmaking it Net Zero Ready because Net Zero is not a design standard. Net Zero\ncannot be verified until it is operating but if it is made Net Zero Ready will\nenable getting to Net Zero practice.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan spoke about slide 11 and wanted more detail on what is\nenvisioned for the multi-use path and what will it be used for; how wide it is\nand is it just a bike path or is it truly a multi-use path. Mr. Boyes-Watson\nstated that it is a five-foot path by the side of the building. There is a\nwide unused berm, which is part of the Danehy Park design. What is being shown\non the slide is that the berm will be an amenity; the petition will provide a\nfive-foot pathway. He stated that there is a bigger opportunity here that is\nbeyond the scope of this overlay and as a landscape architect he would be\nthinking creatively whether there can be more uses for the berm. Councillor\nZondervan commented that five feet is not enough and wanted more work on this\naspect.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan moved to slide 12. He asked if the stormwater can be\ncaptured and reused the same way as is done on the King School on Putnam\nAvenue. Mr. Boyes-Watson responded in the affirmative. He spoke about\nirrigation requirements and would definitely look toward doing this.\nCouncillor Zondervan stated that on slide 14 regarding the parking, he noted\nthat there were concerns raised at the Planning Board about making sure that\nthe parking is secure for the affordable housing tenants. Mr. Boyes-Watson\nstated that there is nothing about the way the parking is designed that would\nnot allow some type of gated access as long as it is compatible and further\nstated that because this is a mixed-use building accessibility is needed for\nthe users of the gym and housing. Mr. Williams stated that one of the\ncomponents of the self-storage business is secure and there are sixteen\nsecurity cameras on site constantly surveilling; there is a record of all who\nenters or exists the site. Councillor Zondervan suggested a garage door that\nclosed at midnight and some type of gated access. Mr. Nicholson stated that\nthere is no gated parking at any JAS sites; there are security cameras; proper\nlighting and make it inhospitable for anyone to lurk.\n\nCouncillor Mallon asked for clarification on the AMI. She asked is it a\nminimum of 80% AMI for all the units. Mr. Nicholson responded that it is the\nmaximum. Councillor Mallon asked did JAS look at this parcel when it was\navailable for sale for affordable housing. Mr. Nicholson responded in the\naffirmative, but it was under agreement with SSG. He stated that an initial\ncursory look was done on the property. He stated that obviously with the full\nsite there would be more affordable housing but would have to be fully born by\nthe subsidies and rents by the housing. He stated that the request for the\nCity and Affordable Housing Trust would have been more on a per unit basis\nthan in a situation like this. He stated that regarding the timing it would\ntake several years to get underway and to break ground. He stated that based\non the scarcity of resources and process that needs to be undertaken with the\nstate to get these resources granted to a project. Councillor Mallon commented\nthat there is sentiment to have the whole site for affordable housing.\n\nShe asked if the traffic generation is the same as last year and will there be\nmore traffic with the 15 units of housing. Mr. Williams responded that the\ntraffic study has not been updated with the plan redesign. Councillor Mallon\nasked if the art mural wall was lost, which was on the original proposal. Mr.\nBachrach stated that he is open to have an art wall and will be happy to work\nwith the Arts Council. Councillor Mallon wanted the benefits for sports\nstorage and family in transitions and asked why this is not listed on the\npublic benefits. Mr. Bachrach stated that the focus is on the overlay\ndistrict. He stated that he is committed to the public benefits as listed in\nthe past and including the art wall, storage for sport facilities and families\nin transition. He proposed a green wall and if this petition goes forward this\nwill be left up to the City on whether it wants a green wall or an art wall.\nAttorney Rafferty stated that in the petition in section 20.95.1 spells out\nthe criteria for the Planning Board to evaluate an application for a special\npermit. He noted that # 2 is public benefits that will enhance the use of the\nadjoining Danehy Park. This was a way to capture this concept without\nspecifically doing so. He stated that this could be subject to amendment. He\nstated that specifically number 4 goes to the provisions for affordable short-\nterm storage. He commented that this has not fallen out of the petition. This\nwas in the prior petition and is in this petition explicitly as criteria\nnecessary to grant a special permit.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux asked what the total GFA is of this building that is\navailable under the zoning. She noted that this is a substantial up zoning.\nMr. Boyes-Watson stated that the components of project as drawn is just over\n110,000 square feet of storage; 20,000 square feet of housing and 2,500 square\nfoot for the gym. He stated that the parking for the housing is exempt but\nbecause of the flood plain all the housing would be exempt. Vice Mayor\nDevereux asked if the vision of the zoning goes lot line to lot line. Mr.\nBoyes-Watson stated that the building has setbacks on all sides. He stated\nthat the illustrations show a building setback 5 feet everywhere with 10 feet\non New Street in addition to the other bulk plane controls. Vice Mayor\nDevereux commented on a discrepancy that she sees in terms of this area\ndescribed as unused park land along Danehy Park side shown on slide five. She\nstated that what is shown is a grassy lawn with some trees, but this is fenced\noff because it is a methane trench and it not open to the public. Mr. Watson\nstated that where the line of trees along the path is about 2 feet from the\nproperty line. Vice Mayor Devereux repeated that the other area does not\nexist; it is a methane trench and is fenced off for health and environment\nreasons. This path is not a realistic benefit unless the petitioner is going\nto give more of his land to create a desirable path. Attorney Rafferty stated\nthat the path and its location was provided to the petitioners by the Envision\nStudy. He stated that the location of the path in that area and image in the\npresentation shows the path was not a creation of the petitioners. He noted\nthat this is the desired connection from the Envision Study. Vice Mayor\nDevereux stated that the path needs to be created on the land of this site\nbecause the public land is not available for a path. Gym windows will be\nlooking at an embankment of the park and will not be looking at Danehy Park.\n\nCouncillor Kelley stated that this is a big ask for both height and FAR beyond\nwhat is allowed in current zoning. Attorney Rafferty stated that the current\nFAR would yield a building one-half the size of the proposed storage building.\nHe stated that the petition is looking to increase the FAR to 3.0 and the\ncurrent FAR is 1.25. This would not allow the 20,000 square feet of housing,\nwhich over and above the increased FAR permitted for the commercial building.\nThis is 20,000 on housing side and on the storage side the square footage\nincrease. Mr. Boyes-Watson stated that this calculation has not been done\nbecause there would be a bonus for the affordable component. He stated that if\nthe site is 43,000 square feet the increase in GFA is worth 50,000. Councillor\nKelley noted that this is a big thing for this area.\n\nCouncillor Siddiqui asked why they chose 15 housing units and if they had\nsimilar joint venture partnership in the portfolio before. Mr. Nicholson\nlooked at joint ventures for developments but nothing as concrete as this\nproposal. He stated SSG decided to increase the housing and the 15 units is a\nfactor in increasing the number for family sized units. Councillor Siddiqui\nasked if there is a mixed-used self-storage. Mr. Bacharach responded that he\nunaware of any-mixed use storage has been done anywhere in the country. He\nstated that he has done projects that included other uses. He spoke about a\ncurrent project in Jamaica Plains where the City asked to have built a housing\ncomplex adjacent to the storage building he is building. A common parking lot\nis shared.\n\nCouncillor Carlone asked what the GFA storage size is. Mr. Boyes-Watson said\n110,000 square feet. Councillor Carlone asked Mr. Nicholson about the\nstatement that this is an unusual deal from an affordable housing perspective.\nHe asked what the deal is. He asked if JAS is seeking funds to compliment what\nis being offered. Mr. Nicholson stated that JAS would act as a development\nconsultant during the process and upon completion of the units JAS would\npurchase the units as a turnkey situation. He stated that JAS investment is\ntime and a lump sum purchase of a finished project. He stated that in terms of\ncost he does not have the numbers and cannot say what levels of funding will\nbe needed. The funding will involve a standard mortgage which the property\nwould pay. He spoke about state subsidies that would be applied for. He stated\nthat depending on the final numbers and through the City through the\nAffordable Housing Trust acted as a gap filler for this type of thing. He\nadded in this scenario he does not know what the gap would be. Councillor\nCarlone stated that new unit locations could cost $100,000 - $200,000 per unit\nfor the land and is there a benefit other than turnkey on a financial basis or\na land value. Mr. Nicholson responded that a land value is being discussed but\nwas not negotiated yet. The land value is significantly less than $100,000 -\n$200,000 per unit. Councillor Carlone noted that there needs to be a financial\ninvestment from both sides.\n\nCouncillor Carlone asked Mr. Roberts to come forward and discuss the Planning\nBoard\u2019s comments.\n\nMr. Roberts stated that the Planning Board heard the current petition on June\n4, 2019 and the original petition was not heard by the Planning Board last\nyear due to scheduling complications. The Planning Board voted not to\nrecommend the petition. He explained that the Planning Board had no concern\nwith the self-storage as a use but had concerns conceptually. He stated that\nthe Planning Board was receptive to some of the petitioner\u2019s descriptions of\nhow this kind of use can work in a complimentary fashion to residential uses.\nHe stated that the concerns of the Planning Board were with the notion of\nwhether there should be such different treatment for self-storage uses on this\nparticular site, rather than having criteria and standards for self-storage\nuses in all similarly zone districts of the City.\n\nHe stated that another Planning Board concern for this particular overlay\ndistrict was about the overall commercial development scale that was being\nproposed and the impact it would have in an area that has begun to transition\nsignificantly from commercial to residential character. He stated that the\nPlanning Board did hear the proposal with the additional affordable housing\nunits and felt that this was an improvement to the proposal and going in the\nright direction. He noted that the petitioners did not assess the bulk control\nplane that was introduced in the interim but ultimately the Planning Board\nstill felt that there were concerns about the overall scale in relation to\nsurrounding areas such as the adjacent residential sites and Danehy Park and\nthe impact.\n\nHe stated that from a site-specific point of view there were more concerns\nabout project review concerning the path proposed along the side. The Planning\nBoard wondered what the character and feel of the path would be considering it\nis in a low point of the park and the proposed self-storage use generating\nminimum activation in this area. Mr. Roberts noted that the Planning Board\nappreciated the suggestions in the petition about retail space on the ground\nfloor would help to serve the continuation of the gym use on the site and that\nthe adjacent site where this building is proposed could in the future be\ndeveloped into housing in a way that will help to further visually screen the\nstorage site but given the uncertainty of retail tenancy on a long-term basis\nas well as the uncertainty about what could actually happen on the adjacent\nsite the Planning Board felt that it was hard to come to a conclusion based on\nthese factors. He stated that this was the overall impression of the Planning\nBoard.\n\nHe added that some Planning Board members noted that if this were to move\nforward that there are provisions in the language that the Planning Board\nsuggested should be reviewed more carefully to make sure that the expectation\nand criteria are clear and consistent with other parts of the zoning ordinance\nwhich is recommended for any zoning proposal.\n\nCouncillor Mallon asked about the Planning Board\u2019s concerns about the path and\nthe low activation and asked if the board felt that this would be unsafe. Mr.\nRoberts stated that this was part of the concern. He stated that the overall\nimpression of the pathway that on one side would have a building with a self-\nstorage use with no windows, except on the residential side, and would have\nuses with no windows looking down onto the path and then on the other side is\nthe methane trench with the hill going up to the taller part of Danehy Park\nmay feel like a closed off space. Ultimately it may be a space where\nindividuals would feel uncomfortable being there.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux stated that the Planning Board unanimously voted not to\nforward this petition with an unfavorable recommendation. She stated that Ted\nCohen felt it was close to spot zoning without any good planning rationale.\nMr. Cohen noted that the environmental features are things that are currently\nrequired or will be soon. She added that Steve Cohen wondered why when the\nCity is trying to incentivize housing, when it is already the emerging use and\nnoted in Envision, why go in the other direction to up zone for a non-\nresidential use. She stated that the City Council is being asked to change the\nzoning but this seems like it is going in the wrong direction. She stated that\nMr. Bacci has questions related to security and how the storage would be used,\nand traffic was understated for the storage uses. She added that another\nPlanning Board member commented on the blank tall wall looming over Danehy\nPark and Mr. Russell noted that the 65 feet would be overwhelming on the\nsoccer field and had questions on the wording of the zoning petition. Vice\nMayor Devereux stated that the Chair of the Planning Board was uncomfortable\nwith the spot zoning and she felt that is one cannot tell if you are reviewing\na project or zoning this is not in a good place. Vice Mayor Devereux commented\nthat the City Council is not in a good place with this petition in terms of\nwhat it is trying to do from a planning standpoint.\n\nShe noted that the Planning Board is being asked repeatedly to approve up\nzoning and they commented at one of their meetings that the Board felt they\nwere getting out of planning because everything was being negotiated on a\nparcel by parcel basis with potential community benefits that were often\nsubject to letters of agreement or political negotiations in this City Council\nrather than with them. She stated that she is not comfortable doing planning\nthis way. She spoke about the other parcel and the co-petitioner is a larger\nparcel than this one and do not know what this zoning would do for this owner\nand his intentions to redevelop this parcel. She stated that if this was being\nzoned for self-storage at a greater density the City should not be unhappy if\nhe decides that a self-storage building is profitable and builds a large\nstorage building and throw in housing. This would result in a large portion of\nNew Street where it meets Bay State Road. She noted what has not been\nmentioned is that both lots back up onto Bay State Road that may one day want\nto be redeveloped but are not up zoned and currently some are residential at a\nlow scale. She added from a planning standpoint why would the City Council do\nthis and in particularly when the Planning Board has unanimously advised that\nthey would not.\n\nCouncillor Carlone noted that the scheme has changed somewhat but may not\nsatisfy issues such as the green wall and setback and windows at the top.\n\nCouncillor Kelley stated that he was confused with the establishment of the\nhousing here impacts what would normally be paid into the linkage fee or does\nit. Mr. Roberts stated that the incentive zoning requirement would apply to\ncommercial and non-residential uses above a certain size of development;\n35,000 square feet or more. The commercial component has a per square foot\ncontribution which goes to the Affordable Housing Trust and this is no\nprovision and would not translate into a payment for these particular units.\nHe noted that this would be a separate payment to the Affordable Housing Trust\nand would be under a separate agreement.\n\nCouncillor Carlone opened the hearing to public comment. No one signed up for\npublic comment.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan asked what the term lease is for the Evolve gym. Mr.\nWilliams stated that in the letter of intent with Evolve it is a 10-year term\nwith 2 five-year renewal options. Councillor Zondervan asked who is paying for\nhousing. Mr. Nicholson stated that the ultimate cost of housing will be\ndependent on the cost to build it. He stated that the price for the land is\nsignificantly reduced which is a benefit. He believed that the incentive\nzoning fee gets paid into the Affordable Housing Trust. He stated that as the\nAffordable Housing Trust is the typical gap filler for affordable housing\nprojects in Cambridge and construction costs are still high with the reduced\nland what this gap will be needs to be filled. He stated that his estimation\nis that it will be significantly less that the gap that needs to be filled in\na standard project. Councillor Zondervan asked what the land value\ncontribution is. Mr. Nicholson stated that no final conclusion has been\nreached. He stated that he would like to look at the overall costs and see\nwhat exactly it must be from his perspective to make it all work out and make\nit a true benefit to the City. Councillor Zondervan stated that it is\nimportant for the City Council to know this because the only reason to approve\nthis project is because it comes with affordable housing and if it did not the\nCity Council would not approve this. He added that it is important for the\nCity Council to understand this and what the City is getting. He added that if\nall that is happening here is that that affordable housing is being built\nunder normal circumstances then the only real housing contribution is the land\nvalue which sounds like it is a discount and not be full value of the land. He\nstated that he wanted to know what this is. Mr. Nicholson then stated that\nthis is more than a 50% discount on the land and considerably more.\n\nMr. Nicholson spoke about deals lost above the $200,000 per unit range. He\nstated that they have discussed a land price but if this continues to be\nlowered to make sure the deal works and provides the benefit that the\npetitioners are trying to commit to then the price of the land will continue\nto drop to ensure that the deal works. Councillor Zondervan noted that self-\nstorage is not an ideal use in this neighborhood. He commended the developer\nfor making sure that the gym can stay open. The partnership with JAS is\nsignificant; 15 units of affordable housing is significant. He added that more\nhousing could be built on this site if there was no storage. He spoke about\nthe other community benefits of the storage for transition families, sports\nstorage and net zero building particularly if it includes housing. He noted\nthat there is no true Net Zero housing in Cambridge yet. He stated that he\nunderstands and shares the concerns of the Planning Board because this is a\nmassive up zoning and is very concerning but the developer has gone above and\nbeyond and has set a high bar for the kind of up zoning that the City Council\nought to consider. He is ready to support the project but wanted 3 items\nclearly specified in the zoning or the commitment letter to include:\n\nThat the entire building should be built to a Net Zero Ready standard;\n\nRetail space to continue to be retail or some other community space; no banks\nand no additional storage in the space; and\n\nA 5 feet path is not wide enough and wanted assurances that this will be top\nnotch community path and that it would be a true benefit to the community.\n\nHe stated that other up zoning projects in the City provide little community\nbenefit to the City and are not providing affordable housing. He added that\nthis project is very different for these reasons.\n\nCouncillor Kelley stated that he shares Vice Mayor Devereux\u2019s concerns. He\nnoted that he does not know what is being negotiated at this point. He stated\nthat this is what the City Council seems to be doing a lot of. He shares the\nPlanning Board concerns on doing one offs on specific things on a regular\nbasis. He added Cambridge can buy and build its own sports storage for youth.\nHe stated that he felt that the City Council is negotiating too much little\nstuff. He stated that he is concerned about how this continuously goes.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux stated that the path is a huge distraction. She stated\nthat their land ends in the back yards of existing buildings on Bay State\nRoad. There is no benefit to a path going from a part of Danehy Park that is\nnot used and does not go anywhere; there is not connection that anyone is\nasking for and the security risks are real. She asked if the site has been\nevaluated under the proposed Affordable Housing Overlay by JAS. She stated\nthat there could be a bigger building that could be entirely housing under the\nAHO. This building could be 80 feet tall and have many units and could\ncontinue to have a 2,500 square foot active studio gym. She commented that the\ncurrent gym is 18,000 square feet and has child care and multi-class rooms.\nThe proposal is a workout space but to call it a gym is a misnomer. Evolve gym\nusers depending on the parking and this is not a transit friendly location; it\nis a car dominated area and reducing parking does not help this. She stated\nthat if this an attractive area for housing she asked why the City is settling\nfor 15 units of housing and the City is still contributing funds to this and\nis enabling this. She stated that the cost is too high on the rest of the\nplanning goals and the surrounding neighborhoods. She urged the owner to come\nup with a better housing proposal for this site that is next to the park and\nis family friendly and environmentally sustainable.\n\nCouncillor Mallon spoke about the Pizzuto family, the former owner, who went\nto the self-storage group because they wanted a low impact, low traffic for\nthis street. She noted that this is a major concern in this area about the\ntraffic in this area. She noted that this began with a low impact traffic\ngoal. She shared the Planning Board concerns about spot zoning, the parcel\nnext door and what happens with this. Councillor Mallon stated that asking JAS\nto build 100% affordable housing for this site was not feasible based on\ntiming and the finances needed. She stated that suggesting that this could be\nbuilding under AHO, which has not been passed yet and may not happen. She\ncommented that the land value is significant, and JAS has come before the City\nCouncil many times informing the City Council about how they were unable to\nbid on property because of the land price and the cost of building housing.\nThis offers an opportunity to build affordable housing quickly. She stated\nthat keeping Evolve, 15 units of affordable housing and low impact traffic on\na s street which is being built up with residential housing and having\ncommercial and residential on the same site that will keep the traffic low\nmakes this project appealing. She expressed her gratitude to the petitioners\nfor their work to make this project supportable. She stated that she is\nstruggling with this. She asked Mr. Nicholson if it is possible under the AHO\ncould this be 100% affordable housing in the future.\n\nMr. Nicholson stated that there could be a mechanism where that site becomes\nall housing but whether it would be all affordable housing or mixed income\nhousing similar to the HRI project on Concord Avenue is hard to say at this\npoint. He stated that the numbers were run 1.5 years ago, and they have not\nbeen run under the potential of the overlay zoning. He stated that this is an\nexpensive project. It would involve 9% and 4% tax credits as well as a\nsignificant subsidy from the state and the City. He explained that 9% credits\nare very competitive and may take 2-3 years for this to be approved. He added\nthat the process of entitling it under 40B involves a potential for various\nappeals and lawsuits associated with this because it would not be a by-right\ntype of building in terms of parking ratio and setbacks looking to maximize\nthe space. These are the difficult things that JAS does all the time, but it\nis not quick, and he cannot guarantee this, and it is not simple. This site\ncan be all housing but will likely not be all affordable housing.\n\nCouncillor Mallon noted that there would have to be 75 units to get the amount\nneeded for the incentive zoning. Vice Mayor Devereux stated that the HRI\nproject on Concord Avenue it was stated that it was 98 units of affordable\nhousing. Mr. Nicholson stated that there is mid-market component and there is\na market rate component. He stated that there is a middle market that is\noutside of the standard structure and he thought that there was a market rate\ncomponent. He explained how the 9% tax credits work. He stated that there is a\nsweet spot at about 45 units. Once above this the 9% tax credits are maxed out\nthat can be applied to the building. Then you start with the 4% tax credit\ntier and this is about 3.25% and this is one-third of all the tax credits\nbeyond this which means that this requires more subsidy. He explained that\nthis is offset by having higher rents that the tax credits allow. Councillor\nCarlone added of the 98 units, 10 units are middle-income units. Councillor\nMallon stated that the CDD\u2019s website states it is 98 units and all units will\nbe affordable.\n\nCouncillor Siddiqui asked what is the public purpose to provide this type of\nuse that has not been recognized. The petition has changed since June 4th and\nit does not feel as well thought out as it should or could be. She stated that\nto negotiate this way is difficult.\n\nCouncillor Carlone announced that the petitioners would like this to be moved\nforward because of a purchase and sale agreement.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that understanding the value of the affordable\nhousing investment by petitioner is key. He noted that having access to land\nis a good thing. He stated that he would rather the gym space be a Pre-\nKindergarten space, which is sorely lacking in Cambridge. He wanted this to be\na true public benefit and understand the value of affordable housing\ninvestment. The impact of the project has been minimized by the design of\nproject and the programming. He agreed that there are issues with the path,\nbut the path was what Envision put on the site knowing that the methane was on\nthis site. He stated that taking out the path will add more green. He stated\nthat architecturally there are things that could minimize the massing. The set\nback on the roof with the top floor instead of being vertical could be treated\nlike a roof on an angle so that the bulk plane is actually a metal roof\ninstead of a metal facade which would make the appearance feel less\noverwhelming. He stated that most people would experience this from the soccer\nfield which would reduce the overall building to about 30 feet. He commented\nthat the solution from the street is good. The value of affordable housing\ninvestment has to be known for him to fully understand. He applauded the\neffort on the petition by the petitioners.\n\nMr. Nicholson spoke about the value of affordable housing. The land price is\nin the area of $50,000 per unit; this is a significant discount. He spoke\nabout how the construction costs would be dealt with. He noted that the\nfoundation, parking, and the podium that\u2019s the housing will be sitting on will\nbe done by developer and there remove those costs. Only the stick-built\ncomponent of the actual unit is what JAS would be buying. He stated that this\nis $2.5-$3 million of benefit and reduced cost for the affordable housing. He\nspoke about not having to do site work, podium, steel construction on this\nlevel is a significant discount on a per square foot price from overall\nconstruction. Councillor Carlone stated that this information needs to be\nformalized.\n\nCouncillor Kelley stated that he would feel better if someone with more\nknowledge about housing construction and affordable housing policy come to the\nCity Council and state that this is a good deal. He commented that the\nproponents are good people and are proposing to do something that will be a\nbig deal for them and it may be a great deal for the City of Cambridge. He\nstated that if we are going to do this we should be up front about the fact\nthat whatever is done is a negotiating process. He stated that the zoning\nshould not stay as it was written decades ago especially in a world that is\nevolving fast. He resents making judgments based on the money being saved per\nunit given the cost of the site and adding to this confusion about the\nplacement of the path and the use of the path is troubling. He stated that\nthis is not a comfortable discussion for him.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan stated that he is uncomfortable to negotiate with so\nlittle information. He suggested moving this forward without a recommendation\nand this will be before the City Council at the July 29th meeting and it will\ngive petitioners time to address the concerns of the Ordinance Committee and\nprovide information requested. This provides the City Council with the\nopportunity to fully weigh the cost and benefits of this project. He commented\nthat as difficult it is for his colleagues to say yes to this project; it\nwould also be difficult to say no to 15 units of affordable housing (20,000\nsquare feet of affordable housing) because they are family units. He added\nthat it is difficult for him to say to the first truly Net Zero project in\nCambridge. He stated that he would like to see the whole site be affordable\nhousing but short of the City Council rezoning this it cannot be guaranteed.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux stated that the City Council is perfectly willing to\nrezone for developers and cannot see why not rezone for the City. She stated\nthat with the current FAR at 1.25 there could be 55,000 square feet of storage\nwould be allowed on this size lot and with this petition it is being doubled\nat 110,000 square feet. She felt that there could be more housing. She\ncommented that 20,000 square feet is a small amount of the total square\nfootage. She stated that they are getting a bonus. She stated that she does\nnot know what commercially viable is as stated in the petition. The City\nCouncil is up-zoning something without enough information. She asked the Clerk\nto outline the procedural aspect of the petition in relation to the summer\nmeeting. In response to the question by Vice Mayor Devereux, Ms. Lopez stated\nthat the Committee Report would be on the agenda for the July 29th City\nCouncil Meeting. She stated that the decision of what to do with this petition\nis up to the City Council. This could be passed to a second reading at the\nJuly 29th meeting and then there is time from the July 29th meeting to\nSeptember 24 to further negotiate or discuss more with the petitioner before\nordination.\n\nCouncillor Kelley spoke about a zoning petition to up zone the quadrangle and\nthere will be benefits associated with this and there may be benefits\nassociated with other zoning proposal as well. He stated that this is the way\nthat business is done but he would like to know that the City Council is\nconfident if this gets passed that the hardest and best bargain has been\nreceived on behalf of the City.\n\nAttorney Rafferty stated that the petitioners are willing to provide the\ninformation requested by the City Council and to work further on the MOU with\nJAS. He stated that the calendar reality is that if the petition does not\nleave the Ordinance Committee in time for the opportunity to be on the July\n29th agenda the petition would run out of time to do the substantive work. He\nstated that hearing the concerns expressed, particularly on the path, the\npetitioners will go back to CDD to discuss the benefits of the path. Other\nthan the width there may be other short comings with the path that will make\nit not viable. He noted that there is time between now and the July 29th\nmeeting and between the July 29th meeting and the expiration date of the\npetition. He noted that if this is not referred to City Council for July 29th\nSpecial City Council meeting there will be no time for further discussion\nabout this opportunity. He stated that the one consensus he is hearing from\nthe City Council is that this does represent an opportunity and if this is an\nopportunity worth exploring the petitioners would welcome the chance to\ncontinue to work with the staff to provide the details needed to get the City\nCouncil in a position of knowledge, particularly on the cost of construction.\nHe stated that with the presence of JAS there is experience with building\nhousing. He stated that there is credibility and a track record that can be\nbuilt upon with providing the City Council with additional information.\n\nCouncillor Kelley moved to refer the petition to the full City Council without\na recommendation.  The motion carried on a voice vote six members. Vice Mayor\nDevereux was recorded in negative.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that information is being requested to further\nunderstand the value that is being generated that JAS or another non-profit\nwill be able to count on. He requested more understanding on architecture and\nquality of finishes so that it is a positive addition to the street. Vice\nMayor Devereux regarding the renderings wanted to see views not from above but\nfrom all side and there will be blank walls that are facing Bay State Road.\nCouncillor Carlone commented that if this use is going to be it has to be a\npositive on all sides.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux noted that the Planning Board mentioned that the language\nin the petition was unclear. She made the following motion:\n\nORDERED: That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to instruct the\nCommunity Development Department to revise the language in the  New Street\nOverlay petition and to include in the revision the  following changes:\n\n20.95.1 (1) by striking out 8,000 and inserting 20,000 square feet;\n\n20.94.1 and 20.96.1 entitled Maximum Height be amended by adding  at the end\nthe words \u201cprovided, however that no building shall exceed  55 feet without\ncomplying with a 45-degree bulk plain.\u201d\n\nThe question now came on the motion and the motion carried on a voice vote of\nseven members.\n\nThe following communication was received and made part of the report.\n\nRobin Bonner, 15 Corporal Burns Road, urging the Ordinance Committee not to\napprove the petition (ATTACHMENT C).\n\nCouncillor Carlone and Councillor Kelley thanked all those present for their\nattendance.\n\nThe hearing adjourned at 5:46 PM.\n\nFor the Committee,\n\n__________________________________\n\nCouncillor Dennis J. Carlone, Co-Chair\n\nCouncillor Craig Kelley, Co-Chair\n\nOrdinance Committee\n\n"

Denise Simmons\n\nCouncillor Quinton Zondervan\n\n|  \n  \n---|---  \n  \nRECONVENED ORDINANCE HEARING FROM AUGUST 13, 2019 ON THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING\nOVERLAY DISTRICT\n\nOn September 3, 2019 Councillor Carlone reconvened the Ordinance Committee\nhearing from August 13, 2019 at 12:06 PM in the Sullivan Chamber to continue\ndiscussions on proposed amendments to the Affordable Housing Overlay District\npetition. He announced that there will be no public comment. He announced that\nthe hearing was being televised.\n\nPresent were: Councillor Carlone, Vice Mayor Devereux, Councillor Mallon,\nCouncillor\n\nSimmons, Councillor Siddiqui, Mayor McGovern, Councillor Kelley, Councillor\nZondervan,\n\nCouncillor Toomey, Erik Thorkildsen, Urban Designer, CDD, City Solicitor Nancy\nGlowa, Chris\n\nCotter, Director of Housing, CDD, Jeff Roberts, Senior Manager of Zoning and\nDevelopment,\n\nCDD, Cassie Arnaud, Housing Planning, CDD, City Clerk Anthony Wilson, Will\nDurbin, Chief of\n\nStaff for Mayor McGovern and Donna P.

He noted that the City\nis the petitioner and there are handouts distributed by Community Development\nDepartment including an Affordable Housing Zoning proposal, comparison charts\ndated August 29, 2019 (ATTACHMENT 46), a memo from Community Development dated\nAugust 29, 2019, additions to the Affordable Housing Overlay petition are\nhighlighted in blue and Design Guidelines for 100% Affordable Housing Overlay\nDraft dated August 29, 2019. He stated that is also a handout compiled by the\nMayor\u2019s Office as of September 3, 2019 with the amendments to the Affordable\nHousing Overlay and this will be used as a guide (ATTACHMENT 47). There is\nalso a handout that outlines which amendments are on hold, pending language\nfrom City Solicitor and the items that were referred to Community Development\nDepartment (ATTACHMENT 48).\n\nMr. Roberts gave an overview of the material submitted to the Ordinance\nCommittee by e-mail last Thursday. The main document is a revised version of\nthe zoning text (ATTACHMENT 49). There were changes to the proposal that were\nvoted on by the Ordinance Committee and they have been incorporated into the\nzoning text and made some clarifying changes based on comments by the Planning\nBoard that needed clarification. He spoke about clarifying edits which have\nalso been incorporated into the revised text and includes commentary on the\nright side to be able to identify the substantive changes. He stated that\nthere is a memo on CDD letter head transmitting supplemental information on\nquestions that were asked at the previous Ordinance Committee hearings\n(ATTACHMENT 50). This memo includes commentary information relating to Net\nZero Ready Buildings, Displacement/Relocation Assistance, Transportation\nDemand Management Requirements, Density Limits/FAR Caps, Applicability and\nImport of the Tree Ordinance and Historic Preservation and greater\nclarification about language in the zoning related to the State Register of\nHistoric Places. He stated that another document was an updated comparison\ncharts and maps that illustrate the provision of the Affordable Housing\nOverlay compared to the base zoning limitations across the base zoning\ndistricts in the zoning ordinance (ATTACHMENT 51). He noted that this was\npresented with the original proposal and this has been updated based on the\nrecent set of changes voted by the Ordinance Committee. He stated that there\nis an updated set of Design Guidelines incorporating comments made by the\nOrdinance Committee (ATTACHMENT 52). Mr. Thorkildsen will provide a summary of\nthe changes.\n\nCouncillor Carlone asked if the key points be reviewed by the staff in the\npresentation. Mr. Roberts stated that he will go through the substantive\nchanges to the zoning text. Councillor Carlone noted that the FAR is\ndifferent. Mr. Roberts stated that in response to a change to FAR staff looked\nat. He stated that there was a report that went to the City Council that was\nprepared with assistance from the Assessing Department. The basis for AHO\nproposal is the notation for site to be acquired and for the ability to do\naffordable housing developments in a way where sites could be feasible\nacquired and develop would require greater density in order to spread the\nacquisition costs for sites over a greater number of units. The conclusion\ndepending on the site and acquisition costs of site there could a lot of\nvariation but as an approximate mid-point in lower density residential\ndistricts an affordable housing project would need to have a FAR of 2 in order\nto come up with a feasible acquisition per unit. He stated that a FAR of 2 was\nseen in those districts as a reasonable limitation that would allow affordable\nhousing developments to be feasible on sites in the lower density areas. He\nstated that as the analysis that was done shows that there are some sites that\nthis would not be feasible and some it would be depending on the character and\nnature of the site. This was seen to be a reasonable limitation on density.\n\nMr. Cotter stated that there were several amendments that introduced the idea\nof FAR and the City Council asked CDD staff to review this and come back with\ncomments as to what would be an appropriate FAR. He stated that building from\nthe analysis recently done with the Assessors and the market to see what level\nof density might be needed in order to make more sites possible for affordable\nhousing development. He stated that he feels comfortable with the FAR of 2.0\neven before discussing the form-based approach that was discussed is deriving\nfrom a FAR of 2.0. He stated that with the interest in having a cap on density\nin the neighbor districts this was taken as a good reason to bring up the 2.0\nagain. This has been put into the petition and was noted in the memo.\nCouncillor Carlone commented that the non-applicable on the higher density\nzones means that there is no change in the high-density zones. Mr. Cotter\nresponded in the affirmative and stated that there is no cap on FAR that would\napply in the neighborhood districts where the FAR is under 1 there would be a\ncap set at 2. There is no theorical cap in the corridors or the areas expected\nto see development, but there is a cap based on the size of the building\nenvisioned based on the number of stories and height. Councillor Carlone asked\nif the lower density districts being affected and was there any studies done\non A2, B, C and C1. Mr. Roberts stated that site study models were previously\npresented; there were several site development alternatives that modeled a\nbuilding outcome that would be at a FAR of 2. He explained that when the\nmodels were done, they were not shown in specific locations. It was decided\nthat it was preferable to show more generic context rather than picking\nspecific sites. The examples are shown in a context with a range of different\nbuildings that may be typical in Res. A, B, or C or lower density districts.\nThere were 2 alternatives shown. One alternative had more units and less\nparking with a FAR of 2.4. This would exceed the limitation. The second\nalternative, referred to as Site 3 Alternative B, shows parking on the site\nwith a FAR of 2. Councillor Carlone asked that the alternatives be resubmitted\nand reworded and that it be based on the submission of today.\n\nMr. Thorkildsen provided a summary of the changes to the Design Guidelines.\nThe change is in the way that the Guidelines are presented, and the language\nwas simplified. The introduction was revised. The text was cleaned up and\nincluded principals and objectives and included Historical Guidelines and\nincluded illustrations. Councillor Carlone commented that these are still\nsuggestions. Mr. Thorkildsen stated that these are recommended guidelines and\nnot directives.\n\nCity Solicitor Glowa commented on the definitions of abutters and public way.\nMs. Glowa stated that the abutter language is included in the revised text.\nShe stated that on page 23 language has been incorporated from the zoning\nordinance and Chapter 40A regarding notice and to whom notice is sent. She\nstated that she is unclear on what she was to provide committee and welcomes\nfurther guidance to provide the information. She stated that received a\ndocument that refers to 36A amendment and does not appear to be related to\npublic ways. Councillor Carlone noted that there was some concern about how\nthe public way is defined. He noted that there is an amendment to 36A which\nadds \u201cand the public way.\u201d City Clerk Wilson referred to section 7.6 in the\nordinance there are four subsections and there is a proposal to amend\nsubsection (d) that reads New outdoor light fixtures installed in an AHO\nproject shall be fully shielded and directed to prevent light trespass onto\nadjacent residential lots and the public way. He noted that a question at the\nlast Ordinance Committee hearing was how to appropriately define public way.\nCouncillor Carlone stated that there was not a definitive definition on public\nway and informed the City Solicitor that she could get back to the Ordinance\nCommittee on this. City Solicitor Glowa stated that it is unclear what\nguidance is sought. She stated that there is some light on public ways, and it\nis not clear whether the committee is looking for language that would keep all\nlight from being shed onto any public way. She stated that she could provide\nsuggested language at the next meeting. Vice Mayor Devereux stated that in the\nrevised Design Guidelines there is now a reference to following some of the\nsuggestion in the Outdoor Lighting Ordinance which was never adopted. She\nstated that the example that she used was the light at the Tobin School that\nwas not shielded and was intended to be a security light for the school which\nwent well beyond the school grounds and blinded pedestrians who were passing.\nThis was a precaution to acknowledge that lighting that is on a property can\nspill out into the public way and not be pleasant to pedestrians and not\nprovide security. She did not know how to put this into zoning language. City\nSolicitor Glowa wanted to figure out how best to address this issue.\nCouncillor Carlone stated that this maybe shielded from the public but letting\nsome indirect light go forward. This is about is glare that the Vice Mayor is\nreferring to. City Solicitor Glowa stated that there is a difference between\nbeing shielded and not shedding any light. She stated that there are other\nplaces in the zoning ordinance that talks about shielding from direct light\ntrespass onto neighboring properties. She stated that she would work on a\nproposal that is more refined to get to what the committee is getting at.\n\nCouncillor Carlone proceeded to the amendments that were placed on hold.\n\nAmendment # 1. Councillor Carlone moved to modify his amendment to remove\nstriking out the word \u201climited.\u201d He stated the question is, is 4 times the\nincrease in zoning worthy of the word limited being removed. Vice Mayor\nDevereux stated that the word limited in this sentence refers to height. This\nis limited increases in height. She noted that a previous amendment she\noffered was to add the word incremental. She noted that the increases in\nheight are somewhat limited. On an affirmative vote of 9 members the amendment\ncarried.  City Solicitor noted that the word \u201cincremental\u201d was adopted by the\nOrdinance Committee on August 8th. Councillor Carlone noted that the word\n\u201cincremental\u201d was approved on Amendment # 5. Councillor Carlone Councillor\nCarlone moved to modify his amendment to add after the word \u201callow\u201d the word\n\u201cincremental\u201d and leave in the word limited. On an affirmative vote of 9\nmembers the amendment carried.\n\nAmendment # 2. Councillor Carlone noted that this was an amendment by\nCouncillor Zondervan to include in the Affordable Housing Overlay Eligible\nHouseholds by adding at the end the words \u201cor a household that was living in a\nbuilding that is built or refurbished under the AHO.\u201d\n\nCouncillor Simmons stated that she finds this restrictive and will not support\nit. She noted that this throws off the AMI configurations. She stated that\nthis is more troublesome and requested that it be removed.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux asked Councillor Zondervan if the household that was\nliving in a building that was either rebuilt or refurbished through the AHO\nmet the guidelines for being an AHO tenant is this the intent. Councillor\nZondervan responded that this would already be covered by the existing\nlanguage. The amendment was to address a situation where tenants are above the\nincome limits and are displaced from their home and would not be allowed to\nreturn.\n\nCouncillor Simmons spoke about the funding that AHO projects would have. She\nnoted that this is addressed in the memo by CDD. She stated that if an\nindividual is at market rate and moves out and this will bring the tenant back\nin. She stated that this is not the purpose of the AHO; the AHO is for\nindividuals under a certain percentage of AMI. Mr. Cotter noted that\ndisplacement relocation was addressed in the CDD memo. He stated that the goal\nis not to displace household and work with households to the extent where\nrelocation may be needed whether it is temporary. In the case where households\nmay be eligible for AHO housing that may be created or permitted where a\nhousing provider will work to help someone identify options either within\ntheir other affordable housing stock or within the market. This is problematic\nto have this type of definition in the zoning because it could conflict with\nrequirements of funding sources as well as present logistical issues where a\nfamily may need to be moved to create a housing for seniors and to offer them\nthe right to return would be challenging in terms of compatibility if a\nbuilding is designed for a certain population it may not be appropriate to\nhave tenants move back and they may have been options in a different type of\nhousing. He added that from a policy perspective this is supported and would\nwant to work through this with the housing providers but to have that element\nof the definition could be challenging from a practical standpoint as to how\nAHO housing projects would be financed. On a voice vote amendment # 2 failed.\n\nAmendment # 3. Councillor Carlone stated that this is the definition of a Net\nZero Ready Building.\n\nCouncillor Carlone read the proposed definition. He stated that affordable\nhousing developments are more efficient than market rate housing because of\ncosts and eliminating long-term heating and cooling costs. He stated that this\ndefinition connects with a later amendment on making buildings meet this\nstandard. He favors doing as much as possible to be efficient.\n\nMr. Cotter this was addressed in the memo and recommended in the memo\nrequiring a narrative for affordable housing projects to show a path to net\nzero at some point in the future recognizing that getting to net zero at this\npoint can be prohibitively expensive and could undermine efforts to create\naffordable housing if this requirement were set. He stated that affordable\nhousing is seen as performing better and advancing sustainability for using\nrenewables and making the efforts to create housing that will be better for\nresidents, the community and to operate over time. This is challenging to have\nthis requirement if this were to be a prescriptive requirement. He stated that\nthis definition is challenging as it refers to maximizing without setting\nstandards. He stated that if there were such a definition it was recommended\nthat there are clear standards so that an affordable housing provider would\nknow what the baseline is to meet that definition. He noted that the goal and\nintention is appreciated but recommends approaching this in a different way.\nCouncillor Carlone stated that the recommendation is to treat this as part of\nthe overall Net Zero Action Plan as far as phasing and not penalize\nprospective affordable housing. Mr. Cotter stated that the intent in this\nconcept for the AHO petition which was to look at affordable housing providers\nand not require anything more of them than is now required in the market but\ntrying to give them the advantages to better compete in the market recognizing\nthat the challenges to do that now.\n\nCouncillor Simmons suggested striking out this language based on the\nrecommendations from CDD. She acknowledged that the affordable housing\ndevelopers built to the highest efficient standards. She noted that this\nencumbers that process.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan stated that the City cannot allow emissions to increase\nand causing climate change to continue to worsen and causing death. In 2013 a\npetition was filed that asked the City to increase energy efficiency\nrequirements and to require new construction be net zero and nothing has been\ndone to date. The City builds net zero with the King Open School Complex and\nleads by example and cannot ask affordable housing developers to build net\nzero. He stated that this is not prohibitively expensive, and it is\ninappropriate to use this term. He added that there is a health and safety\nissue as well where burning gas in buildings pollutes the indoor air and is\nunhealthy for the occupants. This does not maximize energy efficiency and are\nburdening the tenants with unnecessary high utility bills. He stated that from\na climate change perspective for the City to say that it needs to continue to\nbuild buildings that continue to add to emissions, continue to make climate\nchange worse and continue to kill people is not acceptable to him. Councillor\nCarlone stated that in the Net Zero Plan what are the projected dates for\nhousing to be Net Zero. Councillor Zondervan responded it is 2022 for small\nresidential construction and 2025 for large residential and commercial\nbuildings. He added that many of the affordable housing projects would not\nfall under the Net Zero requirements until 2025.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux spoke about the CDD memo and asked why there would be a\ndifferent way to do this through a net zero narrative and if adopted this\nrequirement would apply to affordable housing projects subject to Green\nBuilding Requirements, generally projects of 25,000 square feet or more. When\nwill the Green Building Requirements be adopted? She stated that a project of\n25,000 square feet is a 25-unit building. She stated that it is not clear to\nher how many smaller AHO projects there will be and asked if there will be AHO\nprojects that will be less than 25,000 square feet. Mr. Cotter spoke about the\ntypes of affordable housing this would affect. He stated that it is expected\nto see a range of project types and a way to think about this is the number of\nunits and more units are expected in larger buildings along the corridors. One\nof the goals of the petition is to create opportunities in areas of the City\nwhere there is no affordable housing. He spoke about the types of projects\nexpected with a cap of 2.0 is expected to be on smaller sites in the City. He\nstated that goal to create sustainable buildings is shared and is in the\nhousing priorities. He stated that this is to create affordable housing and\nthe more that the affordable housing providers are asked to do other things\nthe more the intent is undermined. When this was reviewed with the housing\nproviders the reaction was that it would be more challenging to meet the\nrequirement. He stated that if the zoning has this type of requirement of a\nnarrative for buildings that are 25,000 square feet it would become a\nfundamental eligibility criterion for the AHO.\n\nMr. Roberts addressed the question about the updates to Green Building\nRequirement. He stated that they are currently being worked on and will be\nforwarded to the City Council shortly. This is complex and the roll out of the\nNZAP. He stated that part of the complexity is that it does not fall entirely\nwithin the realm of zoning. This needs to work with the energy code\nrequirements which are not regulated by zoning. He stated that finding the\nright way to balance zoning along with other standards and requirements and\nfiguring out what can and cannot be regulated is part of the challenge. He\nstated the roll out complexity of the standards will be worked on by various\ndepartments.\n\nCouncillor Kelley appreciates the sentiment and the language that the City is\ncontinuing to build buildings that are killing people is super extreme and not\nsuper helpful. He stated that the City has passed a plan but is still waiting\non a variety of ordinance suggestions to include things like modifying the\nzoning to allow for different types of insulation that would otherwise bring\nthe building into non-compliance. He noted that there are no zoning\nrequirements that push to Net Zero, there is a plan. Mr. Roberts stated that\nthe AHO zoning proposal refers to the Green Building requirements. He stated\nthat as part of the NZAP there are changes to Green Building Requirements that\ntrack the recommendations of the NZAP and includes moving from a baseline\nstandard from LEED Silver to LEED Gold. There are other association\nimprovements. She stated that there are other changes coming with this\npackage, such as flexibility in some zoning standards that are meant to enable\nadding insulation to an existing building which may be non-conforming and may\nencounter issues with zoning if trying to add insulation to the exterior of a\nbuilding. He stated that in the AHO included some flexibility in the zoning\nthat would enable these types of improvements. He stated that there are\nincreases in requirements that need to be met but there are also changes meant\nto create more flexibility in the zoning that would enable improvements that\nmight otherwise not be able to be made. Councillor Kelley stated that he is\nconfused about what is required at this point and the down the line\nrequirements for creating this plan. He is under the impression that it is\nbeing done but not part of the zoning yet. He stated that this proposed\namendment seems to leapfrog over current City efforts to change the zoning and\nother rules to bring people into Net Zero. He added at some point the current\nefforts will come to the City Council in the form of similar zoning changes.\nMr. Roberts responded in the affirmative and further stated that the approach\nwith this proposal as initially conceived is for projects being built under\nthe AHO to continue to track the same environmental standards that would apply\nto comparable residential developments and as they change in the future then\naffordable housing projects over this AHO as well as all other residential\nprojects would be subject to the same uniform set of standards.\n\nCouncillor Mallon stated that there are extensive efforts that are being put\ninto place, and this does leapfrog. She spoke about the memo from CDD\nregarding requiring AHO projects to build to Net Zero standards sooner than\notherwise required for all development would put affordable housing builders\nat a disadvantage relative to the developers of market rate housing. She\nstated that it is important not see any more stunting of affordable housing\nand does not want this to stop affordable housing from being built. She stated\nthat she will not support this because of leapfrogging.\n\nAt this time Councillor Carlone called for the vote on amendment # 3. On this\nmotion the roll was called and resulted as follows:\n\nYEAS: Councillor Carlone, Vice Mayor Devereux, Councillor Kelley and\nCouncillor\n\nZondervan \\- 4\n\nNAYS: Councillor Mallon, Councillor Siddiqui, Councillor Simmons, Councillor\nToomey and Mayor McGovern \\- 5\n\nABSENT: None \\- 0\n\nand amendment # 3 \u2013\n\nFailed.\n\nAmendment # 4. Councillor Carlone moved to remove this amendment to add a\ndefinition for Permeable Parking. On an affirmative vote of 9 member the\namendment was adopted.\n\nAmendment # 7. Councillor Carlone amendment was to add after Section 4.35. the\nwords \u201cAll such ground floor uses shall\u201d. He stated that in the revised text\non page 5 contains language. He stated that his amendment was services shall\nbe provided to the general public.\n\nCouncillor Mallon stated that in her notes from August 8th she has that this\namendment would be discussed with amendment # 32 which was around retail space\nand whether it could be a use that was non-retail but active related to\nabutters. Councillor Carlone noted that this is what the zoning specificity\ncalls out. This is active uses. She stated that on page 19 of the revised text\nin (e) it appears that CDD took the spirit and intention of #7 and #32 and put\nthem together in (e). Councillor Carlone noted that question is the word \u201cmay\u201d\nor \u201cshall.\u201d\n\nMr. Roberts spoke about section 11.207.4 entitle \u201cUse.\u201d This sets forth what\nuses are allowed. It is important to establish clearly what uses are allowed.\nHe explained that the AHO only applies to residential uses but there is an\nexception in an affordable housing overlay project can have some non-\nresidential uses at the ground floor and it is important to clarify what those\nuses are. In the revised text the reason for the addition is has to do with\nsection 4.34 includes both office and lab uses and there was a question if\nthis meant to include labs and that it would be helpful to clarify that it is\nonly office. This is the reason for the text Paragraphs a. through e. This\njust states what uses are allowed and this is the intent. He stated that if\nthe City wants to be expansive and encourage active ground floor use it is\nhelpful to be as expansive as is reasonable so that there are different\noptions for what that space can be used for. Councillor Carlone noted that\nsome districts require active ground floor, but this would negate that. Mr.\nRoberts stated that this section of the zoning is meant to establish that in\nany zone in districts that allows non-residential uses and could be districts\nthat allow institutional uses, such as community centers, libraries or social\nservices and could include business districts that allow retail use or office\ndistricts that allow office uses that in those districts if an affordable\nhousing development is being built under the AHO it can have one of these\nallowed uses at the ground floor. He stated that this zoning can be utilized\nfor a project that is all affordable housing plus one of these listed non-\nresidential uses that are otherwise allowed in the base zoning at the ground\nfloor. This is not restrictive.\n\nCouncillor Kelley is confused about stories at ground, above and below grade\nwhich is found on page 18 of the revised text in paragraph (f) and what is\nallowed at ground stories. Councillor Carlone stated that this will be\naddressed later.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that based on the explanation of Mr. Roberts he\nmoved to remove his amendment. On an affirmative vote of 9 members the\namendment was removed.\n\nAmendment # 8. Councillor Carlone stated that this is an amendment submitted\nby Councillor Zondervan to insert in Section 4 Use a new (b) (i).\n\nCouncillor Zondervan stated that the idea is to protect existing retail or\nother services being provided on ground floor in a building that is\npotentially being redeveloped under the AHO. He stated that the motivation\nbehind this is that there are a lot of single-story buildings along the\ntransit corridors that should have housing on the top. This overlay attempts\nto create these incentives that will allow this to happen. He stated that\nwithout protection for these existing businesses or small business this would\nmake it less likely that those sites would get developed. He spoke about Mayor\nMcGovern\u2019s concern about formula businesses but those can and often are owned\nby local small business owners who are operating a franchise under a formula\nbusiness brand. He stated that this underscores the tension and the challenge\nwith this approach because the City is trying to achieve many of the goals at\nthe same time and cannot simply prioritize one goal at the expense of others.\nHe stated that there needs to be some way to protect these existing buildings\nand using this protection as a way to unlock those development opportunities\nso that both goals of producing more affordable housing and promoting small\nlocal businesses and maintaining vitality on the street. Councillor Carlone\nstated that he agreed but the amendment is very specific in a rental amount of\n5% of the annual gross income. Councillor Zondervan commented that he meant to\nstate no greater than 5%. He stated that this was provided as the right amount\nto limit so that the business would be able to operate in that space. He spoke\nabout the vacant storefront across the City because of the high rents and\nfurther stated that it is important to put a limit on the rent so that these\nbusinesses are not being displaced.\n\nMayor McGovern stated that he is opposed to this because affordable housing\ndeveloper would have to relocate a major business and does not want to do this\non the back of affordable housing developers; this is not required of for-\nprofit developers. He is open to any amendment that does not undermine the\nfinancial viability of affordable housing. This would be impossible for an\naffordable housing developer to do. He stated that the City needs to look at\nhow to better support, particularly small businesses but putting this on the\nbacks of affordable housing developers is not right.\n\nCouncillor Siddiqui agreed with the Mayor. She stated that legally this is not\ntenable. This amendment is unreasonably impractical. There is one goal from\nthe beginning which is to figure out how to make affordable housing more cost\neffective and this gets in the way of this goal. She commented that the City\nis trying to figure out what can be done to help the City\u2019s retailers. This\ndoes not make sense.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that this is an important issue and it needs to be\nresolved.\n\nCouncillor Simmons understands the idea behind the amendment but it is putting\na burden on something that we are trying to correct through an economic\ndevelopment perspective on the AHO. She added that the AHO is not the place\nfor a cure all. This is prohibitive. She stated that the community-based\nbuilders have stated that because of so many restrictions and financial\nburdens it is hard to build affordable housing. She stated that this amendment\nmay be well-intended it is a putting a strain on building affordable housing\nand making it prohibitive. She requested Councillor Zondervan to withdraw his\namendment or she would have to vote against it.\n\nCouncillor Kelley asked when a Special Permit is issued outside of the\nMassachusetts Avenue Overlay District it requires some amount of retail at the\nground floor could the Planning Board require absent the base zoning that\nthere be retail set aside for a project. City Solicitor Glowa responded that\nthe only way that the Planning Board can impose such a requirement is if it\nexists somewhere within the ordinance provisions that relate to that Special\nPermit. Councillor Kelley spoke about Huron Village which does not have a\nground floor retail requirement and if an individual purchased property today\nand developed it per the zoning ordinance they would not be required, and the\nPlanning Board could not require them to put in ground floor retail. Mr.\nRoberts stated that if zoning does not require it, it cannot be specifically\nrequired. The Planning Board as part of a more holistic project review takes\ninto account the character of the area, what the planning for the area\ndictates and the desirable outcome. He stated that there are instances where\nthe Planning Board reviews a project for the first time and comments that the\nproject would be approved if there were retail at some place in the project on\nthe ground floor and this is something that evolves through project review. He\nstated that in the context of this proposal it would not be appropriate for\nthe Planning Board to require a particular retailer be brought back or put\nprovisions in place regarding the commercial rents that could be charged.\nCouncillor Kelley stated that the lack of a Special Permit process which is\nproposed for a variety of reasons and this changes the discussion for whatever\nprojects might come. He stated that if the AHO gets passed the rules change\ndramatically and it is difficult to compare the new rules with current rules.\nHe stated that there is some ability for the Planning Board to push a project\nto have ground floor retail where the underlining zoning does not require it\nbut is not codified and cannot push overly hard. Mr. Roberts stated that much\nthat is in the AHO proposal does acknowledge that in many areas of the City\nprojects do not require review by the Planning Board. But the acknowledgement\nof the AHO is meant to create a permitting path that would not require a\nSpecial Permit or Variance where they may otherwise might be required. He\nnoted that the AHO does impose specific requirements. He noted that the\ncommittee was currently discussing an amendment on relocation and rent for\nexisting retailers. He stated that elsewhere in the AHO there is a requirement\nthat in certain business districts where retail uses are allowed if there is\nan existing retail use then the AHO must produce an active ground floor space\nthat was intended to continue and support the street front character of the\narea.\n\nMayor McGovern stated that it would be helpful to stick with the amendment\nthat is in front of the committee. He announced that these changes only apply\nunder a very strict set of rules. This is not about all development or all\nzoning. He stated that if a 100% affordable housing development is not being\nbuilt the extra height and the streamline permitting process does not apply.\nIt is important to note that under very specific projects only do these\nchanges apply. This is for a 100% affordable housing projects only.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that one of the prime areas for redevelopment is\none-story retail districts and will have an impact with retail that is\nstruggling.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux stated that there is a place mentioned later where it\nstates that if there is existing retail in a business district and refers to\nthe AHO. She asked where this appears in the revised text. Mr. Cotter stated\nthat this on page 18 in the revised text in paragraph (e). The Ordinance\nCommittee amended the text from and to or. These would require an AHO project\nto include ground floor retail in projects that are built on site that had a\nformer retail site or abut another parcel that has a retail use. Mayor\nMcGovern stated that (e) on page 18 of the revised text is not the amendment\nbeing discussed. He added that the amendment before the committee is an\namendment submitted by Councillor Zondervan about relocation fees and bringing\nretail back.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux stated that on August 13th the Ordinance Committee voted\non this. She added that it is important to remember that the committee did\nvote on a provision for maintaining retail. She stated that she understands\nthat the amendment by Councillor Zondervan is different but wanted the\ncommittee to have the conversation about relocation also remembering that\nthere was a vote to keep the local retail. She added that clearly there is a\ngreat deal of confusion about what this zoning actually states.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan commented that this amendment is being characterized as\ncreating an obstacle to affordable housing development and most of these sites\nwill not be developed if there is not some provision to protect the existing\nretailer in the building. He stated that by not having this provision this is\nexcluding good sites for affordable housing development and this is to unlock\nmore opportunities for affordable housing and if the associated costs are not\npaid for them the affordable housing will not be built. He stated that this\nwhole zoning is built on the fact that the City is funding, to a large extent,\nthis affordable housing construction. He stated that if the zoning is only\naddressed and these other obstacles are not the goals may not be achieved of\nunlocking more affordable housing opportunities. There is a need for something\nto protect existing businesses in sites that really should have 2-4 stories of\naffordable housing above the retail.\n\nCouncillor Simmons stated that she did not agree with this in this context.\nShe commented that the zoning is a living document. She recommended vote the\namendments the body can and then come back to the other amendments. She urged\nCouncillor Zondervan to withdraw this amendment or let the Ordinance Committee\nvote on this.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that this is an important issue and this needs to be\nsolved. There are other communities that builds affordable housing above\nretail.\n\nThe question now came on the amendment and the roll was called and resulted as\nfollows:\n\nYEAS: Councillor Carlone, Councillor Kelley and Councillor Zondervan \\- 3\n\nNAYS: Councillor Mallon, Councillor Siddiqui, Councillor Simmons, Councillor\nToomey and\n\nMayor McGovern \\- 5\n\nABSENT: None \\- 0\n\nPRESENT: Vice Mayor Devereux \\- 1\n\nand amendment # 8 \u2013\n\nFailed.\n\nAmendment #13 and #14. Councillor Carlone stated that this has been modified\nin the presentation by CDD. It was FAR in any district.\n\nMayor McGovern moved adoption of the recommendations by CDD appearing in the\nrevised text as 11.207.5.2.2 Residential Density sections (a) and (b).\n\nMr. Roberts stated that his understanding from the last hearing is that there\nwere some different amendments proposed that would have set different\nstandards for density limitation and were discussed by the Ordinance\nCommittee. The Ordinance Committee asked CDD to review the matter further and\ncame forth with a suggestion.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan stated that he believed that he also had an amendment in\na different location. The amendment was part of Amendment # 36 in subsection\n(d) as follows: Notwithstanding any other requirements, any building permitted\nthrough the AHO shall be limited to a Floor Area Ratio (FAR) of 3.0 or double\nthe base zoning, whichever is less, to ensure sufficient land area for green\nspace to mitigate heat and flooding considerations of climate change. Mayor\nMcGovern stated that there were three amendments that dealt with FAR.\n\nMayor McGovern moved to strike amendment # 13. On an affirmative vote of 9\nmembers the amendment was adopted.\n\nCouncillor Carlone moved to strike amendment # 14. On an affirmative vote of 9\nmembers the amendment was adopted.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux questioned the BA-4 district created on Waldon and Sherman\nStreets relating to the Masse Development. She stated that it would not be\nincluded in 2.0 cap; this is a small district. She asked if this was an\noversight by CDD not to because it allows height taller than the Masse\nBuilding which is under 45 feet.\n\nMr. Robert stated that the overarching principal here is to apply the same\nvariations in height and density for affordable housing development under\noverlay within districts that are roughly comparable to each other. The BA-4\ndistrict was modified to allow a specific development on a specific site, in\nterms of the overall density and height limitations it is comparable to a\nBusiness A or a Business A-2 district. He stated that adjustments were made to\nmake the height lower and density higher but in most respects the density and\nheight are very comparable to Business A. He stated that under this AHO we\nwanted to treat those districts in roughly comparable ways. Across all these\ndistricts, under the most recent height amendment adopted by the Ordinance\nCommittee where it currently allows 44-45 feet the AHO would allow six story\nbuildings. Vice Mayor Devereux stated that she does not think this should be\nbecause the Sherman Street district was created specifically to be financially\nfeasible for this development to put parking underground. This density was\nincreased; the height was not increased. She stated that putting a 6-7 story\nbuilding on Walden Street near Sherman Street is not the outcome wanted. This\nmakes it equivalent to what is allowed on North Massachusetts Avenue in a BA-2\ndistrict. This district cannot support a 60-70-foot high building with an\nunlimited FAR. Councillor Carlone comment that this is an unusual district in\nthat there is very little business in this location. Vice Mayor Devereux does\nnot think that the BA-4 district extends across Walden Street to include\nPaddy\u2019s. She stated that the zoning for this section should be looked at more\nclosely to see what the City wants to see there. Councillor Kelley asked if\nVice Mayor Devereux was submitting amendment of not. Vice Mayor Devereux\nstated that this came up because she was looking at where the 2.0 FAR does not\napply and prompted her to look at why it does not apply and it is because the\ncut off for capping at 2.0 was to say which ones under the current zoning have\na 1.0 FAR or less and because this one was up zoned to help the developer to\ncreate to 27 units of housing on the corner lot it was up zoned to 1.75 or 2.0\nFAR if it has ground floor retail. This was zoning to enable one project.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux made the following motion:\n\nORDERED: That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to instruct the\nCommunity Development Department to review both the density and height under\nthe AHO for the BA-4 district and make a recommendation to the Ordinance\nCommittee.\n\nThe motion was adopted on an affirmative vote of 8 members. Councillor Simmons\nwas recorded\n\nas present.\n\nMayor McGovern stated that he had previously made a motion to accept the\nrecommendation of CDD for 2.0 and suggested voting on this amendment together\nwith the amendment offered by Councillor Zondervan.\n\nThe recommendation by CDD was in the revised text in section 11.207.5.2.2\nResidential Density in subsection (a).\n\nCouncillor Carlone questioned that the only place the AHO will work is in\nareas with a FAR of less than 1.00. Mr. Roberts stated that the proposal is to\nestablish a limit on the FAR in districts where the current district standards\nwould limit it to 1.0 or less. In other districts there would be no maximum\nFAR. This would be as originally proposed where the development density would\nbe limited by the overall height and the other dimensional controls that are\nin place and there would not be a numerical limit on FAR.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan stated that the comparison chart has a table that shows\neach district FAR and the proposed limit. He stated that his understanding of\nthe language is that it only applies if the FAR is less than 1.0. Mr. Roberts\nstated that there is no district that is 1.0.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux stated that this is trying to make these projects more\nfinancially attainable for affordable developers and the ones in .5 districts\nhave higher land values and is the 2.0 a rough guess and how this will work as\nland values continue to increase. She noted that no districts are being\nreferenced and only referencing where the FAR is less than 1.0 assuming that\nthe zoning passes and lasts for a decade or two there is a possibility that\nthe base zoning districts could change and asked if the committee wanted a\nreference to the 1.0 or call out which districts this is about. Councillor\nCarlone stated that every district should have a FAR and be honest about the\nFAR.\n\nMayor McGovern moved suspension of the rules in order to bring forward\nCouncillor Zondervan\u2019s amendment #36 (d).\n\nCouncillor Zondervan moved to amend the recommendation by CDD by substitution\nwith the language in 36 (d) for (a) in section 11.207.5.2.2. The question came\non the motion to amend by substitution and the roll was called and resulted as\nfollows:\n\nYEAS: Councillor Carlone, Vice Mayor Devereux, Councillor Kelley and\nCouncillor\n\nZondervan \\- 4\n\nNAYS: Councillor Mallon, Councillor Simmons, Councillor Toomey and Mayor\n\nMcGovern \\- 4\n\nABSENT: None \\- 0\n\nPRESENT: Councillor Siddiqui \\- 1\n\nAnd the amendment \u2013\n\nFailed.\n\nMayor McGovern proceeded to move adoption of 11.207.5.2.2 residential density\n(a). On an affirmative vote of 9 members the amendment was adopted.\n\nMr. Roberts clarified the language in 11.207.5.2.2. (b). He stated that in the\noriginal version of the petition there was language to the effect that there\nwould be no limitation FAR or lot area per dwelling unit. He explained because\nnow there is a limit on FAR there was the need to move the sentence.\n\nCouncillor Carlone moved adoption of 11.207.5.2.2 (b). On an affirmative vote\nof 9 members the amendment was adopted.\n\nAmendment # 23. An amendment by Councillor Zondervan to amend (a) in Section 6\nParking and Bicycle Parking.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan noted that this was referred to CDD to review the\nlanguage.\n\nMr. Roberts stated that on page 12 of the revised text there is new language\nsuggested to the effect of what the Ordinance Committee voted on. He read the\nrevised text in 11.207.6.1 (a). He stated that the language was cleaner. He\nstated that language was added to 11.207.6.1 (b). He stated that in zoning the\nstandards only apply to parking spaces or loading bays. There are no specific\nstandards for pick up and drop off and deliveries. It was important to\nestablish that the Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department would have a\nrole in certifying that such facilities are being provided in a way that is\nreasonably suited to accommodate that activity in a way that would not cause\nsignificant hazard or congestion and there would be the ability for Traffic\nand Parking to promulgate regulations so that overtime there could be clearer\nstandards put into place for what would constitute appropriate pick up, drop\noff and delivery facilities.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux questioned why there would be either on or off-street\ndeliveries because most of this activity is wanted to be off-street. By\nremoving the obligation to provide actual parking spaces does not mean that\nthere will not be any parking in these projects, but this is a broad thing to\nsay.\n\nMr. Roberts stated that after consultation with Traffic, Parking and\nTransportation stated that things can vary by scale and by existing conditions\nand if it is a small site or small number of units the concern is having the\nability for a small moving van which is routinely handled by Traffic and\nParking by issuing permits to allow for this on a temporary basis.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan moved to amend his amendment by substituting in the\nlanguage suggested by CDD in 11.207.6.1 (a) and (b). On the motion to amend by\nsubstitution on an affirmative vote of 9 members the amendment was adopted.\nThe question now came on adoption of the substituted language in 11.207.6.1\n(a) and (b). On an affirmative vote of 9 members the amended language was\nadopted.\n\nAmendment #23C. An amendment by Vice Mayor Devereux. She stated that this was\ncovered in the memo from CDD on the cost of providing a TPass for a full year.\n\nMr. Roberts stated that there is commentary in the CDD memo under the\nTransportation Demand Management section but is no change to the zoning text.\nHe spoke about the issue of on-going commitments.\n\nMr. Cotter spoke about the perspective of on-going costs and understanding the\nimpact of offering a TPass subsidy would mean to a project in terms of the\nsubsidy and it was found to be significant. He stated that issue as to whether\nor not such a subsidy on an on-going basis might be considered as income was\nreviewed. He stated that under a strict definition of income it would be. He\nstated that at the bottom of page 4 in the memo offered a recommendation to\nmodify the petition text to change the provision of discounted TPasses for\nthree-month duration in the original petition to increase it to six-months.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux commented that what is in the memo did not migrate to the\nrevised text. She moved to amend section 11.207.6.5 Transportation Demand\nManagement in (a) by striking out three- months and substituting in place six-\nmonths. She announced that this only applies to AHO projects that are not\nproviding off-street parking at a ratio of .4 space per dwelling unit or more.\n\nCouncillor Simmons spoke about the impact of the TPass. She asked if the TPass\nwould impact income. Mr. Cotter stated that the definition of income under HUD\nregulations which are applicable to CHA and other housing providers would\nlikely suggest that providing on-going subsidies for a transit pass would be\nconsidered income but do not think that it would rise to be considered income\nif it were provided on a limited or short-term basis.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux moved to amend 11.207.6.5 Transportation Demand Management\nin (a) by striking out three-months. On an affirmative vote of 9 members the\namendment was adopted.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux moved to amend 11.207.6.5 Transportation Demand Management\nin (a) by inserting six-months. On an affirmative vote of 9 members the\namendment was adopted.\n\nCouncillor Carlone now moved that acceptance of 11.207.6.5 Transportation\nDemand Management in (a) as amended. On an affirmative vote of 9 members the\namendment was adopted.\n\nCouncillor Carlone moved a Recess at 2:56 PM.\n\nOn a motion by Councillor Carlone the hearing reconvened at 3:15 PM.\n\nAmendment # 28. To amend 7.3 Building Fa\u00e7ade. This amendment appears in the\nrevised text in 11.207.7.3 (a) and incorporates the recommendations made by\nCouncillor Carlone on the amount of glass in facades going from 15% to 20 % on\nbuilding facades facing a public street. He stated that the average affordable\nhousing is 23% and market rate housing is 28-30%. He stated that for buildings\nlocated in a Business A, Business A-2, Business B or Business C district this\nfigure shall be increased to 30% from 25%.\n\nCouncillor Carlone moved the amendment to 11.207.7.3 (a) by striking out 15%\nand inserting 20%. On an affirmative vote of 8 members the amendment was\nadopted. Councillor Simmons was recorded as present.\n\nCouncillor Carlone moved to amend in the business districts by striking out\n25% and inserting in place 30%.\n\nCouncillor Mallon questioned if this was a recommendation by CDD or was this a\nchange made based on the discussion at the Ordinance Committee. Mr. Roberts\nstated that these were changes voted by the Ordinance Committee. Councillor\nCarlone stated that these were not voted on by the Ordinance Committee but\nwere referred to CDD. He noted that he had written 30% residential and 70%\nactive use on the first floor. There is no comment on this.\n\nMr. Roberts stated that transparent window standards are in the zoning\ndistricts throughout the City to try to promote a street friendly character\nbuilding. He spoke about the overall there is a variation of the windows\nacross the City. He spoke about historic building having a friendly historic\ncharacter the percentage of windows may be 20-25% and is compatible with\nsurrounding area and create a decent streetscape. He stated that the more\nrequirements in place the more limiting it is on design. He stated another\nconcern is if buildings are being expected to be meeting strong energy\nefficiency standards in some cases requiring a large amount of clear windows\ncould work counter to this and may have a negative effect.\n\nMr. Thorkildsen stated that in looking at some example facades there were nice\nfacades with a low percentage of glass but had other architectural details. He\nstated the question about higher percentage ratio on street facades in\nBusiness B etc. districts are a good idea but should check some examples. It\nis not unreasonable to ask for more. Councillor Carlone asked about retail\nfrontage. Mr. Thorkildsen stated that 70% is a reasonable number.\n\nCouncillor Carlone commented that 15% is low and in older buildings the more\nthere is vertical glass windows per people is a friendlier building. He stated\nthat 70% solid is a lot of solid in any room.\n\nMr. Roberts stated that the revised text on page 18 in section (iii) contained\na requirement that the portion containing active non-residential uses would be\nat least 50% transparent glass and based on the Ordinance Committee amendment\nlanguage was incorporated stating that if it is retail or consumer service it\nbe 70% along one street in case of a corner lot. The language was put in for\ngreater clarity. Councillor Carlone stated that the 30% should not include the\nground floor in the calculation; this should be excluded and separate.\n\nCouncillor Carlone moved adoption of the language in the revised text in\n11.207.7.3 (a) by striking out 25% and inserting 30%. On an affirmative vote\nof 9 members the amendment was adopted.\n\nCouncillor Carlone questioned the clarifying revisions by CDD and asked if\nthey need to be adopted. Mr. Roberts stated that in the revised text there are\nsuggested changes made by CDD. There are also clarifying revisions made by\nCDD.\n\nCity Solicitor stated that the intent was to strike the language in 11.207.7.3\n(c) and in addition to recommend adding this language into the Design\nGuidelines. She stated that a vote is required to strike out the language.\nCouncillor Carlone asked if this was added to the Guidelines. Mr. Thorkildsen\nresponded in the affirmative.\n\nCouncillor Carlone moved to strike out in 11.207.7.3 (c) and move this to the\nGuidelines. On an affirmative vote of 9 members this amendment was adopted.\n\nCity Solicitor Glowa, in response to a question by Councillor Carlone, stated\nthat the committee needed to move to substitute the entire document submitted\nby CDD with its various amendments or to vote each clarifying amendment\nseparately.\n\nCouncillor Carlone moved to substitute and replace existing language with the\namended language proposed or distributed by CDD to the entire City Council. No\naction taken.\n\nMayor McGovern suggested that the committee go through the document with the\namendments and vote on these amendments and then act on the revised text by\nCDD.\n\nAmendment #30. Councillor Carlone noted that CDD was to provide the minimum\ndimensions for a two-way driveway.\n\nMr. Roberts stated that the width of driveways is regulated in Article 6 of\nthe Zoning Ordinance. He stated that the minimum width each way for a one-way\ndriveway is 10 feet and a two-way driveway would be 20 feet. Councillor\nCarlone asked if there is a need for a walkway on the side of the driveway.\nThis is contained in the revised text in 11.207.7.4 (b).\n\nMr. Roberts stated that there was discussion at the last Ordinance Committee\nhearing about the amount of space needed for a driveway or a curb cut and is\nin the zoning in Article 6, so this does not need to be specified in the\nzoning. He stated that the maximum in residential districts is 20 feet for\nresidential streets and in other districts the maximum is 30 feet.\n\nCity Solicitor Glowa noted that any contextual change needs to be voted upon\nby the Ordinance Committee. The multicolored document has been what has been\nworked on. The language in the revised text does contain additional language\nchanges and if the City Council wishes to consider the additional changes it\nshould be voted upon at this time while discussing this section or if there is\ninterest by the committee to move all the changes in this document it would be\na different option.\n\nCouncillor Carlone noted that it could be more specific. He remembers it being\nprincipal street on a corner lot. He asked could this be the longer street.\n\nMr. Roberts stated that the one change that was not voted on in this motion.\nHe stated that the request was for CDD to provide the minimum dimension for a\ntwo-way driveway. His understanding of the intent of the 75% of the length of\nthe fa\u00e7ade to exclude the driveway access and that is why this additional\nlanguage is there and would need to be voted on. He stated that his\nrecommendation would be to leave this as it is in the revised text.\n\nCouncillor Carlone moved to accept the language provided by CDD in 11.207.7.4\n(b). On an affirmative vote of 9 members the amendment was adopted.\n\nCity Solicitor Glowa informed the City Council that any textual changes will\nneed to be voted on by the committee. will this undue any of the changes\npreviously made. She added that the committee has been going through the\nmulticolored document which listed a number of changes that were either voted\nupon from the original time that document was made. The revised text, the blue\ndocument is the text of the actual petition with the changes that CDD and with\nthe assistance of the Law Department has reviewed and provided the changes\nthat were explicitly voted upon by the committee or changes that were\nrequested by the committee. The staff was working from the actual petition\nlanguage and this other document is confusing.\n\nCouncillor Simmons asked the City Solicitor if the committee took a vote on\nthe textual changes would this undue or change anything that was not voted on\nup to this point.\n\nMr. Roberts stated that the only change that the committee has voted on today\nthat is not reflected in the revised text is the change regarding the TPass\nsubsidy from three months to six months. The changes that the Ordinance\nCommittee has voted on were changes that were incorporated into the revised\ntext and other clarifying text changes.\n\nCity Solicitor Glowa there is no question of undoing any votes taken. She\nstated that if committee wishes to it could move to adopt all of the proposed\nchanges in the revised text and any changes in the multicolor document that\nwere voted upon today that are not in the revised text these changes can be\ninserted into the revised text so that moving forward there would be one\nintegrated document with changes voted upon.\n\nCouncillor Simmons moved to adopt all the proposed changes in the revised text\nand any changes in the multicolored document that were voted upon today that\nare not in the revised text and that they be inserted into the revised text.\nCouncillor Carlone suggested that this motion be made at the end of the\namendments.\n\nMayor McGovern noted that there are only a few more amendments to go and when\ncompleted CDDs amendment can be moved to be accepted. If this is moved out of\ncommittee today, CDD will produce a clean document of the text.\n\nAmendment #36B. Councillor Zondervan stated that B is about the Net Zero Ready\nwhich was placed on hold pending Article 22 amendments to be submitted to the\nCity Council in September which has a definition of Net Zero Ready. He added\nthat this can be kept on hold or vote to strike this amendment.\n\nMayor McGovern moved to strike in 7.6 (b). The question now came on the\namendment and the roll was called and resulted as follows:\n\nYEAS: Councillor Carlone, Councillor Kelley, Councillor Mallon, Councillor\nSiddiqui, Councillor Simmons, Councillor Toomey and Mayor McGovern \\- 7\n\nNAYS: Councillor Zondervan \\- 1\n\nABSENT: None \\- 0\n\nPRESENT: Vice Mayor Devereux \\- 1\n\nand the amendment to strike out 36B was -\n\nAdopted.\n\nAmendment #36 (c). Councillor Mallon question that the language in the revised\ntext was what was voted on by the committee.\n\nMr. Roberts stated that in the CDD memo there was a request at the last\nOrdinance Committee to study the cost implications which are incorporated into\na section of the CDD memo on tree protection. The language has been\nincorporated on page 20 in 11.207.7.6 (c) intended to be cleaner. He stated\nthat it is funny to state in zoning that the zoning states that these\nrequirements apply from another ordinance is the one that might exempt\nprojects under this overlay from being subject. This is what was incorporated\ninto the draft. Councillor Mallon wanted to ensure that the committee was\nvoting on the CDD language rather than what was presented in the multicolored\ndocument.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux stated that in the CDD language it states it shall comply\nwith the requirements of such ordinance to the extent that it would be\nrequired to comply if not an AHO project. Vice Mayor Devereux asked what other\nprojects do not have to comply with the Tree Ordinance. Mr. Roberts stated\nthat under the zoning ordinance only some projects are required to comply with\nthe provisions of the Tree Protection Ordinance as set forth in the zoning and\nalso in the Tree Protection Ordinance.\n\nCouncillor Simmons commented on the CDD memo on page 5 that states making AHO\nproject subject to the requirements of the Tree Ordinance it will make some\ncost complications. She noted that the whole idea of the AHO was to make it\neasier or facilitate the building of affordable housing units. She will vote\npresent because it may complicate the AHO and adds a small obstacle in this\nprocess. The intent was to clear or make easier the path and this does not do\nthis.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan suggested amendment the CDD language by striking out AHO\nand inserting in place affordable housing project because it may make it\nclearer.\n\nCity Solicitor Glowa stated that the Tree Protection Ordinance does not apply\nto afford housing projects and this language was intended to make it clear\nthat AHO projects would be exempt from the requirements of the Tree Protection\nOrdinance.\n\nCouncillor Simmons asked does this make it more difficult for developers under\nthe AHO.\n\nMr. Cotter stated that it does make it more complicated to comply with the\nTree Protection Ordinance. He stated that adding any requirement does make\nthings more complicated from the standpoint of a housing development provider.\nThis amendment would eliminate the exemption.\n\nCouncillor Simmons stated that this provides a restriction even though well\nintended and she would be inclined not to support this amendment.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan moved his amendment to strike out AHO and insert\naffordable housing project and then substitute the revised text language for\nhis original amendment. On a voice vote of 8 members the amendment was\nadopted. Councillor Simmons was recorded as present.\n\nThe question now came on the motion to substitute the amended revised text for\nhis amendment to the original petition. On this question the roll was called\nand resulted as follows:\n\nYEAS: Councillor Carlone, Vice Mayor Devereux, Councillor Kelley, Councillor\nMallon, Councillor Siddiqui, Councillor Zondervan and Mayor McGovern \\- 7\n\nNAYS: Councillor Simmons \\- 1\n\nABSENT: None \\- 0\n\nPRESENT: Councillor Toomey \\- 1\n\nand the amendment was \u2013\n\nAdopted.\n\nCouncillor Carlone now moved that the 11.207.7.6 (c) be amended to strike out\nAHO an insert the words affordable housing project. On an affirmative vote of\n9 members the amendment was adopted.\n\nAmendment #36A. Councillor Mallon asked is ISD able to decide based on whether\nthis is fully shielded.\n\nCity Solicitor Glowa stated that shielded may be more appropriate than fully-\nshielded. She stated that she will look at existing language, confer with the\nCommissioner of Inspectional Services and report back to the committee at the\nnext meeting.\n\nCouncillor Mallon wanted fully shielded kept.\n\nAmendment #41 Overlay Design Consultation Objectives.\n\nCouncillor Carlone wanted to state the objectives clearly.\n\nCity Solicitor Glowa stated that one of the sensitivities here is the\nappealability of any. In this case this case the requirement for a Special\nPermit has been removed but a developer of an AHO project would still need a\nbuilding permit and building permits are appealable. By having language that\nis more subjective or qualitative as opposed to quantitative requirements\nthere is the possibility that this could open the City or developer up to\nhaving a building permit appealed on the basis that there are some unclear\nstandards here in the zoning ordinance. An opponent of the project could state\nthat they did not meet the requirements. So, the recommendation was to move\nthese into the Design Guidelines so that they are guiding the process for the\nconsultation that will occur with the Planning Board of Design Review but not\nbe mandatory requirements that would need to be met in order to obtain a\nbuilding permit because this could create some additional legal hurtles.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that he does not see why this cannot be a guide to\nthe Planning Board in their evaluations. He has concern with non-binding\nreview by the City.\n\nMayor McGovern stated that there is vagueness and leaves it open to\ninterpretation. He likes the guidance and if it goes in the zoning it is\nharder to assess. This should be in the guidelines and not in zoning.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that the Planning Board would use this as an\nevaluation of whether or not it meets the intent. He noted that the Guidelines\nmean nothing.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux asked how the Design Guidelines get promulgated or voted\nupon. Councillor Carlone stated that he feels that guidelines should be voted\nupon. Vice Mayor Devereux commented that CDD does not want to put guideline in\nzoning and how is guidelines implemented.\n\nCity Solicitor Glowa stated that in the revised text in 11.207.9 the City\nManager has authority to promulgate regulations and Design Guidelines was\nadded to CDD.\n\nCouncillor Mallon spoke about changes to the Guidelines, one of which was a\npre-designed analysis of the character of the street was a change in the\ndesign guidelines. Mr. Thorkildsen stated that Pre-design analysis of the\ncharacter of the street was incorporated in a section in the guideline\nincludes the language on page 7 and page 10. Councillor Mallon stated that CDD\nwill have input based on the design guidelines as set forth in this document\nand intended to be complied with.\n\nCouncillor Carlone asked who is responsible for doing the analysis of the\ncontext of the street. Mr. Thorkildsen responded the proponent. Councillor\nCarlone asked who will review this.  Mr. Thorkildsen stated that it is the\nbasis of the community meetings and the Planning Board\u2019s review and the\nAffordable Housing Trust\u2019s review.\n\nMr. Roberts stated that one of the changes made in the CDD text to add an\nadditional required community meeting to the process to share the site and\nstreet context analysis with the residents and other interested parties prior\nto building design and to receive feedback.\n\nCouncillor Carlone asked what binds the developer to follow this. Mr. Cotter\nstated that given the economics of this builders will be building with subsidy\nfunds or coming to the Affordable Housing Trust. He stated that having a\nreport from the Planning Board and staff to the Affordable Housing Trust on\nthe design advisory review and the process that the project went through with\nthe neighbors. With this it is expected that the objectives will be achieved.\n\nOn a motion to move Amendment #41 to the guidelines on an affirmative vote of\n9 members the motion was adopted.\n\nAmendments #42-43 and 43A. Councillor Mallon stated that in the revised text\nCDD has taken the essence of the conversation of the three amendments\ntogether. Councillor Carlone moved that the three proposed amendments #42, 43\nand 43A be removed. On a voice vote of 9 members the amendment was adopted.\n\nCouncillor Carlone moved to substitute the text from CDD in 11.207.11 (a) and\n(b) Review of Affordable Housing Overlay.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux commented on the Five-Year Progress Review. She asked\nshould the Planning Board be involved in a five-year review. Mr. Roberts\nstated that if it is the will of the committee to add this language it could\nbe added. Vice Mayor Devereux moved to amend section (b) to add after Council,\nthe Planning Board.\n\nCouncillor Simmons asked Mr. Cotter if the Planning Board reviews housing\npolicy. Mr. Cotter responded that the Planning Board will review housing\npolicies that intersect with zoning. Vice Mayor Devereux noted that this is\nzoning. Councillor Carlone noted that CDD is staff to the Planning Board. Mr.\nCotter stated that he would like to share the report with the Planning Board\nand the Affordable Housing Trust. Councillor Simmons moved to amend to add the\nAffordable Housing Trust.\n\nMayor McGovern stated that there is a difference between sharing a report or\nbeing part of the evaluation. This should be done after CDD does evaluation.\nHe will vote to share the evaluation with the Planning Board and the\nAffordable Housing Trist and not be part of the evaluation.\n\nOn the motion to amend by Vice Mayor Devereux to add the Planning Board. On an\naffirmative vote of 9 members the amendment was adopted.\n\nOn the motion to amend by Councillor Simmons to add the Affordable Housing\nTrust. On an affirmative vote of 9 members the amendment was adopted.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux further amended this section to add words \u201cfor its review\u201d\nafter the word \u201cprovide\u201d. On an affirmative vote of 9 members the amendment\nwas adopted.\n\nOn adoption of the entire 11.207.11 and (b) as amended. On an affirmative vote\nof 9 members the section as amended was adopted.\n\nCouncillor Kelley moved to amend section 11.207.2 to add a new (c) that reads:\n\n(c) An AHO project shall not be permitted on any property whose units are\nalready no more than 100% of AMI.\n\nHe explained his amendment. The housing project are not under 1.0 FAR and\nlimited to a 2.0 FAR and\n\nmay never be redeveloped.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan stated is this stating that this should not apply to\nthose already providing affordable housing.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that Councillor Kelley\u2019s amendment is to consider\nnot allowing this to happen where there is existing reasonable density, low-\nmoderate income housing.\n\nCouncillor Kelley stated that if the AHO passes as currently written there may\nbe incentives such as redeveloping existing affordable housing developments\nbecause this may be the most cost-effective way to get more affordable\nhousing.\n\nCouncillor Siddiqui stated that she is not comfortable voting on the\nsubstantive amendment. At Roosevelt towers is undergoing renovations and it is\nnot to increase units. She will not support this amendment.\n\nCouncillor Simmons stated that this would prevent an existing affordable\nhousing developer from increasing density. Councillor Kelley stated that the\nAHO as proposed may provide incentives that are difficult to ignore; this may\nnot happen, but it is a possibility. Councillor Simmons stated that she would\nnot support this amendment.\n\nCouncillor Toomey stated that he would not vote in favor of this amendment.\n\nThe question now came on the amendment offered by Councillor Kelley the roll\nwas called and resulted as follows:\n\nYEAS: Councillor Kelley \\- 1\n\nNAYS: Councillor Carlone, Vice Mayor Devereux, Councillor Mallon, Councillor\nSiddiqui, Councillor Simmons, Councillor Toomey, Councillor Zondervan and\n\nMayor McGovern \\- 8\n\nABSENT: None \\- 0\n\nand the amendment \u2013\n\nFailed.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux commented on Open space in 11.207.5.2.4 (a). She stated\nthat the open space can be reduced to 15% regarding historic preservation. She\nasked how necessary this is and why cut the open space in half in exchange for\nprotecting historic projects. She noted that when this was originally drafted\nall of the open space had to be at ground level and subsequently the committee\nvoted to allow 25% of the open space to be above ground if a common roof deck\nor balcony. She noted that this is not a good idea.\n\nShe stated that in section (b) exempting AHO projects from the requirement\nthat is in the rest of the zoning which some of the open space has to be in a\nconfiguration of a 15 X 15 space which is eliminated and without this it means\nthat the open space can be met. She wanted to see a site plan to see how this\nworks and not eliminating so much usable open space that we have no place to\nplant trees.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan questioned why just completely exempt an historical\nbuilding or reduce by 50% because it is a historic building.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that the rationale is the historic buildings 2.5\nstories high and the rest is 4 stories the units above are missing or you\ncannot build right up to the historic building on the side.\n\nMayor McGovern commented that there is no formal amendment.\n\nMayor McGovern moved to substitute the entirety of the AHO language as\nintroduced with amendments offered by CDD except as they might conflict with\nactions taken on September 3, 2019. On an affirmative vote of 9 members the\nmotion carried.\n\nMayor McGovern moved to forward the AHO ordinance as amended to the full City\nCouncil with a favorable recommendation. On this motion the roll was called\nand resulted as follows:\n\nYEAS: Councillor Mallon, Councillor Siddiqui, Councillor Simmons, Councillor\nToomey and Mayor McGovern \\- 5\n\nNAYS: Councillor Carlone, Vice Mayor Devereux, Councillor Kelley and\nCouncillor\n\nZondervan \\- 4\n\nABSENT: None \\- 0\n\nAnd the motion \u2013\n\nCarried.\n\nThe following communications relating to the AHOD were received and made part\nof the record.\n\nCommunication from Sharon Stichter, Walden Street, urging the City Council not\nto pass this ordinance (ATTACHMENT 53).\n\nCommunication from Nelly LaRosa-waters, 54 Crescent Street, in agreement with\nall the opposition to this petition (ATTACHMENT 54).\n\nCommunication from Lynn Cetrulo against the AHO plan as it stands (ATTACHMENT\n55).\n\nCommunication from Eleanor Marsh, 609 Green Street, requesting that affordable\nhousing is clearly defined for low, moderate and middle income households\n(ATTACHMENT 56).\n\nCommunication from Ron Jackson, 14 Camp Street, expressed concern with\ndensity, parking, larger construction projects, traffic, green/open space and\nmaintenance regarding the AHOD (ATTACHMENT 57).\n\nCommunication from Dean Traweek, 12 Brattle Circle, in opposition to the AHOD\nproposal (ATTACHMENT 58).\n\nCommunication from James Simpson, 24307 Concord Avenue, expressing strong\ndisapproval with the petition (ATTACHMENT 59).\n\nCommunication from Tom and Sue Owen, 950 Massachusetts Avenue, in opposition\nto the current AHO plan (ATTACHMENT 60).\n\nCommunication from Bill Skocpol, 66 Huron Avenue, stating that \u201cas of right\u201d\nabandonment of all zoning regulations will destroy the City (ATTACHMENT 61).\n\nCommunication from Richard Tremaglio, 36 Tierney Street, commenting that the\ncurrent proposal is not sensitive to the unique urban fabric of Cambridge\n(ATTACHMENT 62).\n\nCommunication from Jacqueline Landau, Ph.D., 950 Massachusetts Avenue,\ncommenting that this petition has not been done democratically and urging the\nCity Council not to rush through this (ATTACHMENT 63).\n\nCommunication from Carolyn Shipley, 15 Laurel Street, commenting that much is\nwrong with this proposed zoning (ATTACHMENT 64).\n\nCommunication from George Mouradian, 32 Bowdoin Street, stated that he\nsupports affordable housing but finds that the AHO is deeply flawed\n(ATTACHMENT 65).\n\nCommunication from Sharon Black, 49 Maple Avenue, urging the City Council not\nto vote for the AHO zoning proposal (ATTACHMENT 66).\n\nCommunication from Dominick Jones, 6 Hurlbut Street, commenting that the AHO\nis a dangerous one-sided shamble being currently proposed (ATTACHMENT 67).\n\nCommunication from Kate Canfield expressing deep concerns over the AHO\nproposal (ATTACHMENT 68).\n\nCommunication from William and Miriam Truslow, 4 Hawthorn Street, commenting\nthat the AHO is a blunt instrument that will irreparably damage the City\n(ATTACHMENT 69).\n\nCommunication from John and Hilary Hopkins, 30 Winslow Street, in opposition\nto the zoning proposal (ATTACHMENT 70).\n\nCommunication from Lucy Patton, 333 Walden Street, commenting that the AHO as\ncurrently written is not a good idea (ATTACHMENT 71).\n\nCommunication highlighting comments made by Cheryl-Ann Pizza-Zeoli in strong\nsupport of the Affordable Housing Overlay (ATTACHMENT 72).\n\nCommunication from Annie Hoffman, Hampshire Street, in opposition to the AHO\nzoning proposal (ATTACHMENT 73).\n\nCommunication from Lenore G.

These funds were received in FY15 and the revenue\nfell to free cash pending an appropriation of the funds which is now being\nrecommended.\n\nThese funds have been received by the City from Encore and would be used to\ncover the cost of acquiring traffic monitoring units to be installed at\nmultiple intersections in Cambridge that we expect will be impacted by the\nopening of the new casino. These monitoring units will allow us to measure the\nuser volumes at these intersections both before and after the casino opens,\nallowing us to understand the impact that the casino is having on traffic\nvolumes at key locations in the city. In addition to providing a basis for\nimplementing signal timing changes and other mitigation measures, the data\ncollected by these monitoring devices may also provide data that would justify\nseeking additional mitigation funding through the Massachusetts Gaming\nCommission. Due to the timing of the opening of the Encore Casino, we are\nseeking to procure and install these cameras by June of this year.\n\nThe proposed traffic detection units each consist of a 360-degree video camera\ndevice which is mounted approximately 10 feet above one of the traffic signal\nmast arms at an intersection, in a location that allows visibility towards all\napproaches to the intersection. The camera communicates a video feed via the\nhardwired signal conduit to the signal control cabinet at the intersection,\nwhere a new video processing unit is installed. The video processing unit\nanalyzes the video feed on-site in order to count and classify roadway users\napproaching the intersection by their transportation mode type.\n\nThe processed data collected will be used for two purposes:\n\n\u2022 Traffic detection: this process provides a notification to the traffic\nsignal controller requesting to call or extend a signal phase to allow for\ndynamic signal phasing that adapts to changes in the number of roadway users\npresent.\n\n\u2022 Traffic counts: providing continuous counts of roadway users traveling\nthrough the intersection. Counts are broken out by movement (i.e., direction\nof approach and turn or straight movement through the intersection) and by\ntransportation mode type (i.e., truck, bus, vehicle, bicycle, pedestrian).\n\nThese units are exempt from the Surveillance Technology Ordinance (the\n\u201cOrdinance\u201d), since Surveillance Technology as defined in the Ordinance does\nnot apply to technology that is not capable of collecting, capturing, or\nrecording information specifically associated with or capable of being\nassociated with any Identifiable Individual or group. Furthermore, the\ndefinition of Surveillance Technology in the Ordinance does not include\n\u201csurveillance devices that cannot record or transmit audio or video or be\nremotely accessed.\u201d (See Section 2.128.020(G)(2)(d) of the Ordinance).\n\n"

Lopez.\n\nAlso present were Nels Frye, 40 Sherman Street, Carol O\u2019Hare, 172 Magazine\nStreet, Lee Farris, 269 Norfolk Street and Patrick Barrett, 41 Pleasant\nStreet.\n\nCouncillor Carlone convened the hearing and stated the purpose. He announced\nthat the hearing was being audio and video recorded. He outlined the format of\nthe hearing, petitioner, City staff, City Council clarification comments,\npublic comment and comments by the committee and a conclusion may be made.\n\nCouncillor Kelley gave the background for the impetus of the petition. He\nstated that his friend did not have the appropriate lot size and other\ndimensional requirements to get an accessory dwelling unit, so he decided to\nseek a variance. He stated that the variance process required an attorney and\ndelayed the project and had a financial implication. He stated that the\nexisting Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) zoning ordinance could be fixed\nrelating to the requirement for a variance. He stated that it is hard to\nestimate how many people need to get a variance for an ADU. The way that the\nBoard of Zoning Appeals cases are filed does not allow for an accurate data\nsearch. It is impossible to get the number for those who apply for a variance.\n\nHe gave a PowerPoint presentation (ATTACHMENT B). Councillor Kelly stated that\nthe basic regulatory program already exists in section 4.22 of the Zoning\nOrdinance created in the l970s and updated within the last few years. The City\nwants people to have ADU, but the method does not work perfectly. The City\nwants to create more housing opportunities without creating new and bigger\nbuildings. He stated that the basic theme of an ADU is it has the footprint\nand the size of an existing building and figure out how to turn it into\nanother dwelling unit. He stated that pre-existing garages being used for an\nADU is a sticking point. In this proposal pre-existing separate structures\nwould only be a garage.\n\nThe Planning Board was concerned with. It seems arbitrary to pick a date and\nstate that an ADU should be done before a specific date. He stated that Short\nTerm Rental discussion is continuing and on a separate track rather than be\nlumped into this petition. He stated that the start date is irrelevant to\noperations\n\nHe highlighted the intent of the proposed amendment is to allow individuals to\ncreate ADU. This is not to suggest houses get higher, but a basement apartment\nmay end up changing the mean grade of the housing by putting in an egress for\nthe basement. He stated that to allow existing unmodified free-standing\nstructures like garages to be used as ADU, get rid of parking requirements and\nlot size requirements as they impact ADU and eliminate height requirement for\nbasement egress and entrance. He noted that there may be setback concerns. He\nstated that the proposed amendment would eliminate these concerns. He stated\nthat this may increase the value of property. The language was clarified for\nexisting garages rather than a garage being built then used as an ADU. This\nwould only be used for single- and two-family homes. He stated that detached\nADUs might negatively impact the neighbor\u2019s privacy.\n\nHe stated that there is still a need for Special Permits and the Planning\nBoard can impose conditions to respect the look, feel, character and privacy\nof a neighborhood. He submitted a proposed amendment as a substitution in a\nmemorandum dated April 1, 2019 (ATTACHMENT C). Councillor Kelley\u2019s motion to\namend by substitution was the document labeled ADU Language - Clean. He stated\nthat this captures the concerns of the Planning Board. The question now came\non the amendment by substitution of the previous zoning proposal - and on a\nvoice vote the motion to amend by substitution carried on a voice vote of\nseven members.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that the Planning Board discussed this petition last\nweek and there is no Planning Board report yet. He stated that in the future\nthe Ordinance Committee would like to schedule hearings once there is a\nPlanning Board written report to get a full representation of the hearing.\n\nMr. Roberts spoke about the timeline. He stated that Planning Board first\nhearing the petition on January 22, 2019 and a recommendation was sent to the\nCity Council on March 4, 2019 (ATTACHMENT D). He stated that the following\nweek the Ordinance Committee held a hearing and questions were raised and a\nsubstituted version was submitted. He stated that one of the key\nrecommendations of the Planning Board at the first hearing was their interest\nin having City staff carefully review the language to make sure that it was\nclear what the intent was and how the intent would be manifested in the\napplication of the zoning language. The members of the Planning Board\nexpressed concerns whether it would be clear enough in stating what the\ndifferent rights and requirements of an accessory apartment would be under the\nproposal. The Planning Board supported the petition at a substantive level but\nfelt that staff should review it.\n\nMr. Roberts stated that after the Planning Board hearing the Community\nDevelopment Department discussed the petition internally. He stated that one\nof the suggestions that was to have the Planning Board look at the revised\nversion of the petition text, text reviewed by the Ordinance Committee on\nFebruary 2, 2019, and decide if the Board wanted to make any adjustments to\nthe Planning Board recommendations. This is what was reviewed by the Planning\nBoard at its meeting on Tuesday along with additional material compiled by\nstaff. He stated that at the last Planning Board hearing revisions were made\nto the Planning Board recommendations that will be communicated to the City\nCouncil in a report. He noted that many of the comments by the Planning Board\nwere the same as the previous report.\n\nHe stated that the Planning Board felt that it is important that staff look at\nlanguage carefully and make sure that it can be applied clearly for cases that\ngo before the BZA for Special Permits. Councillor Carlone stated that no\nformal approval should occur until the Planning Board recommendations are\nreceived and discussed. He asked if this would go back to Planning Board or is\nit in the hands of the staff for review. Mr. Roberts responded that regarding\nthe timing of the petition it may be difficult for this to go back to the\nPlanning Board for review. He stated that when the Planning Board votes a\nrecommendation generally it is left in the hands of staff, but it was\nimportant for the Planning Board to be clear about what version of the\npetition they were reviewing and that the language needed more careful review\nby staff before moving forward. Mr. Roberts stated that the Planning Board\nsupported petition in content and had concerns with modifications to the\npetition.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux asked about the language that was just substituted. She\nasked Councillor Kelley if he made the redline changes after the hearing last\nweek by the Planning Board. Councillor Kelley responded in the affirmative.\nVice Mayor Devereux spoke about the language matching others portions of the\nzoning ordinance so that the same terms were being used consistently she was\nunclear about this.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan asked what it means to get rid of the lot size\nrequirements that impact the ADU; what are the implications. Councillor Kelley\nstated that under the zoning code a specific lot size is needed to have a\ncertain number of units. He stated that if a unit is added to a lot size that\nis too small to have that number of units more lot size would be needed for\nthe ADU. He stated that the theme is that the ADU does not change the outside\nof a building significantly. He spoke about what would be covered by a Special\nPermit application. There is no relief needed for the lot size needed.\nCouncillor Zondervan ask why there needs to be special rules for an ADU. If a\ncertain level of density of dwelling units is good, then why not have this\ntrue across the board and why is there a need for special rules for adding a\ndwelling unit to an existing building if in compliance with the zoning\nordinance. Councillor Kelley stated the ADU is for existing structures only.\nCouncillor Zondervan asked why only get rid of parking requirement for ADU and\nnot across the board. Councillor Kelley stated that they could be eliminated\nacross the board, but this was intended to be a narrow fix to a small part of\nthe zoning ordinance and has turned into a larger discussion on ADUs. He\nwanted to have the parking discussion at a different time than during this\nparticular petition. He stated that zoning is a challenging tool and difficult\nto go through this process for a small change.\n\nCouncillor Mallon agreed with the Planning Board that staff needs to look at\nlanguage to ensure that it conforms with the zoning ordinance. She is curious\naround the timing of this petition. She asked when the Community Development\nDepartment staff will come back to the Ordinance Committee with the language.\nMr. Roberts stated that the staff can provide language and send it back to the\nCity Council but that the petition expires in the beginning of May. He stated\nthat within this time the staff can review the language and come back to the\nCity Council with the language. There is no fixed time line. Councillor Mallon\nasked whether there be enough time to receive the language, hold another\nOrdinance Committee hearing and be able to ordain this amendment before the\npetition expires. Councillor Carlone responded that there is not enough time\nand will need to be discussed at the end of the hearing.\n\nCouncillor Carlone opened public comment at 2:37 PM.\n\nNels Frye, 40 Sherman Street, stated that he would like to build an ADU and\nconvert part of an existing structure into an ADU so that when he returns he\ndoes not have to live with his mother. There is a garden which was part of the\nSecret Garden tour in 2018 to benefit the public library that had 150 visitors\nin the garden. He stated that the carrying costs for the property are high, so\nit is rented. The goal would be to add an ADU for his mother to live in. This\nwould allow increased housing by allowing ADU without going before BZA. He\nstated that the mortgage and property taxes are too expensive and to recover\nthe cost building a studio would help the financing.\n\nCarol O\u2019Hare, 172 Magazine Street, stated that she is not talking about\nsubstance; she is talking about process. She commented to not let the perfect\nbe the enemy of the good. She stated let the (near) perfect be the enemy of\nthe good. The Planning Board, the Community Development Department and the Law\nDepartment are skilled employees and there is no reason for this \u201cprocess.\u201d\nShe stated that process is important and the definitions are not tied down.\nThere is no reason to make the zoning ordinance more complicated than it is\nnow. There are four different versions floating around for this petition. She\nhas lost track of this petition. She urged the Ordinance Committee to please\nfix this and let it fly when fixed.\n\nLee Farris, 269 Norfolk St., stated that she just saw redline version\nsubmitted by Councillor Kelley. She wanted Councillor Kelley to go through the\nchanges and his reasons and therefore she has no comments on this. She does\nnot have a basis to comment.\n\nPatrick Barrett, 41 Pleasant Street, stated that he wrote the original ADU\namendment to the ordinance based on feedback from community and from the state\nthat outlined how they wanted ADU meted out across other municipalities. At\nthe time of the first Planning Board hearing there was a question raised - is\nthere is definition of basement in the ordinance. He stated that the answer is\nno, but in Article II where a definition does not exist you look to the\nBuilding Code, which does contain a robust definition. He stated that there is\naccessory building definition in the zoning, but no definition of accessory\nstructure. The Building Code does contain a definition, and this is something\nthat the Planning Board knows as well as the Law Department. He stated that\nwhen there are gaps understanding how these words are meted out and the\nordinance is ripe with this. He stated that dwelling unit is categorized as\ndifferent thing.\n\nHe added that there are inconsistencies throughout the ordinance. He stated\nthat the height of a building is measured by the mean grade and this is\naltered when you add a window well and need a variance. This is what is going\non at the Inspectional Services Department. He stated that ADUs lot size and\nlot per dwelling were confused. He stated that if the variance is removed it\ndoes not alter the requirement. This is zoning change - to make a small change\nto Article IV. He stated that the intent of this proposal was outlined by the\nfirst speaker. It is not easy to get a variance at the BZA. The small changes\nbecome a quality of life issue for people.\n\nCouncillor Carlone closed public committee at 2:52 PM.\n\nCouncillor Carlone opened discussion on the issue. He does not question the\nsubstance of the changes made by Councillor Kelley but clearly city staff will\nreview language and get back to the City Council.\n\nCouncillor Kelley stated that he wanted this kept in committee and reported\nout to the full City Council. He stated that from a process standpoint he\ntried to incorporate the Ordinance Committee and the Planning Board changes.\nHe is doing his best to get changes before the City Council before voting on\nit. The Planning Board had a less understanding of the goal of the proposal\nand these are better addressed in this version. He stated that there are a\nvariety of inconsistencies in the existing zoning ordinance.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux stated that the memo from Community Development Department\ndated March 21, 2019 54.00 contained a chart that included the summaries of\nBZA accessory apartment cases between 2016-2018. The chart shows five cases\nand one applicant withdrew. She stated that three of the four that went\nthrough the process needed variances; two of which were for having a lot size\nless than 5,000 square feet. She asked Councillor Kelley about his comment\nthat the Planning Board wanted to review and noted that the Special Permits\nwill be granted by BZA not the Planning Board. She asked if there is a record\nof Special Permits that the BZA granted for ADU that did not require a\nvariance.\n\nMr. Roberts stated that he did a quick scan of BZA agendas for the past two\nyears for ADU, including ADU cases that came before the BZA and the majority\nof the cases did need a variance in addition to the Special Permit for the\nADU. He stated that the chart contains the extent of the cases for ADU found\non BZA agendas.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux stated that only one of the five required no other relief\nand received a Special Permit. She commented that when the ADU zoning was\napproved it was thought that there would be 1,000 units created out of this.\nShe added it is strange that no one did an ADU even without needing a\nvariance. Councillor Carlone stated that having gone through the variance\nprocess - it requires significant work and he cannot image most people\nconsidering this. He spoke about this path being faster to add ADUs maybe the\npath is not an indication of the future.\n\nCouncillor Siddiqui stated that five people were interested and suggested\ndoing an ADU 101 to let people know that ADU is available and what it can do.\nThere needs more education on this. An outreach plan is needed.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan stated that he is struggling with the bigger question and\nunderstands it is important to simplify this section. He asked why special\nzoning is needed to allow people to build a unit in their existing building if\nit is compliant with the Building Code. Why would the City get involved at\nall, he asked? This would allow higher density in existing structures than in\nnew structures. He spoke about simplifying zoning overall. He stated that this\nseems to be making the problem worse by creating further inconsistencies. He\nspoke about simplifying the zoning overall so that there are not so many\ninconsistencies.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated this is reusing existing structures in a more\nefficient way and if a person can add a second parking space in a single-\nfamily house, they will because they can charge for it. New unit sizes are\nsmaller than older, existing structures. Councillor Zondervan stated that the\nzoning ordinance should be more consistent. There should not be different\nrules for existing structures that allow more units than for new structures.\nCouncillor Carlone stated that this is looking at 1-2 family structures. He\nstated that this is looking at the reservoir of existing structures, many of\nwhich are large. He stated that broader zoning changes will literally take\nyears for resolution.\n\nCouncillor Mallon stated that Councillor Kelley\u2019s memo stated that this is not\nan attempt to address large inconsistencies in the zoning ordinance. She\nstated that having a conversation about the large zoning ordinance is not a\ngood idea. She asked for clarification that this zoning amendment was to\naddress accessory structures and the ability to build ADU in accessory\nstructures, which was not allowed in the previous amendment. Councillor Kelley\nresponded that currently this cannot be done, and the thought would be if one\nhad an accessory structure, defined in the International Building Code, that\nwould be if the other conditions are met it could be turned into an ADU.\nCouncillor Mallon stated that she does not have 900 square feet in her house\nbut does have an existing garage for an ADU. She added that this amendment may\nopen the ability for more ADU to be built which is the goal.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux stated that on the chart two of the examples were new\nconstruction of single-family homes. She asked can a single family be built\nwith an ADU. Is this really saying that only existing structures can have an\nADU. Councillor Carlone stated that new construction would need to go for a\nvariance.\n\nCity Solicitor Glowa stated that over the last several years there has been an\ninterest in defining certain accessory units, as being somehow distinct from\nwhat otherwise would be considered a two-family. A two-family does not relate\ntypically to a traditional zoning context or in most zoning cases that talk\nabout zoning ordinances, it does not matter whether it is the same size as the\nlarger units, or whether it is a so-called in-law unit or an accessory unit.\nShe stated that if Residence A allows for 2 families then you can have an in-\nlaw unit in your large house. She added that these definitions have been\nshifting over the last few years as people have been working to create\nexceptions for or allowances for re-use of some aspects of building to\naccommodate these various types of accessory uses as part of existing\nstructure. So, the basement unit change was one of the changes to\ndifferentiate between ADU and a two-family. This is confusing and could use\nclarification. She stated that a dwelling unit is a dwelling unit and whether\nit is called an ADU you are allowing another dwelling unit in a structure or\nif allowing another dwelling unit on a parcel such as a garage on a parcel\nthis also is another dwelling unit. She added that this needs to be reconciled\nto make it more understandable to people.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan said it is important to have this conversation in the\ncontext of the overall zoning ordinance. He stated that he is highlighting\nthis issue and if the zoning gets finer in the weeds of certain sections it\ngets more confusing and at some point, it makes sense to go back and look at\nthe whole thing. He stated that if it makes sense to allow higher density of\ndwelling units whether it is an existing or new structure then maybe the\nentire zoning ordinance needs to be reviewed to get the same level of density\neverywhere. He spoke again about enforcement and if it complies with Building\nCode why do we have to get involved. He stated that there are better ways to\naccomplish these goals.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that he has been involved with this City for 45\nyears and 45 years ago it was said that the zoning code needed to be\nsimplified and updated. He stated that having the Building Code be the basis\nis insufficient. The Zoning Code and the Building Code work together to create\na safe and sensible city of buildings.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux stated that to make this clear she moved to amend 4.22.1\nby adding after the words \u201calteration of\u201d the words \u201c\u201dan existing\u201d (ATTACHMENT\nE). Councillor Kelley stated that if this will make it read better to people\nand it is clearer it is a great idea.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that all zoning goes through Community Development\nand the Law Department and this is what is being asked for this petition. He\nstated that Mr. Roberts and Ms. Glowa have not had time to look at the current\nversion and their input is needed.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux now moved her amendment- and on a voice vote of six\nmembers the amendment -\n\nCarried.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that given the timing of the petition this could be\nordained by May 6th if submitted to the full City Council based on getting a\nrefined and approved version from the City staff and the proposal could be\nmoved to a second reading on April 22, 2019.\n\nCouncillor Carlone moved the petition as amended by substitution by Councillor\nKelley and further amended by Vice Mayor Devereux be referred to the full City\nCouncil with a favorable recommendation based on getting a refined text from\nCity staff. The motion carried on a voice vote of six members.\n\nCouncillor Carlone and Councillor Kelley thanked all those present for their\nattendance.\n\nThe hearing adjourned at 3:17 PM\n\nFor the Committee,\n\n__________________________________\n\nCouncillor Dennis J. Carlone, Co-Chair\n\nCouncillor Craig Kelley, Co-Chair\n\nOrdinance Committee\n\n"

Mallon\n\nMayor Marc C. McGovern\n\nCouncillor Sumbul Siddiqui\n\nCouncillor Timothy J. Toomey, Jr.\n\nCouncillor E. Denise Simmons\n\nCouncillor Quinton Y. Zondervan\n\n|\n\nIn City Council April 8, 2019  \n  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Ordinance Committee, comprised of the entire membership of the City\nCouncil, held a public hearing on March 27, 2019 at 3:03 PM in the Sullivan\nChamber.\n\nThe purpose of the hearing was to discuss a zoning petition filed by Melissa\nand Christopher Grippo et al to amend the Zoning Ordinance by adding at the\nend of section 5.30.11 a sentence that reads: \u201cnotwithstanding the foregoing,\nin Industry B District, a hotel use (Section 4.31.2) shall be governed by the\nsection number (4.0) for purposes of determining the maximum ratio of floor\narea to lot area (ATTACHMENT A).\n\nPresent at the hearing were Councillor Carlone Co-Chair of the Committee,\n\nCouncillor Mallon, Councillor Siddiqui, Councillor Zondervan, Arthur Goldberg,\nDeputy City Solicitor, Director of Zoning and Development Jeff Roberts, CDD\nand City Clerk Donna P. Lopez.\n\nAlso present were Attorney Patrick Barrett, Mark Boyes-Watson, Hassanaly\nLadha, 34-40 Hampshire Street LLC and John Hawkinson.\n\nCouncillor Carlone convened the hearing and stated the purpose. He announced\nthat the hearing was being audio and video recorded both publicly and\nprivately. He outlined the format of the hearing. The petitioners would be\nheard first, followed by city staff and the Planning Board, then the City\nCouncil would discuss, followed by public comment and finally the City Council\nwould conclude with a discussion.\n\nAttorney Patrick Barrett, representing the petitioners, gave a PowerPoint\nPresentation (ATTACHMENT B). He stated his presentation includes a parcel\nowned by Mr. Ladha in the IB district. He explained that the presentation\nwould show what could possibly be built and what the intent is. In 2001 a\ncitywide rezoning of the Industrial-B district hotel use was reduced to 2.75\nFAR as a means to incentivize residential construction. Barrett noted that no\nresidential building has occurred in this district in past 20 years. However,\nthere have been three large commercial developments, all of which have been\napproved above the 4.0 FAR. He also noted a sub-area in IB allows a 3.2 FAR\nspecifically for larger commercial buildings.\n\nMr. Barrett stated that the hotel use is still listed in the Table of Uses as\na residential use, but it still cannot obtain the higher residential FAR of\n4.0. He showed the area of the IB District before 2001 and after the rezoning\nof 2001. The petitioners own a lot in the district and want to build a small\nindependent hotel. However, under the current FAR of 2.75 zoning this is\nextremely difficult. He stated that the up zoning petition received a\nfavorable recommendation by the Planning Board.\n\nBarrett stated that residential development in this district is complicated\ngiven the large commercial/industrial buildings that surround it on three\nsides. Since the site also abuts the residential neighborhood, a hotel use is\nthe best way to connect the two use areas. He informed the committee that he\nhas met with the East Cambridge Business Association and with members of the\ncommunity. He stated that One Kendall Square supports the plan because the\nhotel will bring an active use to this area. He stated that currently there is\nno active use in this area. He stated that there are 28 parcels in the IB\ndistrict with parcels that are large in scale with a FAR of 4.0 or larger. He\nstated that because of a 2.75 FAR no one builds there.\n\nHe stated that there are 2,400 short-term rental units but only 212 are\nregistered with ISD. He stated that short-term rentals use comprises 25% of\nwhat is deemed over-night stays in Cambridge. This proposed hotel use would\ndraw out some Airbnb\u2019s that are not registered. He commented that the\nWatermark Building and the Third Street Apartment building are the biggest\nAirbnb locations, which are registered through Global Luxury Suites, which\nshould not be a residence. These are being used as hotels and are not\nregistered. He stated that the market for the proposed hotel is for this\nAirbnb market. His rates will be competitive and will have to do more to draw\nin the crowds.\n\nThere was an 84% hotel occupancy rate in 2018 and there are over 100 nights in\nCambridge where every hotel room is booked. He noted that the demand is\nextraordinarily high. The average rate locally is $272 a night; national\naverage is $110, including unregistered 2200 Airbnb\u2019s. He stated that this\npetition has been characterized as up-zoning. He prefers to think of it a\nrestoration to a previous 4.0 FAR condition.\n\nThis is the perfect spot for this hotel use and for urban infill development.\nThree-dimensional renderings indicated that the grey zone is what could be\nbuilt by right and the blue area is what the 4.0 FAR would add. This is lower\nthan anything that is around it. He stated that Kendall Square is a great\neconomic engine for the City but is not active or vibrant at night.\n\nThis type of hotel pays their employees more and draws employees from the\nneighborhood. This lot will get the architectural attention that it deserves.\nHe stated that when the Central Square rezoning was addressed this same issue\nwas addressed to activate the space. This is a small change in the zoning to a\npre-existing condition. He stated that the Planning Board felt that this is\nthe best way to go.\n\nCouncillor Carlone asked if the City Councillors had any clarification\nquestions. None were offered.\n\nCouncillor Carlone asked how many square feet would be added to the proposal.\nMr. Boyes-Watson responded that the petition adds two floors and each floor is\n3,500 square feet. Councillor Carlone stated that the total building is\napproximately four times this. Mr. Boyes-Watson responded in the affirmative.\n\nCouncillor Carlone asked staff to come forward.\n\nMr. Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development, CDD, stated that the Planning\nBoard reviewed this petition on February 26, 2019 and recommended adoption\n(ATTACHMENT C). This district is largely characterized with office and lab use\nand larger scale buildings. It is unlikely that there would be a significant\nchange from this pattern except for a handful of small sites. He explained\nthat the Planning Board felt that incentivizing hotel use on the site was\nappropriate for the district.\n\nCouncillor Carlone noted that residential use was basis for the downzoning in\n2001 and asked what the Residential FAR currently is? Mr. Roberts stated that\nthis district had a maximum FAR of 4.0 and under 2001 City-wide rezoning it\nwas changed to allow for non-residential uses and changed to 2.75 FAR and for\nresidential it remained at 4.0. He added that this can be increased if it is\nfor inclusionary housing projects by 30%.\n\nCouncillor Carlone opened public comment.\n\nJohn Hawkinson stated that he had drafting comments that would make the\nproposed zoning ordinance clearer. He stated that there is a reference to\nsection 4.31.2 in the ordinance which does not exist. He believes this is\nintended to refer to 4.31 (i) 2 which in turn refers to the Table of Uses\nreferring to hotels. He wanted the City to amend the petition to reflect this.\nHe stated that more substantively this section is at the beginning of the\nTable of Uses section of the ordinance and it refers to the Table which\nfollows eleven pages later in Section 5.34 (entitled Industrial Districts). He\nstated that the table contains a footnote with an exception to those numbers.\nHe added that it is a bad idea to put one exception in a footnote of the table\nand have another exception eleven pages later and that the exceptions should\nbe together however they are handled. He stated that it is better that the\nchange be consistent with the Zoning Ordinance already written and to revise\nfootnote (e) of Table 5-4 in section 5.34 and to revise footnote (e) to\ninclude the language regarding hotels rather than putting it eleven pages\nearlier before the Table in a way that is different from how all other\nexceptions are handled. He requested that the City Councillor revise the\nordinance regarding his comments so that it is clear and easy to read and\nunderstand.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that the city would depend on Cambridge\u2019s zoning\nexpert to incorporate the suggested change and the Law Department to\nincorporate any overview change that is necessary.\n\nCouncillor Carlone opened discussion with the City Council.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan asked Mr. Roberts about Mr. Hawkinson\u2019s suggestions on\nwhether it should or should not be considered. Mr. Roberts responded in the\naffirmative. He stated that it is true that the hotel uses listed in 4.31 (i)\n2 rather than 4.31.2. He stated that generally when speaking of an exception\nthe dimensional standards they are mostly listed in the footnotes of that\nTable. He stated that in this case for Industrial Districts it will be Table\n5-4. He would also recommend that this is where this language should go.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan stated that he wanted to move the amendments. He stated\nthat this would be an improvement over the current conditions. He asked what\nsustainability features could be included in the building. Mr. Boyes-Watson\nstated there is limited ability to generate any power on the site. The\nbuilding will be as energy efficient as possible. He noted that the lot is\nonly 6,000 square feet and is limited in what can be achieved. This lot faces\nnortheast and he will work with the envelope to make this building as\nefficient as possible. Councillor Zondervan asked about living wage and\nproviding jobs for Cambridge residents. Mr. Ladha responded that no one would\nbe paid less than the living wage. It is their intention to meet or exceed the\nliving wage and would maximize the capture of local residents as employees.\nCouncillor Zondervan stated that residents from Newtowne Court and Washington\nElms would appreciate jobs in the hotel.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that given the location, existing parking is tight\nand seeking local workers who could walk to work would be a benefit.\n\nCouncillor Siddiqui spoke about hospitality programs. She stated that Just-A-\nStart is thinking about starting such a program. She asked what the buildout\ntimeline is. Mr. Boyes-Watson stated that based on completing this zoning\nprocess there would then be a planning and review process. Hopefully,\nconstruction would begin in the Spring of 2020 and will be eighteen months\nlong.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that the site is tight and this could prolong the\nconstruction cycle. He added that the site is presently a whole in the urban\nblock. He asked about the type of material that would be used for this\nproject. Mr. Boyes-Watson stated that this building has the ability to restore\nthe urban wall that creates the surrounding public space. There is a lot of\nfrontage given the small parcel size. He added that more money could be spent\non the facade because it has only one facade that faces out. He is hoping to\nuse high quality materials and a fair amount of glazing. The adjacent brick\nbuilding is dull, and the plan is stay away from brick but to add gravitas to\nthe building with a masonry kind of feel with bay windows or a sense of a bay\nwindow. He stated that it is thought of as a building that speaks to being\ninhabited by people and has a patina or scale such as a classic European\nhotel. This is the design intent. He stated that it would do well to do a\ncontrast and be an accent. He stated that this building could speak to One\nKendall Square across the street. Councillor Carlone stated that the building\nabutting has a lower blank wall, and this proposal should be an embellishment.\n\nCouncillor Carlone asked if this size of building is subject to design review?\nMr. Boyes-Watson stated that this project will go to the Planning Board and\nthere will be a public hearing so that the neighborhood is involved with the\nproject.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan now moved the amendments (ATTACHMENT D) - and on a voice\nvote the motion to amend -\n\nCarried on a voice vote of four members.\n\nCouncillor Carlone moved that the petition be referred to the full City\nCouncil with a favorable recommendation as amended - and on a voice vote the\nmotion -\n\nCarried on a voice vote of four members.\n\nA communication was received from Jason Alves, Executive Director, East\nCambridge Business Association, in support of the Grippo petition (ATTACHMENT\nE).\n\nCouncillor Carlone thanked all those present for their attendance.\n\nThe hearing adjourned at 3:36 PM\n\nFor the Committee,\n\n__________________________________\n\nCouncillor Dennis J. Carlone, Co-Chair\n\nOrdinance Committee\n\n"

During mold remediation at the two buildings this past fall,\nsignificant lengths of existing pipe insulation had to be removed and in some\ncases upgraded. Also, as part of the review of the mold issue at the Peabody\nSchool an engineering consultant determined that the air chiller for the\nPeabody School was preventing the building from properly cooling and removing\nmoist outside air, thus contributing to an environment conducive to mold\ngrowth.\n\nFunds will be used to seal fa\u00e7ade openings and conduct a comprehensive\nexternal review of the building\u2019s facades to determine if a more significant\nissue exists, as well as to continue the insulation upgrades begun earlier in\nthe school year. In addition, funds will be used to replace the existing air\nchiller at the Peabody School.\n\nAs I noted at the recent Tobin School Roundtable, our $500 million commitment\nto our School Building program would not limit our ongoing efforts to provide\nfunding for school building upgrades and repairs. During this fiscal year, the\nCity Council approved a $4 million appropriation for the Graham and Parks Roof\nproject, as well as an additional $600,000 for the boiler and cooling unit\nreplacement at the Solomon Garage.\n\n"

He announced\nthat the hearing was being audio and video recorded. He outlined the format of\nthe hearing: petitioners, City staff, clarification questions by the City\nCouncil, public comment and then recommendations and next steps.\n\nMayor McGovern made introductory remarks. He thanked all those involved with\nthe drafting of the Cycling Safety Ordinance. He thanked all who attended City\nCouncil meetings, speaking to make the streets safer, greener and healthier\nfor all, including cyclists and pedestrians. He stated that he hoped that this\nordinance will set expectations for use of the street spaces and how\ninfrastructure work will occur. He noted that the ordinance establishes\npredictability for businesses and neighborhoods and insures that the\ninstallation of permanent bike lanes is part of a thoughtful process that\nconsiders the whole streetscape. He spoke about the benefits of the Western\nAvenue infrastructure improvements. He stated that Cambridge is capable of\ncreating streets that work for all modes of transportation. He stated that the\nCity has been discussing making streets safer for pedestrians and cyclists for\na long time and there has been no shortage of research, studies and public\ncomment, rallies and meetings, but there are still too many injuries and\nfatalities on the streets. He commented that he never wants to attend another\n\u201cghost bike\u201d memorial again. He added that talk and process alone will not\ncreate the network of safe bike infrastructure that is needed. He stated that\nthe drafting of this ordinance was a team effort and represents reasonable\ncompromise on both sides to bring Cambridge to a necessary place.\n\nAt this time Mr. Durbin introduced Cambridge Bike Safety volunteers Mr.\nFeigenbaum and Ruthann Rudel. Mr. Durbin stated that Cambridge Bicycle Safety\nwill go over the purpose and goals. He stated that he will present the\nordinance text. He stated that the City departments will discuss the process\nand implementation. He proceeded with the Presentation (ATTACHMENT B).\n\nRuthann Rudel discussed Cambridge Bike Safety\u2019s purpose and goals. She added\nthat Cambridge enacted many bike infrastructure improvements, such as Vision\nZero, the Vehicle Trip Reduction Ordinance, Growth Policy Document, the\nClimate Protection Plan and zoning changes. She stated that the City Council\nhas goals for Healthy Community and the Environment and improving public\nsafety. She stated that making it possible to bike safely in Cambridge is\nconsistent with all of those policies.\n\nShe stated that redesigning roads to create safe space for cyclists is\ndifficult to achieve; it is controversial to reallocate road space. She noted\nthat this ordinance is intended to address some of the obstacles. She spoke\nabout cycling accidents that have occurred trying to cycle around the City.\nShe stated that Cambridge\u2019s data show that first responders are called to a\ncrash involving a bike and motor vehicle once every three days. She spoke\nabout the different levels of experience of cyclists and that the road needs\nto be made safer for cyclists to accommodate the different levels of\nexperience. She stated that 60% of residents were interested in cycling, but\nare concerned about safety, and 81% preferred protected bike lanes as a way to\nmove around the City. She stated that some active bicyclists are enthusiastic\nabout protected bike lanes and some aren\u2019t. The protected bike lanes are built\nto make cycling comfortable for all ages and experience levels to get around\nthe City safely. This is how there will be a sustainable mode shift.\n\nShe stated that the quick-build protected bike lane on Cambridge Street\nreceived a one-year report of data and bike crashes were reduced from 5 to 2.\nNo pedestrian crashes were reported. Motor vehicle speed was reduced from 31\nto 25 MPH. She also highlighted the benefits of the installation of the\nWestern Avenue Cycle track. She stated that 40% of common crashes in Cambridge\ninvolve dooring and would be prevented by protected bike lanes.\n\nMr. Feigenbaum stated that the data for the Cambridge and Western Avenue bike\nlanes indicates that speed has been reduced. This is significant regarding\nwhether a cyclist will survive from a crash with a motor vehicle. He added\nthat an individual hit by a car traveling 40 MPH is more likely to die than a\ncar traveling 20 MPH. He stated that with a network of protected bike lanes\nthere will be less of a \u201cWild West\u201d mentality on the roads. Cyclists will\nbehave more predictively because cyclists have a full network of reserved\nspace. This relieves stress for all users. This also promotes transportation\nequity by reducing greenhouse gas and promotes good health.\n\nMr. Durbin spoke about the purpose statement from the ordinance. He spoke\nabout the legislative background of the ordinance. Language was finalized in\nNovember and December and then introduced to the City Council. He reviewed the\ndefinitions. He stated that improvements do not include repairs to City\nstreets. He stated that there are only two requirements. The first is when\nimprovements are made to a City-owned street. Under the City\u2019s Street and\nSidewalk Reconstruction Plan, the City Manager shall ensure improvements\ncomply with the Cambridge Bicycle Plan or any superseding plan. If\nimprovements are made to a segment of a separated network, a permanent\nseparated bike lane with adequate directionality shall be installed along the\nsegment. He added that there are two exceptions under Requirements B. He spoke\nabout how the ordinance will be made effective and highlighted rare\ncircumstances.\n\nAt this time City Staff gave a presentation (ATTACHMENT C). DPW Commissioner\nO\u2019Riordan gave a brief background of the Five-Year Sidewalk and Street\nReconstruction Plan. This is included in the proposed ordinance, as it\ncontains streets and sidewalks that the City anticipates repairing in five\nyears. He stated that the program has been in place since 2007. He stated that\nthe FY 2018 map shows the projected improvements to streets and large utility\nprojects. The five-year plan promotes the Complete Streets philosophy and\nVision Zero. He stated that Complete Streets are designed to be accessible for\neveryone. He stated that by the City Council adopted Complete Streets and\nVision Zero, and since 2016 there has been more State funding received by the\nCity. He stated that other policies and plans such as the Pedestrian Plan,\nBike Plan, Transit Plan, Climate Change Plan, and Urban Forest are all\ndeveloping plans for the streets. He stated that the Vehicle Trip Ordinance\nand Cambridge Growth Policy promote livability and improved air quality by\nreducing gas emissions. He spoke about ways to improve mobility. He stated\nthat a Traffic Calming Program has been enacted for twenty years. The core\ngoal of the Five-Year Plan was to look at accessibility across the City. He\nspoke about sidewalks and streets being more welcoming to all. He explained\nwhat the City looks at in terms the sidewalks being accessible. He explained\nthe criteria taken into consideration when doing sidewalk reconstruction. He\nstated that the Bike Plan contains a framework for providing accessibility for\nComplete Streets across the City. He spoke about accessibility for people\nusing public transit. He stated that the City infrastructure is improved to\nprovide a more efficient and better experience for those who use public\ntransit. He spoke about street trees and the City is considering more ways to\nplant trees in the public right of way to provide mitigation for urban heat\nisland impact. He stated that the Five-Year Plan will be updated this year.\n\nMs. Suzanne Rasmussen spoke about the 2015 Bike Plan (ATTACHMENT D), which is\nthe starting point for the ordinance. She stated that the Bike Plan will be\nupdated.\n\nMs. Cara Seiderman stated that the Bike Plan was published in 2015 and the\noverall vision is for the City to have a Street Network that accommodates\ncycling as a mode of transportation for those of all ages and ability. She\nadded that there are many other elements needed to support cycling in the Bike\nPlan, including bike parking, expanding the Bluebikes program and cycling\nclasses. The Bike Plan is available online. She noted that the data is\ncontinually being reviewed to analyze volume, crashes and determine when more\nimmediate action is needed. She explained the importance of bike comfort and\nsafety for cyclists. Examples were provided to explain the bicycle level of\ncomfort. There was map outlining the bicycle level of comfort. She spoke about\nwhat a separated bike lane would look like and that there are many ways to\ncreate a separated bike lane. The existing and planned network were reviewed\nwith the major destinations and a network of streets that connected the major\ndestinations together with a comfort level of the streets to determine what\nthe best locations for separated bike lanes. She stated that the ordinance\nfocuses on the purple on the map which are the more major street corridors.\nShe stated that the full network contains all the elements. She stated that\nthere will be a technical update in the revised Bike Plan and adding items to\nthe toolbox and adding Vision Zero into the Bike Plan. There will be a\nfeasibility assessment to add new sections to the Bike Plan update and an\nimplementation plan. This will take about 18 months with a robust community\nprocess.\n\nMs. Rasmussen stated that there are exemptions in the ordinance. She spoke\nabout physical features of the street that would prevent a protected bike\nfacility to be installed, the usage of street and the financial constraints.\n\nCouncillor Toomey noted that the cycling safety ordinance does not include\nmandatory helmet requirements and proper lights on bikes at night. He\nquestioned why was this omitted. Ms. Seiderman responded that there is a state\nand City law requiring lights at night. The City provides lights for free at\nall City events and advocacy groups help install lights on bikes. Bluebikes\nhave built in lights. State law mandates the use of helmets for those 16 years\nof age and under. She added that these facilities are safer because they\nprevent crashes and a helmet will not prevent a crash. She stated that this is\nto prevent crashes from happening at all. Councillor Toomey stated that he\nwanted the Police Department to provide information on how many citations were\nissued for bikes without lights at night.\n\nCouncillor Kelley stated that more can be done than this ordinance. He\nexpressed concern with the exceptions regarding physical features of the\nstreet, usage of the street and financial constraints. He stated that the\nordinance seems constrained. He doesn\u2019t want the ordinance to make things\nworse for cyclists creating unsafe conditions. He asked if the City has the\nauthority not to follow this ordinance from a financial implication that would\nmake it worse for cyclists. Ms. Rasmussen stated that if the City Manager\ndetermined that this was not feasible it would be documented in a public\nreport explaining why this was detrimental from the usage of the street\nperspective. Councillor Kelley stated that in 12.22.040 (B) he wanted to know\nthat there is discretion for safety in the ordinance. Ms. Rasmussen stated\nthat safety is paramount in all City street designs.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux asked if this will be part of the upcoming 18-month study\nto look at where these three exceptions can arise. Ms. Rasmussen stated that\nthis is intended to last into the future. Ms. Seiderman stated physical\nfeatures are easier to identify and less likely to change. She spoke about\nlooking at the corridors and looking at the barriers. Mr. Feigenbaum stated\nthat the compromise was to keep the exceptions definition open ended to give\nthe City Manager adequate discretion when needed. She added that the rare\ncircumstances language is to keep the exception truly a rarity and not\nbecoming a standard operating procedure. Mr. Durbin stated that this was to\ntie the Cambridge Bike Plan and the Five-Year Construction Plan together.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan stated that Hampshire Street\u2019s vision plan included\nseparated bike lanes, but they could not be installed without removing\nsignificant amounts of car storage. He asked if Hampshire Street were updated\nunder the ordinance would separate bike lanes be installed. Ms. Rasmussen\nstated that these decisions are not being made now. She stated that in the\nfuture the demand for parking will decrease because of the use of autonomous\nvehicles that do not need to park along the street. She added that this is\nabout looking at the network and connecting all the destinations and this has\nbeen the process to lay out the network. Councillor Zondervan commented that\nif the ordinance is in place the decision to add protected bike lanes on\nHampshire Street will be made when the street is up for reconstruction. Ms.\nRasmussen stated that the determination will be made at the time when the\nstreet is up for reconstruction.\n\nCouncillor Mallon compared the Bike Plan, the Five-Year Construction Plan and\nthe bike network with key destinations and stated that it was helpful to see\nthem all together. There is another map with what the existing network looks\nlike. The Bike Plan will look at technical analysis and in 2020 when the Bike\nPlan is updated there will be an updated network plan that will take the place\nof the existing one. Ms. Seiderman stated that some of the things are in place\nnow. Councillor Mallon asked will any construction for 2019-2020 have bike\nlanes. Mr. Barr stated that on the non-capital side there is intention to\npursue the quick build strategy for bike lanes that will be used outside of\nthe context of this ordinance and the Five-Year Plan. Councillor Mallon stated\nthere are still quick builds planned before the Bike Plan is updated. Mr. Barr\nresponded in the affirmative and the 5 Year Plan is the ultimate way to get\nthis done. Mr. Feigenbaum stated that Cambridge Bike Safety sees this\nordinance as a long-term plan. Councillor Mallon stated that she is happy to\nsupport the ordinance and the plans until the Bike Plan is updated.\n\nCouncillor Siddiqui asked for a point of clarification regarding the financial\nconstraints and for this be explained. Ms. Rasmussen stated there are\nsituations where it would be beyond typical reconstruction costs. She\nexplained that if it were physically impossible to widen a street to install a\nseparated facility, or it would require the City to take private land by\neminent domain, which would be too costly are examples of such constraints.\nCouncillor Siddiqui asked if the feasibility study would look at this. Ms.\nRasmussen stated that the feasibility will be looking at this.\n\nMayor McGovern noted that this has taken collaboration on both sides. He\nstated that the exceptions are there because the City needs the exceptions. He\nstated that this is an ordinance about infrastructure. He stated that cyclists\nand motorists do not always follow the rules, and this is a behavioral issue.\nThis is a commitment to build out the network.\n\nCouncillor Carlone opened public comment at 6: 45 PM.\n\nGeorge Schneelock, 81 School Street, Somerville, stated that Allison Donovan\ndied in Somerville. He asked for faster implementation of Vision Zero measures\nin Somerville. He stated that signatures were submitted to Somerville and the\nnext day Paula Shraga died in Boston. This fatality pushed Boston to bring up\nsafety issues. He stated that safety issues should be addressed and not\nrequire advocacy. He supported the ordinance and rapid implementation is\nneeded to build the separate lanes. He submitted his comments (ATTACHMENT E).\n\nMark Boswell, 105 Walden Street, spoke about supporting the ordinance as\neffective motivation to build out the network and would stand along with the\nVehicle Trip Ordinance and ADA compliance. He submitted his comments\n(ATTACHMENT F).\n\nRandy Stern, 12 Kenwood Street, member of the Cambridge Bike Committee, stated\nhe strongly supported the ordinance. This will empower the City staff around\nbike infrastructure and noted that every implementation is a tradeoff and\nfacilities will be built. He stated that if this ordinance were in place there\nwould be protected bike lanes on Huron Avenue.\n\nKimberly Hunt, 10 Wendell Street, stated her support for the ordinance for\npermanent protected bike lanes. She explained why she bikes. She stated that\nshe is disabled and has cerebral palsy and has difficulty walking. She relies\non public transit and her bike to get around. She stated that for her cycling\nis the best way to get around and allows her freedom. She stated that her\ncommute along a protected route is the best part of her day. She spoke about\nher boyfriend who does not bike because of his fear of getting hit by a car.\nThis ordinance will provide mobility and protected bike lanes will increase\nbiking. She stated that protected bike lanes are the solution to get people\nout of their cars. She submitted her comments (ATTACHMENT G).\n\nJivan Sobrinho-Wheeler, 19 Trowbridge Street, stated that he is in favor of\nthe ordinance. He spoke about the high cost of bike lights and helmets. He\nstated that issuing citations will not increase light and helmet use and will\nincrease costs for low income residents, the majority of whom are black and\nbrown residents. He spoke of an accident he had on his bike on Mt. Auburn\nStreet. He stated that the 2014 plan had protected bike lanes for Mt. Auburn\nStreet but has not occurred. He stated that adding protected bike lanes on Mt.\nAuburn Street will be an improvement. He spoke about multiple deaths for\ncyclists. He submitted his comments (ATTACHMENT H).\n\nGavin Lund, 166 Charles Street, stated his support for the ordinance and is\nencouraged by the dialogue. He appreciates the comments made by Mayor McGovern\nregarding behavior versus infrastructure.\n\nAnnie Tuan, 129 Franklin Street, stated that she is in favor of the cycling\nsafety ordinance. She shared a story of someone who does not bike. The woman\nwill not ride a bike on City streets because it is too scary. She added that\nbuilding protected bike lanes will allow her friend to bike.\n\nYurok Loke, 18 Lawrence Street, Medford stated that he bikes to Cambridge\nevery day where he works. He stated that about 8 months ago he had an accident\nwith an 18-wheeler and spent time in the hospital. He spoke about the recent\nfatal death in Somerville. He noted that trucks in the Boston area killed 8-13\ncyclists over the last five years. He urged adding off road bike paths and for\nthe city to be creative. He spoke about maintaining off road bike paths.\n\nEric Garnick, 6C Chester Street, stated that he has been cycling in Cambridge\nsince 1970 and acknowledged the improvements. He stated that horseback riding\nis more dangerous than cycling. He stated that perception is a significant\naspect of the issue. He spoke about the speeding on a one-lane side street,\nOrchid Street.\n\nTed Feldman, 48 Gorham Street, Somerville, stated that he is a member of the\nSomerville Bicycle Advisory Committee. He stated that this is a good first\nstep in the right direction for safety infrastructure. This is an\nenvironmental and equity issues. He stated that data shows that installing\nprotected bike lanes reduces the stress of riders. He spoke about working with\nSomerville on improvements to Webster Avenue, which unfortunately is not part\nof the street improvement plan for Cambridge. He asked Cambridge to reconsider\nimprovements to the Cambridge portion of Webster Avenue. The plan needs to be\nexpanded and the data analyzed.\n\nItamar Turner-Turing, 130 Oxford Street, supported the ordinance and stated\nthat the key issue is implementation. He stated that motorists will need more\ntime to find parking and be upset about the bike lanes. He stated that biking\nis a low-income transportation and one year of biking is about what a motorist\nspends on their car for a month.\n\nJanie Katz-Christie, 166A Elm Street, runs Green Streets Initiative, a multi-\nmodal monthly day of awareness about health and sustainable ways to get\naround. She stated that there are 4,000 - 5,000 participants per year. She\nstated that her organization promotes all types of car-light transportation.\nShe stated that she goes out of her way to travel on protective bike lanes.\nShe stated that cyclists have a right to be in the \u201clane\u201d. The law has not\nbeen clarified as to who belongs in the lane. It is unfair to be killed riding\na bike.\n\nBecca Wolfson, Director, Boston Cyclist Union, 114 School Street, Somerville\nstated that she bikes from Somerville to Roxbury every day. She stated that\nthis ordinance will be a great step forward. She stated that no one wishes\nthere were more cars on the road. She applauded the work and stated that this\ncould unlock more resources and provide efficiency in City government. She\nwanted the implementation of the ordinance paired with proper maintenance and\nrobust counting data. She added a connected network is important and wanted\nstreets added in as soon as possible in the network.\n\nNate Fillmore, 13 Marcella Street, applauded the work of all the City Council,\nCity Manager and the City staff that have worked on this.\n\nAnn Dinoto, Arlington stated that she has ridden her bike for 15 years but\nstopped after seeing three bike fatalities. She stated that the she is afraid\nto leave her house because of the fatalities that she has witnessed and for\nfear for her safety.\n\nAt 7:21 PM Councillor Carlone closed public hearing.\n\nMayor McGovern wanted to move this forward with a favorable recommendation\n\nVice Mayor Devereux agreed and thanked all who worked on this. She stated that\nthis is a long-term plan and marks a landmark of shifting attitude and having\nmore protected facilities the momentum will grow. Cambridge is known for\nseeing the world differently and seeing inequities and trying to address them.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan supported the ordinance passage and implementation.\n\nCouncillor Siddiqui commended the Vice Mayor Devereux for her advocacy on\nthis.\n\nCouncillor Kelley supports this but wanted a more discussion on safety for\nbiking. He looks forward to being part of the discussion.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that this is a basic part of urban design and he\nwanted planted medians instead of stripped asphalt areas separating cars from\nbikes. He thanked all who worked on this.\n\nAt this time Mayor McGovern moved that this be forwarded to the full City\nCouncil with a favorable recommendation. The motion carried on vote of six\nmembers.\n\nThe following communication were received on this matter:\n\nA communication was received from Ryan Frazer, 24 Copley Street, in support of\nthe Cycling Safety Ordinance (ATTACHMENT I).\n\nA communication was received from Madeleine Daepp, NSF Graduate Research\nFellow, MIT, in support of the Cycling Safety Ordinance (ATTACHMENT J).\n\nA communication was received from Bence Becky in support of the Cycling Safety\nOrdinance (ATTACHMENT K).\n\nA communication was received from Vivid Siri, Allston Street, urging the City\nCouncil to pass the Cycling Safety Ordinance (ATTACHMENT L).\n\nA communication was received from Kirti Magudia in support of the Cycling\nSafety Ordinance (ATTACHMENT M).\n\nA communication was received from Adriane Musgrave, in support of the Cycling\nSafety Ordinance (ATTACHMENT N).\n\nA communication was received from Nate Sharpe, in support of the Cycling\nSafety Ordinance (ATTACHMENT O).\n\nA communication was received from Ben Sobel, in support of the Cycling Safety\nOrdinance (ATTACHMENT P).\n\nA communication was received from Cindy Bishop, in support of the Cycling\nSafety Ordinance (ATTACHMENT Q).\n\nA communication was received from Adam Beerman, in support of the Cycling\nSafety Ordinance (ATTACHMENT R).\n\nA communication was received from Christopher Cassa, in support of the Cycling\nSafety Ordinance (ATTACHMENT S).\n\nA communication was received from Herb Wagner, 163 Brattle Street, in support\nof the Cycling Safety Ordinance (ATTACHMENT T).\n\nA communication was received from Jason Rosenman, 346 Harvard Street, in\nsupport of the Cycling Safety Ordinance (ATTACHMENT U).\n\nA communication was received from Jeffrey Finkelstein, in support of the\nCycling Safety Ordinance (ATTACHMENT V).\n\nA communication was received from Caroline Jaffa, 28 Ellsworth Avenue, in\nsupport of the Cycling Safety Ordinance (ATTACHMENT W).\n\nA communication was received from Ann Cason-Snow, 24 Marley Street, in support\nof the Cycling Safety Ordinance (ATTACHMENT X).\n\nA communication was received from Jesse Boudart, 108 Elm Street, in support of\nthe Cycling Safety Ordinance (ATTACHMENT Y).\n\nA communication was received from Alexander Frieden, 4 Lake Street,\nSomerville, urging the City Council to vote on the Cycling Safety Ordinance\n(ATTACHMENT Z).\n\nA communication was received from Joan Hill, 18 Banks Street, urging the input\ninto the Cycling Safety Ordinance of the disabled and senior population\n(ATTACHMENT AA).\n\nA communication was received from Dien Ho, 395 Broadway, in support of the\nCycling Safety Ordinance (ATTACHMENT BB).\n\nA communication was received from Catherine Melnikow, in support of the\nCycling Safety Ordinance (ATTACHMENT CC).\n\nA communication was received from Julian Astbury, 92 Wendell Street, in\nsupport of the Cycling Safety Ordinance (ATTACHMENT DD).\n\nCouncillor Carlone and Councillor Kelley thanked all those present for their\nattendance.\n\nThe hearing adjourned at 7:29 PM.\n\nFor the Committee,\n\n__________________________________\n\nCouncillor Dennis J.

            "aceladescription": "I am writing in response to Awaiting Report Item Number 19-1, which requests a\nreport on the recently adopted regulations of the short-term rental revenue\nand the necessary steps to impose and access the revenue from the excise and\ncommunity impact fees. Please see the attached legal opinion from the City\nSolicitor providing a detailed analysis of the above questions. Below is a\nsummary of the action the Council may take concerning the short-term rental\nlocal option room occupancy excise tax and community impact fees, for the\nCouncil\u2019s consideration. Additionally, please note that information concerning\nthe new short-term rental legislation and the City\u2019s Short-Term Rental Zoning\nOrdinance is available on the Inspectional Services Department (\u201cISD\u201d)\nwebsite, and the City will be mailing another communication to all property\nowners informing them of the requirement that all short-term rentals obtain a\nCertificate of Registration from ISD.  \n  \nThe recently adopted legislation known as An Act Regulating and Insuring\nShort-Term Rentals, which is Chapter 337 of the Acts of 2018 (the \u201cAct\u201d),\nmakes short-term rentals as of July 1, 2019 subject to state room occupancy\nexcise tax, and allows municipalities to impose local room occupancy excise\ntax (\u201cLocal Room Tax\u201d) on short-term rentals. The City has previously adopted\nthe Local Room Tax in the amount of six percent (6%), and the Act\nautomatically amends the Local Room Tax to also apply to short-term rentals,\nso no further action is required by the City Council for the Local Room Tax to\napply to short-term rentals.  \n  \nThe Act also allows municipalities to adopt G.L. c.64G, \u00a73D in order to impose\na Community Impact Fee in an amount up to three percent (3%) of rent on the\ntransfer of occupancy of short-term rentals as of July 1, 2019. If adopted, at\nleast thirty-five percent (35%) of the funds collected have to be used for\naffordable housing or local infrastructure projects. The Community Impact Fee\nis broken down into two categories, each of which requires a separate vote to\naccept by the City Council.  \n  \nThe first category is \u201cprofessionally managed units.\u201d Although the City\u2019s\nShort-Term Rental Zoning Ordinance, which is Article 4, Section 4.60 of the\nCambridge Zoning Ordinance (the \u201cSTR Ordinance\u201d), only allows operator-\noccupied short-term rentals or owner-adjacent short-term rentals, it is\npossible to have short-term rentals that are lawful under the STR Ordinance\nand that will fall under the Act\u2019s definition of \u201cprofessionally managed\nunit.\u201d A \u201cprofessionally managed unit\u201d is defined as \u201c1 or 2 or more short-\nterm rental units that are located in the same city or town, operated by the\nsame operator and are not located within a single-family, two-family or three-\nfamily dwelling that includes the operator\u2019s primary residence.\u201d Under the STR\nOrdinance, a single operator can have an operator-occupied short-term rental\nand an owner-adjacent short-term rental in a four-family dwelling. If this\nscenario arises, both of those units will be subject to the Community Impact\nFee under the definition of \u201cprofessionally managed unit\u201d even though they are\nnot operated by a professional management company.  \n  \nIf the City Council first votes to adopt the Community Impact Fee as to\nprofessionally managed units, the City Council may vote to impose the\nCommunity Impact Fee on the second category, which is short-term rentals\nwithin two-family or three-family dwellings that include the operator\u2019s\nprimary residence.  \n  \nA majority vote of the City Council is necessary for acceptance of G.L. c.64G,\n\u00a73D(a), which applies to the transfer of occupancy of professionally managed\nunits, and if that passes, a majority vote of the City Council is necessary\nfor acceptance of G.L. c.64G, \u00a73D(b), which applies to the transfer of\noccupancy of short-term rentals within two-family or three-family dwellings. I\nam hereby requesting that the Council vote to accept G.L. c.64G, \u00a73D(a) and\n(b).\n\n"

            "aceladescription": "I am writing to ask for your approval to seek authorization from the\nMassachusetts Office of the Inspector General (the \u201cIG\u201d) for the City to use\nthe Construction Manager at Risk (\u201cCMaR\u201d) procurement and construction method\n(the \u201cCMaR Method\u201d) in connection with the Tobin Montessori and Vassal Lane\nUpper Schools Project. By way of background, in 2004 the Massachusetts\nLegislature passed construction reform legislation that allowed Massachusetts\npublic agencies and municipalities to use the CMaR Method for the first time.\nThe CMaR Method has been commonly used by the private sector for some time and\nis an alternative to the design-bid-build approach used under M.G.L. c. 149.\nSince the legislation was enacted, many public entities have successfully\napplied for, and are using the CMaR Method.  \n  \nThe Office of the Inspector General has promulgated a set of procedures for\nusing the CMaR Method. Once a public agency or municipality\u2019s (hereafter\n\u201cMunicipality\u201d) governing body authorizes the use of the CMaR Method, the\nMunicipality submits an application to the IG, from whom the Municipality\u2019s\nawarding authority must obtain a notice to proceed in order to use the CMaR\nMethod. The application requires that the Municipality demonstrate the\nfollowing:\n\na: The Municipality has authorization from its governing body to enter into a\ncontract with a CMaR firm.\n\nb: The Municipality has the capacity and a plan and procedure that is in place\nand approved of by the governing body, where appropriate, to effectively\nprocure and manage CMaR services for the specific project and has retained the\nservices of a qualified owner\u2019s project manager.\n\nc: The Municipality has procedures in place to ensure fairness in competition,\nevaluation and reporting of results at every stage in the procurement process.\n\nd: The building project has an estimated construction value of $5,000,000.00\nor more.\n\ne: The Municipality has determined that the use of the CMaR Method is\nappropriate for the building project and states the reasons in writing for the\ndetermination.\n\nThis memorandum is intended to summarize the definition, advantages, and\nprocess governing the use of the CMaR Method in support of my seeking City\nCouncil approval to utilize this construction method for the Project. My\nsubmission to you of this memorandum is the first step in satisfying the above\nreferenced requirements for seeking approval to use the CMaR Method for the\nTobin Montessori and Vassal Lane Upper Schools Project and will answer the\nfollowing questions:\n\n\u00b7 What is CMaR?\n\n\u00b7 What procurement and construction methods has the City used for vertical\nconstruction projects in the past?\n\n\u00b7 What are some of the benefits and risks of using the CMaR Method?\n\n\u00b7 What is the timeline for the CMaR Method?\n\nWhat is Construction Management at Risk (CMaR)?\n\nThe CMaR is selected through a competitive procurement based on qualifications\nand price. The City will procure the CMaR via a two-step Request For\nQualifications (\u201cRFQ\u201d) and Request For Proposal (\u201cRFP\u201d) process.\n\nThe type of contract the City will enter into with the CMaR is a cost-plus\nfixed fee amount with a Guaranteed Maximum Price (\u201cGMP\u201d). The GMP is the sum\nof the CMaR fee, and the costs associated with the CMaR\u2019s general conditions\nfor construction, all of the filed sub bid trade contractors, the CMaR\nestimates for any un-bid subcontractors at the time of the establishment of\nthe GMP and includes the CMaR\u2019s contingency. The CMaR agrees to pay for costs\nthat exceed the GMP that are not the result of changes in the contract\ndocuments. This is one of the reasons a CMaR is selected prior to the plans\nand specifications being completed. The CMaR works with the owner and the\narchitect to develop the scope delineated in the contract documents as part of\nthe team.\n\nThe fixed fee is a percentage of the cost of the work and is submitted by the\nCMaR during the selection process based upon an estimated cost of\nconstruction. The CMaR\u2019s contingency belongs to the CMaR if it is needed but\nis turned over to the City if not used. The contingency is a line item within\nthe GMP and is used to incorporate missing items undefined at the time the GMP\nis established that arise during the project.\n\nBy law, the GMP cannot be established until the drawings and specifications\nare at a minimum of 60% complete. The closer the documents are to being 100%\ncomplete, the less the CMaR\u2019s contingency line item is. The Owner\u2019s\ncontingency is for owner-directed changes or unforeseen conditions unknown at\nthe time the GMP is established. The CMaR\u2019s contingency is included in the\nGMP; the owner\u2019s contingency is outside of the GMP.\n\nThe City Manager\u2019s project management staff will work closely with the City\u2019s\nArchitect, consultants and CMaR to determine the appropriate contingencies.\n\nWhat procurement and construction methods has the City used for vertical\nconstruction projects in the past?\n\nThe City has used M.G.L. c. 149 and the M.G.L. c. 149A delivery process in the\npast for bidding vertical construction. This process, also defined as \u201cdesign-\nbid-build\u201d, requires all of the construction bid packages to be available only\nafter 100% completion of the design documents. Under this traditional\napproach, the lowest responsible and eligible bidder is awarded the project.\n\nThe City has previously been approved by the IG to use the CMaR Method for the\n5 Western Avenue project, the Dr. Martin Luther King School on Putnam Avenue,\nthe King Open/Cambridge Street Upper School and Community Complex, the Foundry\nproject, and the Multi-Department Relocation Plan which was recently approved\nby the Inspector General.\n\nWhat are some of the pros and cons of using the CMaR method?\n\nPros:\n\n\u00b7 The selection of the CMaR through an RFQ process allows the City to better\ndefine the specific requirements the City is looking for in a CMaR firm. The\nsubmission of defined company qualifications the presentation of these\nqualifications by the CMaR team to a selection committee allows for a better\ninteraction of questions and answers to best determine the most qualified CMaR\nfor the project.\n\n\u00b7 The selection is based upon qualifications and experience relative to\nspecific City requirements, not the lowest price. The CMaR is selected, rather\nthan awarded due to the lowest bid. The working relationship between the CMaR,\nthe Owner and the architect is enhanced due to a working relationship that is\ndeveloped during the process leading up to the establishment of the GMP.\n\n\u00b7 The CMaR is directly involved with the selection and management of the scope\nof work for the filed sub-bid trades. Because the CMaR takes the lead in\ndefining the peripheral scope of work for staging, lifts, temporary lighting,\nmiscellaneous patching, fire stopping, etc., scope of work disputes (a cost to\nthe owner if they have merit) are minimized and this coordination places\nresponsibility directly with the CMaR as the responsible party for defining\neach sub-bidders\u2019 drawings and specifications.\n\n\u00b7 The CMaR provides pre-construction services, which aids the City\u2019s project\nteam with scheduling, budgeting, value engineering, phasing strategies, and\nconstructability reviews.\n\n\u00b7 With the CMaR Method, early bid packages for demolition and abatement of\nhazardous materials can run concurrently while the project design is being\nfinalized.\n\n\u00b7 The potential for change orders that occur as the result of gaps in the\nscopes of work as defined by the Architect is reduced because the CMaR is\nparticipating in the delineation of the scope of work during the pre-\nconstruction services.\n\n\u00b7 If the City and the selected CMaR do not come to an agreement as to the GMP,\nthen the City has the option of bidding the project.\n\nCons:\n\n\u00b7 The CMaR Method reduces the risk for the CMaR contractor as he/she is\ninvolved early in the schematic design process. The CMaR\u2019s risk is mitigated\nby his/her early involvement during the design phase and his/her contingency\nthat is established as part of the GMP.\n\n\u00b7 The CMaR Method reduces conflict risk between the City and the CMaR firm but\nthat risk is minimized with an overall increased cost at the time the GMP is\nestablished.\n\nWhat is the timeline for the CMaR Method?\n\nThe first step is the CMaR Method is submission of an application to the IG.\nThe IG\u2019s response for approval or denial of the application is due in 60 days.\n\nSubmission in April 2019 would place the IG approval in June 2019. This\ncoincides with Feasibility Study being prepared by Perkin Eastman, Inc. the\nFeasibility Study is scheduled to be submitted to the City in October 2019.\n\nGetting the CMaR under contract for the pre-con services will help provide\ncritical information as to site logistics and how to best handle the variety\nof options available to remediate any soil issues on this site.\n\nI look forward to answering any questions you may have about the application\nand the CMAR Method that we propose to use for this Project.\n\n"

He announced\nthat the hearing was being audio and video recorded. He highlighted the format\nof the hearing.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan gave a PowerPoint Presentation (ATTACHMENT B). He stated\nthat the current Tree Protection Ordinance was adopted in 2004 but it does not\nprotect trees. It applies to a limited part of the canopy. It applies to large\nprojects that need to undergo large project reviews. This is for 25,000 square\nfeet or above projects and does not pertain to affordable housing projects.\nThe current ordinance is retroactive to one year prior to a special permit\napplication. If an individual were to cut down trees two years ago and then\napply for a special permit on the property these trees would not be covered\nunder the ordinance. Only trees cut down within one year of applying for a\nspecial permit are covered. This applies to trees over eight inches in\ndiameter at chest height. He stated that the ordinance has a replacement plan\nwhich allows for a payment, based on a variety of conditions, to be made into\nthe Tree Fund instead of replanting trees or not cutting them down in the\nfirst place. He stated that the ordinance does not cover any trees cut down\noutside of large project review projects, any tree cut down more than one year\nprior to a special permit application and affordable housing projects. He\noutlined the proposed amendment. He explained that the amendment would\npreserve the affordable housing exemption. The ordinance also exempts\ndangerous and emergency situations. He stated that the amendment does require\na permit for significant trees more than eight inches that are removed and are\nnot part of a large project review, in which case they would already be\ncovered, or if removed more than one year ago. He stated that the permit would\nbe issued by Public Works and would be discretionary and would document why\nthe tree was cut down and the specifics pertaining to the tree being cut down.\nHe commented that no one cuts down their own large trees. A contractor is\nhired. He stated that the City would inform the contractors that a permit is\nrequired and that would help compliance. Contractors can obtain permits on\nbehalf of the property owner. He explained why this proposed amendment is\nneeded now. He stated that 18% of the tree canopy has been lost in the last 9\nyears based on preliminary data. He stated that the current data shows that\nthe loss is worse, and the task force analysis is showing that there will be\nmore loss in the future. He stated that the two solutions to the problem are\nto stop cutting down trees and to plant more trees. He acknowledged the work\nof Urban Forest Tree Task Force and noted that the Task Force will be making\nrecommendations in the future.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux asked why this did not include Wheeler Street. Councillor\nZondervan responded because it has inclusionary housing units. Vice Mayor\nDevereux stated that to her affordable housing does not include inclusionary\nhousing. This does not apply to Wheeler Street and does apply to Millers\nRiver.\n\nCouncillor Kelley stated that the copy of the ordinance he is looking at does\nnot have a retroactive date of one year. Councillor Zondervan stated that this\nis in the current ordinance. Councillor Kelley stated that it would be a\nretroactive hearing for trees that have already been cut down. He stated that\nthere would be a violation of cutting down trees within one year of the\nspecial permit application.\n\nCommissioner O\u2019Riordan stated that the existing ordinance applies to large\nprojects and there is nothing at this time regarding tree removal private\nproperty in the City that is not associated with a large project. This does\nplace a burden on the staff with this new amendment and he asked how this\nordinance will be enforced and if a tree is removed without a permit how is\nthis handled by the City. When legislation has been enacted such as plastic\nbags or polystyrene there has been significant outreach and education programs\nprior to promulgating the ordinance. He stated that it is custom that the City\nprovides notice and educational documents before implementing a change in\nregulations. He stated that his concern is that this is going to take time for\nthe City to do this. He stated that the Urban Forestry Masterplan has been\nongoing for the last eight months and it will be a while before the report\nwill be ready for consideration by the City Council. He stated that the\nintegrity of this work needs to be maintained and shared thoughts about\nchanges to existing ordinances while this work is on-going so that the City\nCouncil can be provided with a thorough analysis of what other communities are\ndoing, how best the City can provide different ordinances and/or regulations\nso as to better protect the tree canopy. He wanted to make the City Council\ncognizant of the Task Force\u2019s work as the Council considers changes to the\nexisting ordinance.\n\nCouncillor Mallon asked has there been any preliminary discussion with the\nUrban Forestry Task Force on this issue. She stated that the draft\nrecommendations will be done in May. She stated that the goal of this\nordinance is to collect data and to have conversations around alternatives.\nCommissioner O\u2019Riordan stated that the first few months of the task force was\nproviding background on the existing urban tree canopy, the loss and where the\nloss is most pronounced. He stated that the loss is most pronounced in\nresidential areas in the City. He stated that the reason for the loss is\nuncertain at this time. He stated that that are reviewing closer the loss in\nresidential areas and are looking at the degree to which pervious areas have\nbeen lost. He stated that this may be related to redevelopment or extended\ndevelopment on residential properties. He stated that the City is also looking\nat house sales and whether properties have been redeveloped where trees have\nbeen removed as a result of development. He stated that in terms of changing\nordinance and regulations and a meeting held in December looked at changing\nthe definition of significant tree. He stated that presently a significant\ntree is an eight-inch tree. He stated that they are looking at a six-inch tree\nbeing a significant tree, and this is consistent with what other communities\nare doing. He stated that they are looking at regulating tree loss across the\nentire City, looking at changing the way that mitigation costs are proposed\nand looking a mitigation when significant trees are cut down and diameter of\ntrees at breast height and the area of a tree trunk at breast height. He\nstated that tree species are being reviewed. He stated that there is details\nthat are been reviewed as to how to protect trees in the community. He stated\nthat it is important to let this conversation continue. He spoke about the\nmore significant protections for trees the more onerous it become for\nhomeowners to take down trees. He added people may be less likely to plant\ntrees in the future as well. He stated that there is a balance needed in\nincentivizing planting trees on private property. He spoke about protecting\npeople\u2019s ownership of property and rights of homeowners to protect their\nproperty. He noted that there are five more meetings scheduled.\n\nCouncillor Mallon stated that in May when the draft recommendations from Urban\nForestry Task Force come out will there be something that the City Council can\nwork with from that that addresses the issues outlined by the Commissioner of\nPublic Works or does the City Council have to wait for the final\nrecommendations in December. She asked if this ordinance does not get passed\nis there a way to have the data collected between now and May. Commissioner\nO\u2019Riordan stated that all the presentations, minutes and correspondence from\nthe public are on line on the Public Works page. He stated that the\nexpectation is that the draft report will also be on line. The draft report\nmay contain specific recommendations or may be more general. He stated that\nthe report will be detailed. He is unsure about the successfulness of the data\ncollection. He stated that the University of Vermont is working with the City\non this and they did the 2009 and 2014 studies and they have been asked to\nlook at the current 2018 study for consistency of the analysis.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that the proposed ordinance changes are benign.\nThere is nothing in this proposal that is threatening. He suggested sending\nout postcards and noted that word of mouth travels fast. Awaiting the\nrecommendations in May and what might be possibly ordained in September at the\nearliest, this proposal is not a terrible thing to have on the books and may\nnot be enforced immediately, isn\u2019t this a good start to let people know that\nthere is a concern. Commissioner O\u2019Riordan stated that it is benign from the\nperspective of the homeowner. He expressed his concern about enforcement and\nit is an onerous undertaking from the City\u2019s perspective. The amendment speaks\nto emergency circumstances and this is not defined in this proposal and asked\nwhat is considered an emergency. He spoke about the one-year period of time is\ndefined for significant trees, larger than eight inches. He stated that he\ndoes not think the proposed amendment is applicable for a special permit\nunless there is a change in the definition of a significant tree. Councillor\nCarlone spoke about making the language stronger and clearer. Commissioner\nO\u2019Riordan stated that if one is to remove any reference to a period of time\ndoes this mean that a property that lost a tree ten years ago would have to\nhave this mitigated to develop their property now.\n\nCouncillor Siddiqui spoke about urgency and competing with a process and how\nis this balanced. There are policy strategies could be considered now or do we\nor can we wait. She stated that she is struggling with this with that data\nbefore the City, the tree canopy loss and climate change.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux stated that we have already waited; this conversation\nbegan early last term. She stated that the City Council was prodded to start\nthis Urban Forestry Task Force, and this took six months to get this going.\nShe stated that there is no penalty in this ordinance. She spoke about the\nconcern with enforcement and used the example of Airbnb which the City is\nhaving trouble enforcing. She stated that this interferes with the work of the\nUrban Forestry Task Force and that the City Council acknowledges the urgency\nof their works and want to support them. She added that all this is doing is\ngathering data and it is not imposing any fines and does no more than allow\nthe arborist to have a conversation to suggest an alternative to the property\nowner. The longer before these conversations occur, the more trees will be cut\ndown. She wanted this proposal approved.\n\nDeputy City Solicitor Goldberg stated that the enforcement provisions existing\nin the ordinance would apply to this amended provision. He stated that the\nexisting enforcement provisions mention a stop work order if tree are removed\nin violation of the chapter and there could be penalties imposed.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan agreed emergency circumstance are not defined and this is\non purpose to give this discretion to the arborist to determine if an\nemergency exists. He would be fine adopting this as is and that this does not\napply to any trees more than one year. He stated that he does not believe that\nthis is retroactive from ordination and would not apply to trees cut down ten\nyears ago.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux asked why this is worded makes trees not subject to the\ncurrent ordinance and if included as proposed a permit request why the other\nenforcement mechanism apply. Deputy City Solicitor Goldberg stated that he is\nnot sure that the tree replacement fund provisions would apply to the\nmitigation plan. He stated that the enforcement section, 8.66.090, applies to\nenforcement remedies, including a stop work order, fines of $300 per\nviolation, the possibility of injunctive relief and alternative penalties for\nnon-criminal penalty. Councillor Zondervan stated that subsection D does\nspecifically reference the large project and it does not apply. Deputy City\nSolicitor Goldberg agreed. Vice Mayor Devereux spoke about Councillor\nZondervan\u2019s intent when drafting the proposed amendment. She stated that the\nCity Council can state that enforcement does not apply to this other type of\ntree. Deputy City Solicitor Goldberg stated that the ordinance could be\nwritten this way but if there is no enforcement provision there is no\nincentive to comply with the ordinance. If there is no compliance, there is no\npenalty for compliance. This is an ordinance without any teeth. The way the\namendment is written and if this section is being added in it is being put in\nthe context of the ordinance and it does have the enforcement provision. Vice\nMayor Devereux stated that a different approach to enforcement could be\nsuggested. She stated that a mechanism could be developed that would make the\ncontractor responsible, such as leaf blower ordinance.\n\nCouncillor Kelley stated that if the concern is about retroactivity he\nsuggested language at the end: This section is only applicable to trees\nstanding as of enactment of this section. He stated that if someone is cutting\ndown trees not related to a project this is not included in the ordinance. He\nasked if this is the intent. Councillor Zondervan stated that this states\nprocedures for other projects and the language could be changed to all\nprojects or significant trees. He stated that the intent is that this new\nsection would apply everywhere where the current section does not.\n\nAt 6:16 PM Councillor Kelley opened the hearing to public comment.\n\nLucas James Gyrator, 225 Brookline Street, spoke about the proposal by\nCouncillor Zondervan for tree protection. He requested the inclusion and\nconsideration of the following knowledge and guidelines. He requested that all\ntrees in the City of Cambridge are completely protected by the City\u2019s\nsystematic processes of protection. He requested that the protection apply to\nall trees on public, private, commercial, state and City properties and\npreservations. He requested that the implementation of this protection be\neffective to all trees of any kind. He requested that trees be protected\nespecially on private land. He stated that trees of this City are beings of\nthis earth and are to be respected for their life and being. They provide\noxygen and are the reason we are currently breathing. Trees filter the air and\ncontribute to the eco-system of all planetary life. He noted that trees are\nnot owned by the City or its people even though they may grow on illegally\nowned land or the land of private owners or in public space. He stated that\nthe concept of the ownership of a tree is out of the hands of any one person\nand thus trees do not fall under the ownership of people at all. He submitted\nhis comments (ATTACHMENT C).\n\nChristine Kuta, 7 Fairview Avenue, stated that the permitting process is a\nburden on the private land owner. She stated that she has a tiny house on a\nsmall lot of land and it is difficult to maintain. She stated that going\nthrough what seems a benign process of a permit is another thing she has to\ndeal with to get anything done on her land and it is also a burden on the\narborist. She noted that when the street trees around her house needed to be\ntrimmed it took a year to get this done. She stated that currently there is a\npublic dead tree across the street and has not been taken down since last\nyear. The Public Works Department is overburdened. She was not in favor of the\npermitting to add more work no matter how benign this is. She stated that she\ndoes care about the tree canopy of the City but disagrees with this new policy\nthat is based on maintaining the status quo. Climate change is here, and the\ntrees planted years ago were planted in a different climate and therefore they\nare dying. These trees need to be replaced with trees that are more resilient\nto the climate situation of today and the City should not waste resources\ntrying to maintain trees that are not going to survive.\n\nSusan Ringler, 82 Kinnaird Street, stated that the proposed ordinance is not\nnearly sufficient. She requested the entire City take a brief pause in cutting\nall trees on public and private land until the Urban Forestry Task Force can\nsubmit their recommendations and until the Tree Ordinance can be amended to\nactually give protection to mature trees. She spoke about a photograph on a\nnews clipping shows residential land and those who cut the trees were not\nresidents of the City; they were developers who purchased residential land and\ndeveloped and sold it. She noted that this is the major problem with tree loss\non residential land. She submitted a document showing the amount of carbon\nthat a large tree takes out of the air is exponentially essential. She stated\nthat the large trees are extremely valuable, and they need to be protected.\nShe submitted two documents (ATTACHMENT D-1 AND D-2).\n\nCarol O\u2019Hare, 172, Magazine Street, supported getting a tally on tree removals\nbut more importantly vigor and rigor are needed to effectively curtail tree\nremovals. The ordinance needs to be corrected that would require simple tree\nremovals, tree removals that are not associated with any project, to be\ncovered by this ordinance, which it currently does not do. She gave the\nexamples of someone who does not like shade or to rake leaves. This individual\ncould remove the tree without doing anything. She stated that there should be\na moratorium with specific exceptions and a waiver process. She stated that\nthere are other cities that have done this. She stated that Public Works needs\nmore personnel to monitor and enforcement this proposal. She submitted her\ncomments (ATTACHMENT E).\n\nRichard Krushnic, 20 Oak Street, stated that he supported the proposal\nsubmitted by Councillor Zondervan and some kind of a moratorium. He stated\nthat with the rapid development that the City is facing it is a given that\nthere would be tree removal without some type of a moratorium. He stated that\nthe tree loss rate is accelerating. He stated that the Public Works Department\nneeds more resources. There are 500 empty tree wells that need trees in them.\nThis will provide information for the task force. He stated that over half of\nthe trees removed are on private residential land. He stated that the City\nneeds some type of tree regulation on private residential land. He noted that\nthe accelerated tree loss is due to accelerated development. He stated that\nthe City needs a tree replacement regulation in place as soon as possible to\nstop this.\n\nAlison Field-Juma 363 Concord Avenue, stated that she supported the amendment.\nShe stated that it should require public notice and permitting for the removal\nof all trees on private property for whatever the reason is. She added that\nthere should be a justification for the removal and full mitigation of the\nnegative impacts of any removal where it is shown that it is not essential.\nShe commented that the City has a long history of restricting what property\nowners can do on their own property. She highlighted the benefits of trees.\nShe gave an example of the private property issue. She used the dormer; she\nwas unable to add a dormer to her roof to add a second bathroom. She noted\nthat this application was denied. She stated that a large cooper beech tree\nwas removed and cut down when the property changed ownership. She noted that\nthis tree was a major asset to the neighborhood. She stated that she does not\nunderstand why this change was allowed when a small ascetic change is not. She\nacknowledged that there are good reasons to remove trees; she removed trees on\nher property but planted more replacement than removed. She stated that she\nwanted some aspects of this proposal strengthened. She submitted her comments\n(ATTACHMENT F).\n\nNancy Donohue, Director of Government Affairs, Chamber of Commerce, stated\nthat members of the Chamber have expressed concern about certain aspects of\nthe proposal and she spoke about unintended consequences. She requested that\nthe Chamber be included in the discussions. She submitted her comments\n(ATTACHMENT G).\n\nSteven Nutter, Executive Director, Green Cambridge, stated that Cambridge is\nin a tree emergency and need the leadership of the City Council to plan a\nbetter future. He stated that this urgency means that this cannot wait. He\nstated that with the good work of the task force, this amendment sends an\nimmediate communication to all that Cambridge is serious about solving this\nproblem. He stated that the tree canopy will continue to decrease and will\ndecease to 10% by 2030. He noted that there are many actions that can be\ntaken, but it is simple plant more trees and stop cutting down the existing\ntrees. The City Council leadership is needed to make this change and without\nyour leadership this change cannot occur. He noted that the proposed amendment\nis a great first step to fix an outdated regulation, but this is only a first\nstep. He stated that Green Cambridge will help promote this change and educate\nresidents. He commented that trees make Cambridge livable and is a social\njustice and equity issue.\n\nHelen Kobek, 69R Gore Street, spoke about 100-year-old pin oak was destroyed.\nShe wanted the strongest amendment to the ordinance. She wanted trees\nprotected on private property and wanted a moratorium with adjustments as\nneeded.\n\nSylvia Parsons, 22 Hancock Street, stated that she supported the amendment and\nis in favor of strengthening it and for some type of a moratorium on the\ncutting of trees in Cambridge with necessary exceptions. She noted that the\ntimeline for climate change is unforgiving. She stated that the concept of\nreplacing trees while planting new trees is a good thing, but a fully-grown\ntree cannot be replaced. She spoke about the benefits of trees in terms of\ncarbon sequestration, mitigating heat wave and flood. She spoke about the life\nsupporting element of trees with moss growth and supporting insects. She spoke\nabout the complexities of the systems that are being destroyed.\n\nMarilyn Wellons, 651 Green Street, stated that feelings run high on this topic\nboth pro and con. There are some that feel that trees are a danger, but others\nsee the benefit of trees. She stated that this is a matter of life for both\nhumans and mammals and also for plants. She wanted a moratorium. She stated\nthat anything that the City Council does is necessarily part of the process.\nShe commented that the need for action is now. She stated that she is\nconcerned with the countervailing values at stake are embodied in the City\u2019s\ndevelopment strategies. She stated that the tree loss in residential\nneighborhoods is infill development in the name of additional units. She\nstated that the development in Kendall Square has removed trees. She went to\nmany tree removal hearings. She wanted enforceable action and protection of\ntrees including invasive and non-native. All trees sequester carbon and\nprovide benefits regardless of their pedigree.\n\nJules Kobek, 69R Gore Street, supported the amendment. She stated that it is\nmore important to protect large healthy tree rather than replace it with small\nsaplings. She noted that a new sapling may die, and it takes decades for a\nsapling to grow to a large tree. She stated that there needs to be protections\nfor trees sooner rather than later and penalties with teeth.\n\nKelly Dolan, 233 Upland Road, stated that she supported the amendment to the\ntree ordinance. She urged that a moratorium be proposed on cutting down any\nmore trees in Cambridge. She spoke about the importance of trees in mitigating\nclimate change by cleaning the air, shading the City and managing flood\nwaters. The tree canopy needs to be treated as a valued asset. She noted that\nlimiting property rights for private property is a difficult discussion, but\nthe collective well-being of the residents and the tree canopy needs to\nsupersede the personal rights of individuals. She stated that having clean air\nand water is a social justice issue. She submitted written comments\n(ATTACHMENT H).\n\nFranciscan Amedeo, 239 Mt. Auburn Street, trustee of Riverbend Park, stated\nthat she wanted the City Council to include trees on public land. She stated\nthat the Sycamore trees are in crisis along Riverbend Park. She supported the\namendment as a first step. All possible things need to be done to mitigate\nclimate change and trees have an important role. She encouraged the City\nCouncil to be more aggressive in addressing climate change. She wanted to see\nmore funding for planting trees on public land.\n\nPat Goudvis, 179 Harvey Street, encouraged the City Council to approve the\namendment. This is an emergency and we need something stronger than the\namendment. She noted that all benefit from trees.\n\nJohn Pitkin, 18 Fayette Street, member of the Friends of Inman Square, who are\nstill working to preserve the trees in the plaza in Inman Square. He stated\nthat he favored the proposed amendment. He noted that this would enable the\nCity to acquire valuable information on tree removals from private property on\nan ongoing basis. This would also provide an opportunity to educate property\nowners in a critical moment on the life of a tree. The City needs to\ncommunicate in order to have an impact on property owners\u2019 decisions to cut\ntrees. He stated that our survival depends on trees; individuals cannot live\nwithout trees. He stated that trees are living beings that take a few hours to\nkill and a lifetime to regrow. There is no such thing as just one tree,\nwhether public or private. These concepts are necessary for any voluntary\nmeasure to stop the loss of the tree canopy. He spoke about creating a culture\nof awareness and stewardship. He stated that a moratorium on the removal of\ntrees from private land would be a beneficial measure when the task force\nmakes their recommendations.\n\nCharles Franklin, 162 Hampshire Street, stated that he supported the proposal.\nHe highlighted the importance of trees and the quality of life. He noted that\nthe City does plant trees but has a hard time keeping them alive.\n\nMaggie Booz, 27 Lawn Street, spoke about this amendment bringing the tree\nemergency to the public floor. She does not support the amendment as it is\ninadequate, ineffective and it is premature to make ordinance changes before\nthe work of the Tree Task Force and the consultant have come to conclusions\nabout how to solve the crisis. What is not premature and is called for is a\ncomplete moratorium on tree cutting in the City until the task force has\ncompleted its work. She spoke about issues introduced by Hildebrand to the\nmonthly meetings of the tree task force. She stated that by 2030 with the\ncurrent planting, 600 trees a year, there will only be 1/2 the tree canopy of\nwhat the City has now. She stated that by 2070 there will be 9% of what the\nCity has now. She stated that this is a big problem.\n\nElaine Saporta, 102 Ellery Street, stated that she is a landscape architect\nand a member of tree task force. She noted that the tree task force is only\nhalfway through the process and the news is not good. She stated that it is\nknown what is killing the trees. She named development, over-salting, disease\nand the changing climate pressure and four years of successive drought as some\nof the reasons. She stated that this is a state of emergency. She supported a\nsix-month moratorium on the cutting of all trees in the City.\n\nFlorrie Wescoat, 33 Market Street, stated that she is the Co-chair of the\nCommittee on Public Planting, a member of the tree task force and a member of\nthe Friends of Inman Square. She stated that currently there is no incentive\nfor developers or property owners to preserve trees. Trees are being removed\nfor development and housing infill. She noted that there is less permeable\nspace for planting in the City. She stated that individuals want trees to\nshade them; to enhance the quality of life and to enjoy. She commented that\nthis is an issue of equity and social justice. She stated that the notion of a\npro-tree stance is anti-development or anti-housing is false. She stated that\nthe City needs development that respects the trees and to plant more. The City\nneeds to be leader to protect and preserve public trees. She appreciated the\nCity\u2019s commitment to an Urban Forest Master Plan but because of the rapid\ndiminishment of the canopy in Cambridge she urged a moratorium on tree cutting\nwhile the Urban Forest Master Plan is being developed.\n\nPaula Sharaga, 234 Columbia Street, stated that she has seen many trees\nplanted which have died. She noted that Columbia Street is an area where there\nis a need for trees to be planted. She supported the amendment but wanted the\nproposal to have more teeth, enforceable and a moratorium until this can be\nfigured out.\n\nPeter Valentine, 37 Brookline Street, stated that he magically intends to grow\nall the trees. He added that the money worshippers are killing the trees. They\nwill be completely eliminated from the earth.\n\nDick Clary, 15 Brookford Street, Chair, North Cambridge Stabilization\nCommittee, and a board member of the Association of Cambridge Neighborhoods,\nstated that he favored a moratorium and the case for a moratorium has been\noverwhelmingly made. He spoke about how this issue developed for him. He\nstated that 130 years ago Charles Eliot stirred the people up over the\ndestruction of the Waverly Oaks along the Belmont and Waltham line. He\nexplained that the citizen involvement that this created ended up with the\ncreation of the MDC. He noted that this is an example of what can happen when\nthere is a sufficient outrage being perpetrated. He stated that the present-\nday Charles Eliot has put together a document, a newspaper, that contains an\nenormous amount of information.\n\nJo Solet, 15 Berkeley Street, spoke about enforcement and was disturbed that\nin some way the leaf blower ordinance was considered a model here. She stated\nthat violating the ordinance is the cost of doing business for landscapers.\nShe spoke about all the violations to the leaf blower ordinance by contractors\nhired by the City. She stated that homeowner need to be included in the\nenforcement.\n\nCharles Teague, 23 Edmonds Street, distributed a list of 27 moratoriums passed\nby the City Council (ATTACHMENT I). He stated one moratorium that is not on\nthe list is the bio lab moratorium and it has shaped Cambridge. He stated that\nthis is not a big a deal and will not take as long. He stated that the task\nforce has already presented. The consultants, the Conservation Law Foundation,\nhave presented their nationwide review of tree laws on October 3, 2018 and in\nDecember guidelines were presented to change the laws. He stated that in 2002\nthe Supreme Court approved a moratorium for a short period of time, for less\nthan a year. He urged the City Council to choose a moratorium.\n\nRonda Massie, 211 Charles Street, spoke about balancing open space with\ndevelopment. She stated that the City\u2019s record on open space and trees is\ndismal. She acknowledged that it may be difficult to encourage homeowners and\ndevelopers to retain trees, it is disheartening to witness the number of trees\nthat have disappeared in the last several years. She spoke about the tree loss\nin the parking lot at the Charter School on Bent Street because of the\ndifficulty of plowing around trees. She spoke about infill development and the\n$3 million condos built that made it imperative that the trees were cut down\nfor these condos. She spoke about trees planted on both sides of Third Street\nfrom Kendall Square to Cambridge Street. She stated that the City planted\ntrees and did not water and none of these trees survived. She spoke about the\nloss of open space and trees at the Volpe Center.\n\nKate Frank, 53 Crescent Street, stated that all neighborhoods will be affected\nby the tree problem. She stated that people are speaking about this because it\nis our civic responsibility. She spoke about the Japanese who planted fruit\ntrees so that future generations will have fruit and wanted Cambridge to have\na similar attitude about our trees. She asked the issue of private property be\nrethought. She spoke about the need for education and it could be as\nsuccessful as the composting program. She stated that it may not move fast\nenough, but some movement is better than none.\n\nEllen Mass, President of the Friends of the Alewife Reservation, spoke about a\nmoratorium and the awareness about trees were not in front of the public\npreviously. She stated that this would have been a wonderful hearing to have\nhad before the Silver Maple Forest was taken down. She stated that most of the\ndiscussion has been about the past, but she wants to discuss what is coming\nup. There is a situation in North Cambridge where there is a one-acre\narboretum of sixty trees that were carefully planted forty years ago which is\na crime waiting to happen because the two developers have misrepresented their\nbuilding special permit to the Planning Board in December 2017 by leaving off\nthe major canopy of these rare arboretum planted trees. There is a new design\nmap, but it does not go along with what is in the tree ordinance. She stated\nthat the tree ordinance states that a full display of the entire design must\nbe given twenty-one days before the hearing by the Planning Board. This was\nnot done. She stated that there was a major misrepresentation of the design\nwhich had a court yard with these arboretums. She noted that the Public Works\nDepartment is going to investigate this situation. She explained that the\ntrees need to be removed to construct a garage underneath.\n\nErick Grunbaum, 98 Montgomery street, stated that he supports a moratorium;\nthe tree canopy is in serious decline. He planted trees in The Port in the\nl990s where at the time it cost $125 to get a street tree. He stated that he\nsought and received a grant to subsidize this for those who could not afford\nto plant trees. There are massive opportunities to plant more trees. He spoke\nabout counting the opportunities in the empty spaces in the sidewalks, not the\nempty tree wells, the spaces where trees can be planted. He stated that\n2,500-3000 locations had been found in each of two quadrants of the City. This\ncould yield 10,000-15,000 street trees which are the most important trees.\nThis is what provides shade and greenery. He stated that the City needs to do\na better job in investing in the canopy. He added that a short-term moratorium\nin reasonable. He supported more investment in the canopy, both in staffing\nand financing.\n\nCouncillor Kelley closed public comment at 7:17 PM.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan proposed and amendment and stated that Councillor Kelley\nwanted to capture the retroactive nature of the tree protection. His amendment\nwas to change the title of section 8.66.055 to strike out the word \u201cProcedure\nfor Other Projects\u201d and insert in place thereof the words \u201cProcedure for Other\nSignificant Tree Removals.\u201d He further moved to amend the section by striking\nout the first sentence and inserting in place thereof a new sentence which\nreads as follows: For any significant tree removal not subject to 8.66.050,\nexcept for emergency circumstances, a permit request will first be submitted\nto the City Arborist. He stated that a general moratorium on tree cutting\ncannot be considered because it is not part of this proposal. He stated that\nwhat the committee could consider is to not issue any permits proposed in this\nsection until the ordinance is further amended based on the recommendations of\nthe tree task force. He stated that he wanted the committee to consider this\nconcept.\n\nCouncillor Kelley noted that the amendment offered by Councillor Zondervan was\nto bring all significant trees under this section, not just those trees\nassociated with a project.\n\nThe second suggestion was to prohibit the granting of any permits until after\nthe tree task force finishes its work. Councillor Zondervan added that the\nordinance could be amended based on their recommendations.\n\nCouncillor Kelley moved for a recess at 7:22 PM.\n\nCouncillor Kelley reconvened the hearing at 7:24 PM.\n\nCouncillor Kelley noted that there is a lot of public interest in a\nmoratorium. He stated that another hearing can be scheduled to discuss the\namendments by Councillor Zondervan and does the committee want to delay the\ngranting of any permits which would be a defector moratorium or want to\ndiscuss a moratorium in some other fashion.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan stated that he wanted his clarifying amendments acted\nupon and can discuss a moratorium when the ordinance is adopted. He stated\nthat he did not favor having another Ordinance Committee hearing and wanted\nthis proposal to move forward to the full City Council.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux stated that she would vote in favor of the amendments\noffered by Councillor Zondervan and forward this to the full City Council.\n\nCouncillor Mallon stated that she was under the impression that regarding\nordinance committee hearings that the committee could make something less\nrestrictive and not more restrictive. She added that a moratorium seems more\nrestrictive. Deputy City Solicitor Goldberg responded that this applies to\nzoning provisions where there has been advertised zoning language and the City\nCouncil may be trying to make significant changes to this language and there\nmay be restrictions based on the language. He stated that this is not a zoning\nordinance and the issue of restrictions does not apply. The City Council can\nconsider something that has been advertised. He stated that the issue of these\namendments has been advertised.\n\nCouncillor Kelley stated that he is uncomfortable with passing a moratorium\nnow and does not understand the implications. He added that the moratorium was\nnot part of the call of the hearing. He stated that when this was advertised\nto the public it was if you care about trees and want public notice about\ncutting down trees come to this hearing. This was not advertised as if you\ncare about a moratorium come to this hearing. He stated that he feels that\nthis is a huge difference. He stated that there can be another hearing\nscheduled to specifically discuss a moratorium. He stated that this is a\ndangerous way to go. He would vote on the amendments but would not vote to\nmove this out of committee.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that he supports a moratorium but agreed with\nCouncillor Kelley\u2019s interpretation.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan stated that the amendment he forwarded to the City Clerk\ndoes not reference a moratorium; it is just the clarifying language. He moved\nhis amendments and stated that after amending he would move to refer to the\nfull City Council. He stated that when the issue gets before the City Council\na general moratorium could be discussed or not. Councillor Kelley stated that\ndiscussing a moratorium in the Ordinance Committee is a much better place for\nthis discussion. He stated that he supported amending the language and keeping\nthe matter in committee for another hearing and forwarding to the full City\nCouncil. He added that the subject of a moratorium should be the subject of a\nfull hearing. Councillor Zondervan stated that a more general moratorium is a\nseparate discussion and should not encumber the amendments. He is asking that\nthe amendments be moved forward and then discuss a moratorium as part of a\nseparate discussion.\n\nThe question now came on the amendments to change the title and the language\nof the first sentence in 8.66.055 submitted by Councillor Zondervan - and on a\nvoice vote of six members the amendments -\n\nCarried.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan now moved that the amended proposal to the full City\nCouncil for further discussion.\n\nCouncillor Kelley stated that he thinks that this is a bad idea and would like\nto explore the idea of what a moratorium might look like.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux asked how the Ordinance Committee would discuss having a\nmoratorium. She asked would there need to be language in front of the\ncommittee.\n\nCouncillor Kelley noted that it always best to have language before the\ncommittee.\n\nHe stated that Councillor Zondervan had an idea of making the permitting\nauthority of the City Arborist start only when the City Council had some type\nof actionable things from the tree task force and if the committee met to\ndiscuss this Councillor Zondervan or anyone else could provide language for\ndiscussion.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan stated that he is suggesting that a moratorium is a\ngeneral conversation and may be enacted in the way he proposed or may not, but\nhe would prefer this conversation with the full City Council and this\nconversation could always be brought back to the Ordinance Committee. He\nstated that he did not want to delay moving this forward since there is\nconsensus around the clarifying language. The moratorium is a separate\nquestion on whether there should be a moratorium on significant tree removals\nor for all trees removals. He stated that the full City Council should be part\nof this conversation. He stated that rather than keeping this in committee he\nwould prefer that this amendment be forwarded to the full City Council and\nthen the City Council can decide whether it wants to have a further\nconversation about a moratorium or to adopt this amendment as is or enact a\nmoratorium differently than through this proposal. He stated that these are\nbroader questions than his amendment which did not include language for a\nmoratorium.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that the only way that the City Council could\ndiscuss a moratorium if there is a petition submitted. He asked how this would\nbe discussed at the City Council level. City Clerk Lopez stated that this is\nan amendment to the Municipal Code and amendments can be made at any time. She\nexplained that the Ordinance Committee report would go before the full City\nCouncil who could accept the report and place it on file and pass to a second\nreading the original proposal as amended by Councillor Zondervan. Two weeks\nlater the proposal would be before the City Council for ordination and at this\npoint the proposal could be amended on the floor to add language regarding a\nmoratorium. Then it is up to the full City Council if they wanted to pass the\nproposal to be ordained as amended.\n\nCouncillor Kelley commented that it is simpler and cleaner to figure what is\nwanted in the Ordinance Committee than at a City Council meeting.\n\nCouncillor Kelley moved that this be referred to the full City Council and on\nthe motion the roll was called and resulted as follows:\n\nYEAS: Councillor Carlone, Vice Mayor Devereux, Councillor Mallon, Councillor\n\nSiddiqui and Councillor Zondervan \\- 5\n\nNAYS: Councillor Kelley \\- 1\n\nABSENT: Councillor Simmons, Councillor Toomey and Mayor\n\nMcGovern \\- 3\n\nand the matter was -\n\nReferred to the full City Council.\n\nThe following communications were received and made part of the report:\n\nA communication from Gretchen Friesinger, 18 Orchard Street, in support of\nCouncillor Zondervan\u2019s proposal to gather more data and supporting a tree\ncutting moratorium (ATTACHMENT J).\n\nA communication was received from Share Brodie, 253 Pleasant Street, in\nsupport of the proposed amendment to strengthen tree protection and in support\nof a moratorium (ATTACHMENT K).\n\nA communication was received from Bjorn Poonen, 303 Third Street, in support\nof the proposed amendment and suggesting the phrase \u201csignificant tree\u201d be\nused. (ATTACHMENT L).\n\nA communication from Charles Studen, 98 Erie Street, urging the City to adopt\na comprehensive plan to place all overhead utility lines underground within\nthe next twenty years to help the trees (ATTACHMENT M).\n\nA communication from Maria Ritz in support of the amendment to the Municipal\nCode on Tree Protection (ATTACHMENT N).\n\nA communication from Martha Older noted that gas leaks and the urban heat\nisland are killing the trees (ATTACHMENT O).\n\nA communication from Andrea Simpson, 2 Hutchinson Street, in support of the\nproposed amendment to protect the trees (ATTACHMENT P).\n\nA communication from Marilee Meyer, 10 Dana Street, noting that trees should\nbe considered as part of the topography for any zoning and transmitting\npictures of the Broadway and Prospect street trees (ATTACHMENT Q).\n\nA communication from Pamela Hart in support of a moratorium on cutting mature\ntrees on private property (ATTACHMENT R).\n\nA communication from Catherine Jaffa in opposition to cutting down any more\ntrees in Cambridge (ATTACHMENT S).\n\nCouncillor Kelley and Councillor Carlone thanked all those present for their\nattendance.\n\nThe hearing adjourned at 7:38 PM on motion of Vice Mayor Devereux.\n\nFor the Committee,\n\n__________________________________\n\nCouncillor Craig Kelley, Co-Chair\n\nCouncillor Dennis J.

DePasquale, City Manager, relative to a request for approval to seek authorization from the Massachusetts Office of the Inspector General (the \u201cIG\u201d) for the City to use the Construction Manager at Risk (\u201cCMaR\u201d) procurement and construction method (the CMaR Method\u201d) in connection with the Multi-Department Relocation Plan.",
            "aceladescription": "I am writing to ask for your approval to seek authorization from the\nMassachusetts Office of the Inspector General (the \u201cIG\u201d) for the City to use\nthe Construction Manager at Risk (\u201cCMaR\u201d) procurement and construction method\n(the CMaR Method\u201d) in connection with the Multi-Department Relocation Plan. By\nway of background, in 2004, the Massachusetts Legislature passed construction\nreform legislation that allowed Massachusetts public agencies and\nmunicipalities to use the CMaR Method for the first time. The CMaR Method has\nbeen commonly used by the private sector for some time and is an alternative\nto the design-bid-build approach used under M.G.L. c. 149. Since the\nlegislation was enacted, many public entities have successfully applied for,\nand are using the CMaR Method.  \n  \nThe Office of the Inspector General has promulgated a set of procedures for\nusing the CMaR Method. Once a public agency or municipality\u2019s (hereafter\n\u201cMunicipality\u201d) governing body authorizes the use of the CMaR Method, the\nMunicipality submits an application to the IG, from whom the Municipality\u2019s\nawarding authority must obtain a notice to proceed in order to use the CMaR\nMethod. The application requires that the Municipality demonstrate the\nfollowing:  \n  \na: The Municipality has authorization from its governing body to enter into a\ncontract with a CMaR firm.  \n  \nb: The Municipality has the capacity and a plan and procedure that is in place\nand approved of by the governing body, where appropriate, to effectively\nprocure and manage CMaR services for the specific project, and has retained\nthe services of a qualified owner\u2019s project manager.  \n  \nc: The Municipality has procedures in place to ensure fairness in competition,\nevaluation and reporting of results at every stage in the procurement process.  \n  \nd: The building project has an estimated construction value of $5,000,000.00\nor more.  \n  \ne: The Municipality has determined that the use of the CMaR Method is\nappropriate for the building project and states the reasons in writing for the\ndetermination.  \n  \nThis memorandum is intended to summarize the definition, advantages, and\nprocess governing the use of the CMaR Method in support of my seeking City\nCouncil approval to utilize this construction method for the Multi-Department\nRelocation Plan. My submission to you of this memorandum is the first step in\nsatisfying the above referenced requirements for seeking approval to use the\nCMaR Method for the Multi-Department Relocation Plan and will answer the\nfollowing questions:  \n\n\u00b7 What is CMaR?\n\n\u00b7 What procurement and construction methods has the City used for vertical\nconstruction project in the past?\n\n\u00b7 What are some of the benefits and risks of using the CMaR Method?\n\n\u00b7 What is the timeline for the CMaR Method?\n\nWhat is Construction Management at Risk (CMaR)?  \n  \nThe CMaR is selected through a competitive procurement based on qualifications\nand price. The City will procure the CMaR via a two-step Request For\nQualifications (\u201cRFQ\u201d) and Request For Proposal (\u201cRFP\u201d) process.  \n  \nThe type of contract the City will enter into with the CMaR is a cost plus\nfixed fee amount with a Guaranteed Maximum Price (\u201cGMP\u201d). The GMP is the sum\nof the CMaR fee, and the costs associated with the CMaR\u2019s general conditions\nfor construction, all of the filed sub bid trade contractors, the CMaR\nestimates for any un-bid subcontractors at the time of the establishment of\nthe GMP, and includes the CMaR\u2019s contingency. The CMaR agrees to pay for costs\nthat exceed the GMP that are not the result of changes in the contract\ndocuments. This is one of the reasons a CMaR is selected prior to the plans\nand specifications being completed. The CMaR works with the owner and the\narchitect to develop the scope delineated in the contract documents as part of\nthe team.  \n  \nThe fixed fee is a percentage of the cost of the work and is submitted by the\nCMaR during the selection process based upon an estimated cost of\nconstruction. The CMaR\u2019s contingency belongs to the CMaR if it is needed, but\nis turned over to the City if not used. The contingency is a line item within\nthe GMP and is used to incorporate missing items undefined at the time the GMP\nis established that arise during the project.  \n  \nBy law, the GMP cannot be established until the drawings and specifications\nare at a minimum of 60% complete. The closer the documents are to being 100%\ncomplete, the less the CMaR\u2019s contingency line item is. The Owner\u2019s\ncontingency is for owner-directed changes or unforeseen conditions unknown at\nthe time the GMP is established. The CMaR\u2019s contingency is included in the\nGMP; the owner\u2019s contingency is outside of the GMP.  \n  \nThe City Manager\u2019s project management staff will work closely with the City\u2019s\nArchitect, consultants and CMaR to determine the appropriate contingencies.  \n  \nWhat procurement and construction methods has the City used for vertical\nconstruction projects in the past?  \n  \nThe City has used M.G.L. c. 149 in the past as the bidding process for\nvertical construction. This process, also defined as \u201cdesign-bid-build\u201d,\nrequires all of the construction bid packages to be available only after 100%\ncompletion of the design documents. Under this traditional approach, the\nlowest responsible and eligible bidder is awarded the project.  \n  \nThe City has previously been approved by the IG to use the CMAR Method for the\n5 Western Avenue Project, the Dr. Martin Luther King School on Putnam Avenue,\nthe King Open/Cambridge Street Upper School and Community Complex, and the\nFoundry Project.  \n  \n  \n  \n\nWhat are some of the pros and cons of using the CMaR method?  \n  \nPros:\n\n\u00b7 The selection of the CMaR through an RFQ process allows the City to better\ndefine the specific requirements the City is looking for in a CMaR firm. The\nsubmission of defined company qualifications the presentation of these\nqualifications by the CMaR team to a selection committee allows for a better\ninteraction of questions and answers to best determine the most qualified CMaR\nfor the project.\n\n\u00b7 The selection is based upon qualifications and experience relative to\nspecific City requirements, not the lowest price. The CMaR is selected, rather\nthan awarded due to the lowest bid. The working relationship between the CMaR,\nthe Owner and the architect is enhanced due to a working relationship that is\ndeveloped during the process leading up to the establishment of the GMP.\n\n\u00b7 The CMaR is directly involved with the selection and management of the scope\nof work for the filed sub-bid trades. Because the CMaR takes the lead in\ndefining the peripheral scope of work for staging, lifts, temporary lighting,\nmiscellaneous patching, fire stopping, etc., scope of work disputes (a cost to\nthe owner if they have merit) are minimized and this coordination places\nresponsibility directly with the CMaR as the responsible party for defining\neach sub-bidders\u2019 drawings and specifications.\n\n\u00b7 The CMaR provides pre-construction services, which aids the City\u2019s project\nteam with scheduling, budgeting, value engineering, phasing strategies, and\nconstructability reviews.\n\n\u00b7 With the CMaR Method, early bid packages for demolition and abatement of\nhazardous materials can run concurrently while the project design is being\nfinalized.\n\n\u00b7 The potential for change orders that occur as the result of gaps in the\nscopes of work as defined by the Architect is reduced because the CMaR is\nparticipating in the delineation of the scope of work during the pre-\nconstruction services.\n\n\u00b7 If the City and the selected CMaR to not come to an agreement as to the GMP,\nthen the City has the option of bidding the project.\n\nCons:\n\n\u00b7 The CMaR Method reduces the risk for the CMaR contractor as he/she is\ninvolved early in the schematic design process. The CMaR\u2019s risk is mitigated\nby his/her early involvement during the design phase and his/her contingency\nthat is established as part of the GMP.  \n\nThe CMaR Method reduces conflict risk between the City and the CMaR firm but\nthat risk is minimized with an overall increased cost at the time the GMP is\nestablished.  \n  \nWhat is the timeline for the CMaR Method?  \n  \nThe first step is the CMaR Method is submission of an application to the IG.\nThe IG\u2019s response for approval or denial of the application is due in 60 days.  \n  \nSubmission in January 2019 would place the IG approval in March 2019. This\ncoincides with Phase 2 Feasibility Study prepared by HMFH Architects,\nsubmitted to the City in October 2018. After the Feasibility Study\nrecommendations are accepted by the City, HMFH shall prepare a fee for the\ndesign services for the City Hall renovations. HMFH is also preparing a Master\nPlan to inform the City which City Departments should be relocated into a\nrenovated or new building on the present location of 831 Massachusetts Avenue\nand the vacant house located at 3 Bigelow Street.  \n  \nGetting a Construction Manager involved with both Phases of this project in\nthe early stages of design will help inform HMFH Architects of construction\nmethods, logistics and costs. Including their input in the design process will\nhelp expedite the construction schedule and mitigate potential cost overruns.  \n  \nI look forward to answering any questions you may have about the application\nand the CMAR Method that we propose to use for this project.\n\n"

            "aceladescription": "Attached is a draft zoning petition concerning the regulation of cannabis\nestablishments in the City of Cambridge in response to Awaiting Report Item\nNumber 18-75. It includes proposed zoning for cannabis retail stores and\ncannabis production facilities, including small cultivation and/or\nmanufacturing establishments. This proposal would amend the current zoning\nprovisions for medical marijuana dispensaries and establish a system of rules\nfor establishments trading in cannabis for medical use, non-medical use, or\nboth. It would also clarify how cannabis research and testing facilities would\nbe classified under current land use regulations.\n\nThis draft zoning petition has been informed by discussions that have taken\nplace over the past several months at the City Council and its Public Safety\nCommittee, Neighborhood and Long-Term Planning Committee, and Economic\nDevelopment and University Relations Committee. For example, the draft zoning\npetition proposes more flexible zoning allowances for Economic Empowerment\nApplicants, as certified by the state, who promote economic development in\nareas that have had historically high rates of arrest, conviction, and\nincarceration related to marijuana crimes. The draft zoning petition also\nproposes criteria to promote the continued availability of products to\nregistered medical marijuana patients. Items that might be subject to further\nconsideration have been identified through annotations.  \n  \nThis draft zoning petition was prepared with the participation of several\ndepartments, including the Law Department, Community Development Department,\nPublic Health Department, Inspectional Services Department, Police Department,\nTraffic, Parking and Transportation Department, and Department of Weights and\nMeasures.  \n  \nAs requested in Awaiting Report 18-75, the attached draft zoning petition\nincorporates what we consider best practices for zoning regulation of adult\nuse cannabis. In addition to zoning, other issues related to cannabis\nestablishments will be discussed in the future through the process of\ninstituting Host Community Agreements, which are required by state\nregulations. As economic development practices are considered, we will\nincorporate equity practices and benefits for Cambridge residents as a\ncomponent of Host Community Agreements to the greatest extent possible.  \n  \nI am requesting that the Council accept this draft as a City Council zoning\npetition and refer that petition to the Planning Board and Ordinance\nCommittee, which will begin the formal hearing process. The specifics of the\nproposal will undergo further review and consideration at these hearings, and\nmay be amended by the City Council prior to being considered for adoption.\n\n"

            "aceladescription": "Pursuant to Council Orders issued on 9/17/18 following the 8/13/18 Ordinance\nCommittee Meeting, City staff have made the below-referenced proposed\nrevisions to the draft Surveillance Ordinance following the 8/13/18 Ordinance\nCommittee hearing.  \n  \nThese proposed revisions to the draft Ordinance were made with the view in\nmind of considering all of the suggestions/proposed revisions from Mayor\nMcGovern, Councilor Kelley, other members of the City Council, and comments\nsubmitted by the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts (the \u201cACLU\u201d)\nand members of the public. After giving careful consideration to all of the\nproposed revisions, City staff recommend making additional proposed changes to\nthe draft Ordinance are as follows:\n\n1. In order to accomplish gender neutrality, references to his/her and other such gender specific pronouns throughout the draft Ordinance have been removed and replaced with the name of the Office/Officer (i.e., City Manager, Police Commissioner, etc.), rather than a pronoun. \n\n2. The definitions section (Section 2.128.020) has been streamlined by removing lists of requirements, i.e., Annual Surveillance Report, Surveillance Technology Impact Report, Surveillance Use Policy, and Technology-Specific Surveillance Use Policy, and including those requirements in the respective sections of the draft Ordinance governing submission of such reports to the City Council, i.e., Sections 2.128.030(C) and (D), 2.128.050(B), and 2.128.060(B). \n\n3. The exceptions and exemptions previously included within the definition of Surveillance Technology in Section 2.128.020(B) of the draft Ordinance have been moved to Section 2.128.070, which relates only to exceptions and exemptions. \n\n4. In order to limit the use of Surveillance Technology in Exigent Circumstances by the Police Department, Section 2.178.040 has been revised to read \u201cfor a period not to exceed 90 days.\u201d This means that for each time the Police Commissioner seeks to use Surveillance Technology in Exigent Circumstances, the use cannot exceed 90 days without getting Council approval. Section 2.128.030 (A) has also been revised to make clear that only the Police Department may use Surveillance Technology in Exigent Circumstances.\n\n5. The sentence \u201cTo the extent the City Manager determines that approving or disapproving the Surveillance Use Policy would unlawfully obstruct the investigative or prosecutorial functions of the Police Department, the City Council shall simply receive and discuss the applicable portions of the Surveillance Use Policy\u201d has been deleted from Section 2.128.050(C) as requested. \n\n6. The phrase \u201cCameras installed in or on a police vehicle\u201d has been removed from the exemptions outlined in Section 2.128.070(3). As a result, the Police Commissioner will have to submit a request for approval in the event the Police Commissioner determines that cameras should be installed in or on police vehicles. \n\n7. The requirement to file a notice with the City Clerk in advance of seeking injunctive relief in court has been removed from Section 2.128.080(B). This means that a person seeking relief for an alleged violation of the Surveillance Ordinance can go directly to court to file an action for injunctive relief.\n\n8. Section 2.128.080(C) has been revised to incorporate by reference the whistleblower protections afforded to Massachusetts public employees under G. L. c. 149, \u00a7 185 (the \u201cMassachusetts Whistleblower Act\u201d) in order to address the request to have whistleblower protections in the draft Ordinance.   \n\nI am very pleased to submit the enclosed draft Ordinance to the City Council.\nThe draft Ordinance before you is the culmination of diligent work over the\npast several years by the City Council, City staff, representatives of the\nACLU and members of the public who worked collaboratively to revise the\nprovisions of the draft Ordinance consistent with feedback from members of the\nCity Council, submissions from the ACLU, and public comments at various\nCouncil meetings and Committee hearings. I believe the above-referenced\nrevisions appropriately address the City Council\u2019s concerns, and comments\nsubmitted by the ACLU and members of the public at the 8/13/18 Ordinance\nCommittee hearing and throughout this several-year long process, and I am\nproud to recommend ordination of this version of the draft Ordinance.\n\n"

Refusal of a\nPerformer to allow such inspection may result in revocation of the Permit;\n\n\u00b7 the proposed amendment to Subsection 12.16.170(G)((1)(a) prohibits\nPerformances from interfering with uses authorized through park permits,\nspecial events permits or with the regular use of playgrounds, and expands the\nprohibition of performances within 100 feet of churches while in session to\ninclude other houses of worship such as synagogues, temples, and mosques;\n\n\u00b7 in Subsection 12.16.170(G)(2), the times permitted for performances in the\narea of the intersection of JFK Street and Mount Auburn Street (Winthrop Park)\nhave been amended, and the prohibition of performances in Quincy Park and\nCentral Square in 12.16.170(H)(1)(b) and (c) have been removed; and\n\n\u00b7 a new provision would provide that the Arts Council has the authority to\npromulgate rules and regulations not inconsistent with the provisions of the\nOrdinance under Subsection 12.16.170(J).\n\nThese proposed amendments address the aspirations and concerns expressed\nthroughout the multi-year review of the Street Performers Ordinance and I\nbelieve will achieve the desired goals of making street performing/busking\nmore accessible and affordable, while at the same time providing for a more\nefficient permitting process. Please note that members of the street\nperforming/busing community and Community Arts Advocates have indicated to the\nArts Council and the City Council that they support charging Permit fees, as\nthey believe that charging such permit fees helps to retain the integrity of\nthe Street Performers Ordinance and encourage compliance with the Ordinance.\nThe street performing community and Community Arts Advocates support the Arts\nCouncil\u2019s recommendation to reduce the fees for Permits; however, these groups\nbelieve that the City should not abolish fees altogether. Moreover, the\nimposition of fees for this permitting scheme offset the expense to the Arts\nCouncil and the City in administering the Street Performers Ordinance.\n\nPlease note that the Arts Council issues Permits for performances on a\ncalendar-year basis and therefore new Permits for calendar year 2019 will soon\nhave to be issued. In order for the Arts Council staff to be able to timely\nincorporate any changes to its licensing scheme into the 2019 permits, the\nCouncil would need to act on these amendments before the end of this calendar\nyear.\n\n"

DePasquale, City Manager, relative to an agreement with the Cambridge Housing Authority to take an easement and accepting the conveyance of a 2nd easement for the purpose of constructing a multi-use path along the Grand Junction Railway and to provide grant funding to assist in closing the funding gap for the Millers River Redevelopment Project by paying for part of the demolition of the community center building, reconstruction of a new community building, renovation of 15 housing units and the creation of permanent affordability restrictions for these units.",
            "aceladescription": "Development and preservation of affordable housing for a wide spectrum of the\npopulation is a top priority of the City Council. So is making it easy for\npeople to move safely through the City, especially by sustainable modes of\ntransportation. Over the past six months, the City and the Cambridge Housing\nAuthority (CHA) have been working collaboratively to develop a plan at the\nMiller\u2019s River Apartments site that would allow us to achieve both of these\nimportant community goals.\n\nI am pleased to report that we have agreed upon a plan that would allow the\nCHA\u2019s redevelopment and modernization of 300 units of housing for elderly and\ndisabled residents at Miller\u2019s River Apartments to include the creation of a\nbrand new building that will house a community room (the Project), while\nallowing the City to acquire and maintain a 10-foot wide easement of 4,820\nsquare feet to accommodate a public multi-use path for the Grand Junction\nGreenway.\n\n\u00b7 CHA will provide the City with 10-foot wide easement areas totaling 4,820\nsquare feet adjacent to the Grand Junction Railway Line in order to construct\nand maintain a public multi-use path for the Grand Junction Greenway. The\n10-foot wide easement areas will provide the minimum width required for a\npublic multi-use path. These easement areas will consist of an easement of\n4,600 square feet that will be taken from the CHA in an eminent domain\nproceeding by the City as a \u201cfriendly\u201d taking for which the CHA has agreed\nthat the City will pay only the statutory pro tanto amount of damages\n(\u201cEasement A\u201d), and an easement of 220 square feet that will be conveyed by\nthe CHA to the City for no compensation (\u201cEasement B\u201d) (collectively the\n\u201cEasements\u201d). While the easement width of 10-foot is less than initially\nrequested, it reduces the impact to current plans and future development\npotential on the Millers River site. The City will continue to work with\nMassDOT and attempt to acquire additional easements in the right-of-way on\nstate property to create a more generous pathway cross-section and buffers.\n\n\u00b7 The City will provide a total of $5,000,000 to CHA which will 1) provide\ngrant funds in order to demolish the existing community building and assist in\nfunding renovations on 15 affordable housing units and allow CHA to close the\nfunding gap that currently would prevent the CHA from completing the Project\nas planned, and 2) to allow the City to acquire the Easement at the Millers\nRiver parcel for future construction and maintenance of a public multi-use\npath.\n\n\u00b7 The existing Miller\u2019s River community building, which blocks the Greenway,\nwill be demolished and a new building housing the community room will be\ncreated. The new building housing the community room would be closer to the\nresidential building, and more convenient for residents. Receipt of City\nfunding for demolition is critical for this element of the plan to proceed. In\naddition, the provision of these grant funds will allow the CHA to fully fund\nplanned renovations and will be used to ensure permanent affordability for 15\nhousing units.\n\n\u00b7 CHA can immediately proceed with its highest priority at the site -- the\nrenovations of Millers River Apartments, allowing it to close with funders on\nschedule keeping in place the project\u2019s tax credit and Section 8 funding\ncommitments.\n\nThe CHA has committed to accepting the pro tanto damage award in the amount of\nOne Million Four Hundred Twenty-Four Thousand Three Hundred Fifty Dollars and\nSeventy Cents ($1,424,350.70) (the Damage Award\u201d) from the City of Cambridge\n(the \u201cCity\u201d) for the taking by eminent domain of Easement A. In connection\nwith the taking of Easement A, the CHA (including its affiliated entities) has\nsigned a release indicating that it will not seek additional monetary damages\nrelated to the taking of Easement A and has also confirmed in writing that the\nCHA will waive the statutory requirement that the City obtain and file an\nappraisal for the value of Easement A prior to the taking of Easement A. The\nCHA has also committed to granting Easement B to the City for no compensation\nwhatsoever.\n\nIn addition to agreeing to the City\u2019s payment of the pro tanto damage award to\nthe CHA for the acquisition of Easement A and agreeing not to seek any\nadditional damages for that taking and to granting Easement B for no\ncompensation, the CHA has confirmed that the grant funds provided by the City\nshall be used exclusively for the purpose of facilitating the development and\nrehabilitation of the affordable housing units at Millers River, specifically,\nfor the demolition of the building that currently houses the community room\nand the renovations of fifteen units at Millers River that will be permanently\nmaintained as affordable housing units.\n\nI have attached a letter from the CHA confirming the above commitments in\nsupport of this project.\n\nI therefore recommend that the City Council take Easement A pursuant to its\neminent domain powers and accept the conveyance of Easement B for the purpose\nof creating a public multi-use path.\n\nAccordingly, I attach for the City Council\u2019s consideration and request that\nthe City Council take the following actions on the below items:\n\n1\\. An Order of Taking to acquire Easement A by eminent domain;\n\n2\\. An appropriation of $1,424,350.70 from Free Cash to the General Fund Law\nDepartment Travel & Training (Judgment & Damages) Account in order to fund the\nacquisition of Easement A by eminent domain;\n\n3\\. An appropriation of $3,575,649.30 from Free Cash to the Public Investment\nFund Community Development Department Extraordinary Expenditures Account to\nprovide Grant Funds to be used pursuant to a Grant agreement to be executed\nbetween the City and the CHA to support the CHA\u2019s demolition of the building\nthat currently houses the Millers River community room and rehabilitation of\nand commitment to the permanent affordability of fifteen housing units within\nthe Miller\u2019s River Apartments; and\n\n4\\. Vote by simple majority to accept the granting of Easement B by the CHA to\nthe City for no compensation.\n\nI am happy to answer any questions you may have about this matter.\n\n"

The Plan did not include technical studies\nto evaluate space and operational constraints for each street segment to\ndetermine the feasibility of creating separated facilities in the short term.\nIt also did not include a phasing plan or timeframe for completion of the\noverall network as the intent of the Plan was for it to be used as a guide and\nreference for projects undertaken, particularly projects that are part of the\nCity\u2019s Five-Year Sidewalk and Street Reconstruction Plan. The proposed update\nwill expand on prior work by including a feasibility analysis and will create\na more detailed implementation framework.  \n  \nThe Community Development Department will lead a public process to update the\nPlan, in coordination with other departments including Traffic, Parking &\nTransportation, Public Works, and Public Health. We expect that an update to\nthe Plan will have positive results for all as the bicycle network vision\nfollows three guiding principles: safety, comfort, and connection.  \n  \nThe update will:  \n\n\u00b7 Incorporate information related to Vision Zero policies into the Plan.\n\n\u00b7 Update the network vision to incorporate recently constructed bicycle\nfacilities.\n\n\u00b7 Create a feasibility assessment and implementation framework for the\nnetwork, with short, medium and long-range plans.\n\n\u00b7 Use of digital tools to help visualize and explore new street design\nconcepts and provide easy to understand plans for feedback\n\n\u00b7 Identify street segments that can be implemented under \u201cquick build\u201d\nscenarios, along with cost estimates for implementation.\n\n\u00b7 Identify projects that are feasible to be implemented through the Five Year\nSidewalk and Street Reconstruction Plan, or as part of a longer-term capital\nproject.\n\n\u00b7 Modify the network plan and develop alternatives where feasibility\nlimitations exist in the current Plan.\n\n\u00b7 Create a section on prioritization and evaluation methods, which will\ninclude metrics for the City to track progress toward plan goals, in line with\nthose identified in the Envision Cambridge mobility recommendations.\n\n  \nWe anticipate that work will begin early in 2019, with a time frame of\napproximately 12-18 months. Implementation of bike facilities to develop a\nconnected network will continue during the process, at locations such as South\nMass Ave, Inman Square, Ames Street, River Street, O\u2019Brien Highway. In\naddition, we will continue to advance off-road facilities including the Grand\nJunction Corridor and the Cambridge-Watertown Greenway.\n\n"

The location features off street\nparking and onsite maintenance staff. While the location is convenient for\nyouth and special needs programs nearby, the park is also intended to serve as\na citywide attraction with the potential to serve as a national model. A focus\ngroup was recently created and will have their initial meeting after a design\nfirm is selected. The group will then work closely with the design firm and\nthe community through a comprehensive public process to develop program\nconcepts.  \n  \nWe expect to issue an RFP for a design firm in November with the public design\nprocess beginning this winter.

            "aceladescription": "I hereby request the appropriation of $5,000,000 from the Community Benefits\nStabilization Fund to the Grant Fund Human Services Other Ordinary Maintenance\naccount to be used: (1) for grant agreements with nonprofit organizations to\naddress the City\u2019s most pressing service needs, and (2) to enter into a\ncontract with a Project Evaluator to work with the grant recipients as well as\nthe Community Benefits Advisory Committee (CBAC), which is overseeing this\neffort.\n\nBackground\n\nSince 2010, over $20 million in mitigation funds designated for community\nbenefits purposes have been pledged to the City of Cambridge (the \u201cCity\u201d) as a\nresult of zoning amendments and special permit requirements, of which $7.4\nmillion has been received and transferred to the City to the Community\nBenefits Stabilization Fund to date. A detailed timeframe for the additional\nfunds (beyond the $7.4 million) is not known at this time.\n\nPrior to the formation of the CBAC by ordinance (Chapter 2.127 of the\nCambridge Municipal Code), the City, with the advice of a Needs Assessment\nAdvisory Committee and funding support from the Cambridge Community Foundation\n(CCF), conducted a comprehensive needs assessment for an in-depth\nunderstanding of the City\u2019s most pressing needs and service gaps, and to\nenable the City to make informed decisions on the investment of Community\nBenefits Funds. The\n<https://www.cambridgema.gov/CDD/Projects/Planning/cambridgeneedsassessment>\nwas completed in January 2017 and adopted by City Council in May 2017.\n\nCBAC is charged with soliciting and evaluating proposals from local nonprofit\npartnerships for the provision of services to Cambridge residents, and with\nestablishing the rules, regulations and guidelines for the proper\nadministration of community benefits funds. The CBAC\u2019s recommendations are\ninformed by Cambridge City Council\u2019s Guiding Principles for Community Benefits\nFunding (Attachment A), which were originally established by the Ordinance,\nthen adopted and expanded in the Community Needs Assessment. CBAC includes the\ndiverse perspective of residents, representatives from the local nonprofit\ncommunity including the Cambridge Nonprofit Coalition (CNC), businesses, CCF,\nand universities, and works with City staff to make recommendations to the\nCity Manager for the award of Community Benefits Grants.\n\nAll CBAC meetings are open to the public. In addition, while developing the\nfunding approach, the Committee held two (2) Listening Sessions to which the\nnonprofit community was invited to ask questions and give feedback on the\napproach.\n\nAdditional information and resources and the full list of members are\navailable here:\n<https://www.cambridgema.gov/CDD/Projects/Planning/CommunityBenefitsAdvisoryCommittee>\n\nCurrent Phase:\n\nThe CBAC is overseeing a competitive grant process to disseminate the first\nround of Community Benefits funds. The Community Benefits competitive grant\nprocess will occur in two phases: a 6-month Planning Phase; and a 3-year\nImplementation Phase.\n\nUsing the Guiding Principles for Community Benefits Funding and the plan for\nimplementing the Community Benefits process outlined in the Ordinance, this\nprocess is designed to bring nonprofit organizations together in partnerships\nthat can address the three Top Tier Needs identified in the 2017 Community\nNeeds Assessment. The Committee identified as the priority population to be\nserved families with children that are low-income or in poverty, particularly\nthose headed by a single woman (Target Population). The three Top Tier Needs\nare:  \n\n\u00b7 Affordable Housing & Homelessness\n\n\u00b7 Financial Security\n\n\u00b7 Behavioral Health: Mental Health & Substance Abuse\n\nCBAC is prioritizing innovative approaches for the priority population that\nhave the capacity to address all three Top Tier Needs in ways that respond to\nthe unique needs of families, with the recognition that families may be\nimpacted by one or more of the Top Tier needs in different ways.\n\nCBAC recognizes that the Top Tier Needs represent complex and often\ninterrelated issues, and is looking for innovative approaches to the provision\nof services that prioritize partnership and coordination, an integration of\nservices, and a commitment to broader engagement of the community and\navailable resources. CBAC is seeking to fund partnerships that will use the\nfunds to develop creative and innovative approaches that could be new and/or\nthat enhance and add value to what partnering organizations are already doing.\n\nCBAC will select and recommend to the City Manager up to five (5) partnerships\nto receive a 6-month Planning grant from the City. These 6-month Planning\ngrants will provide selected partnerships with up to $30,000 to formulate and\nhone their partnership and proposed approach, culminating in the development\nof a Plan for Implementation. At the completion of the Planning period, CBAC\nwill review submitted Plans for Implementation and select and recommend to the\nCity Manager up to five (5) partnerships to receive a grant for up to $750,000\nper partnership to be distributed over a 3-year Implementation period.\nGrantees must participate in the Planning Phase in order to be eligible for\nthe Implementation Phase, and receipt of a Planning grant does not guarantee\nreceipt of an Implementation grant.\n\nThrough this process, CBAC aims to identify and support promising and\ninnovative models for partnership that can address all three Top Tier Needs in\nthe shorter-term and over time. The focus on the Top Tier Needs does not\npreclude partnerships from addressing other needs identified in the Community\nNeeds Assessment or including services that respond to other pressing needs\namong families that are part of the priority population.\n\nThis process is also designed to inform future rounds of Community Benefits\nfunding.\n\nANTICIPATED TIMELINE\n\n![](/Citizens/GetImage.aspx?Type=25&ID=/Aspose.Words.5f67d2df-a0f9-460d-82a6-eb250d587615.001.png)Planning\nGrant Phase  \n  \n---  \n  \nNovember 2018\n\n|\n\nRelease of Planning Grant RFP; Convene potential applicants on RFP, project\nbackground, relevant data, and Q &A  \n  \nJanuary 2019\n\n|\n\nAdditional convening for potential applicants, before proposals are due  \n  \nFebruary 2019\n\n|\n\nPlanning grant proposals due to CBAC  \n  \nMarch & April 2019\n\n|\n\nPlanning grant proposals reviewed and finalists interviewed  \n  \nMid-April, 2019\n\n|\n\nAnnounce award(s) of no more than five (5) planning grants of up to $30,000\neach  \n  \nMay - November 2019\n\n|\n\nPlanning grant awardees develop Plan for Implementation  \n  \nTIMELINE Implementation Phase (tentative dates)  \n  \n---  \n  \nNovember 2019\n\n|\n\nPlanning grants expire and Plans for Implementation submitted to CBAC  \n  \nDecember 2019 - January 2020\n\n|\n\nPlans for Implementation reviewed and partnerships interviewed by CBAC,\nevaluation team & external review committee  \n  \nFebruary 2020\n\n|\n\nAnnounce award(s) of no more than five (5) implementation grants  \n  \nFebruary 2020 - January 2023\n\n|\n\nPlan implementation and ongoing Evaluation work  \n  \nJanuary 2024 - December 2024\n\n|\n\nEvaluation completion  \n  \nI am pleased with the work of the Community Benefits Advisory Committee and\nurge your approval of the appropriation request in so that the Community\nBenefits funding process can move forward.\n\n"

The cost estimate has\nalso been updated to reflect the less than competitive bidding environment.\nThe risk of any future cost increases is linked to changes in the bidding\nenvironment, unforeseen conditions, and expanded scope.  \n  \nNext steps in the process will include:  \n\n\u00b7 Community meeting #6 in October 2018 to obtain feedback on plaza design and\npublic arts components;\n\n\u00b7 Continued engagement with local businesses and business association to\ndevelop construction mitigation measures;\n\n\u00b7 Completion of the final design documents and advertising the contract for\nconstruction bids in December 2018;\n\n\u00b7 Coordination with private utility companies to upgrade their infrastructure\nin conjunction with our project;\n\n\u00b7 A construction kick-off community meeting in spring 2019;\n\n  \nConstruction is anticipated to begin in spring 2019, and take 18 to 24 months\nto complete.\n\n"

As a result, additional improvements were recommended\nin order to support the current and projected field uses.  \n  \nSome of the renovations and improvements to the facility that were included in\nthe project include:  \n\n\u2022 New and increased fencing and athletic ball netting to improve site security\nand also create safer conditions for all uses as well as for pedestrians and\nspectators on adjacent paths.\n\n\u2022 Pathway resurfacing on adjacent walkways to repair aging asphalt and\nestablish pathways that meet current ADA design standards for slopes and\nsurfacing.\n\n\u2022 Additional ADA compliant spectator seating to support attendance at events.\n\n\u2022 12 trees around the project area to provide additional shade in the park\nfacility.\n\n\u2022 Athletic equipment for CRLS field users appropriate for use on the new turf\nsurfacing.\n\n\u2022 Infilled synthetic turf surface on the practice field area to eliminate\nfield down time in wet conditions.\n\n\u2022 Specification of a virgin infill rubber to be utilized on both fields in\ndirect response to community concerns.\n\nConstruction is proceeding according to schedule. The main field was available\nto the high school team for practice beginning August 21, 2018. The field and\nbleachers were ready for the first football home game, September 7th. The full\nproject including the practice fields will be completed in November.  \n  \nThe bid process yielded a highly competitive price from a qualified\ncontractor, but with the added scope the initial appropriation was not\nsufficient to complete the project. Thus, we are respectfully requesting that\n$350,000 be appropriated to the DPW Capital Expenditure Account.\n\n"

            "aceladescription": "Listed below are the recommendations of the Community Preservation Act\nCommittee (CPAC) for FY2019. For additional information, please see\nattachments from the CPA Committee Chair, Lisa Peterson, dated September 17,\n2018.  \n  \nThe CPA process began with a public meeting held on June 13, 2018 to solicit\nsuggestions on CPA projects for FY2019. Based on that meeting and other\ninputs, the CPAC was provided information on project funding requests without\nany recommendations for percentage allocations of anticipated CPA funds. A\npublic hearing was held on July 19, 2018, to solicit recommendations from the\npublic on percentage allocations. The CPAC also received several petitions,\nletters and e-mails along with online project requests from the public\nrelative to CPA recommendations. The CPAC, on September 5, 2018, unanimously\nvoted for an allocation of 80% for Affordable Housing, 10% for Historical\nPreservation Projects and 10% for Open Space Projects.  \n  \nIn accordance with the CPAC\u2019s recommendations, I am requesting that the City\nCouncil appropriate a total of $12,730,000 in CPA funds raised by the City's\nFY2019 CPA surcharge, the FY2018 state match funds received in FY2019 and a\nportion of the existing CPA fund balance.  \n  \nFor this appropriation, it is estimated that the net local receipts from the\nCPA surcharge for FY2019 will total $9,400,000, added to an anticipated FY2018\nstate match of approximately $1,220,000 and an additional $2,100,000 from CPA\nFund Balance.

This appropriation\nrequest was developed in coordination with the Fire Chief, Public Works\nCommissioner and Finance Director.\n\nThe Fire Department is currently working with the Department of Public Works\nto establish a comprehensive deferred maintenance plan across multiple fire\nhouses, for coordination with the Municipal Facilities Improvement Plan (MFIP)\nlarge scale alteration project schedule.\n\nThe MFIP is currently engaged in the following projects with the Fire\nDepartment: Taylor Square roof replacement, HVAC, and lighting upgrades; Fire\nDept. Headquarters roof repair and replacement; Fire Dept. Headquarters\nApparatus Bay ventilation; Engine 3 AC/ventilation upgrade; and a Fire and\nLife Safety project across 13 buildings, including five fire houses.\n\nThe Fire Chief, in collaboration with the Department of Public Works, has\ndesignated priority items for immediate repair which may include: thorough\ncleaning, preparation and painting of interior surfaces within the all fire\nstations, including the walls and ceilings on both the apparatus floor, and\nliving quarters; repair windows, doors, and screens at all fire stations and\nreplace two Palladian wood windows at Fire Department Headquarters; provide\nair conditioning using both \u201cDuctless Mini Split\u201d units or replacement of\nexisting window air conditioning units until proper HVAC installation can be\naccomplished long-term; replace bathroom fixtures; provide operable cooktop\nventilation, replace appliances and other repairs to kitchens; and replace or\nrepair flooring.\n\nThe department has already initiated the purchase of assorted furnishings for\nfirehouses including sofas and mattresses.\n\nIn addition, the City Administration annually reviews its 5-year capital and\nbonding plan. This ongoing review will include the possibility of providing\nfunding for major renovations to our fire facilities in concert with the\nrepairs scheduled for the Taylor Square Fire Station and repairs included in\nthe Municipal Facilities Improvement Plan (MFIP) as noted above.\n\nMajor repairs to any City Building presents challenges, including the\ntemporary relocation of employees and services. Major Renovations to a Fire\nStation adds another level of complexity in siting a temporary location due to\nthe geographic requirements of providing fire services in a timely manner.\n\nI believe this appropriation request addresses policy Order 2018-154 adopted\nby the City Council last week. As we proceed through the process of executing\nthese repairs, we will continue to evaluate short-term needs.\n\n"

Vellucci Community\nPlaza (\u201cVellucci Plaza\u201d).\n\nSpecifically, relief is required from the Legislature in order to perform\nconstruction work on Vellucci Plaza, which is located immediately to the west\nof the intersection of Hampshire Street and Cambridge Street. The January 21,\n1980 City Council order authorizing the City to take the land making up\nVellucci Plaza by way of eminent domain states that said land is to be used\nfor \u201crecreation open space purposes . . . .\u201d To make up for the loss of public\nrecreational open space that will result from this construction work, nearby\nland on the opposite side of Hampshire Street owned by the City will be\ndedicated as public recreational open space as part of a \u201cnew\u201d Vellucci Plaza\nand thus, there will not be a net loss of land dedicated for this purpose.\n\nPursuant to Article 97 of the Articles of Amendment to the Constitution of the\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts (\u201cArticle 97\u201d), land that is held and dedicated\nfor public open space and recreational uses may only be re-used for another\nuse with the consent of two thirds of both houses of the Legislature.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n1. Mayor Alfred E. Vellucci Community Plaza\n\nAs noted above, the City acquired the land that makes up Vellucci Plaza by way\nof an eminent domain taking on January 21, 1980. The City Council order\nauthorizing the taking states, in pertinent part:\n\n[T]he City of Cambridge by its City Council does hereby take the land\nhereinafter described for recreation open space purposes and all easements,\nprivileges and appurtenances thereto belonging as well as all trees and all\nstructures thereon. . . . The taking of fee simple title in land herein\ndescribed is hereby authorized in accordance with General Laws, Chapter 40,\nSection 14 and Chapter 43, Section 30 as amended for the purpose of public\nrecreation open space.\n\nVellucci Plaza is the primary public open space in Inman Square, with a total\narea of 6,480 square feet. Vellucci Plaza is adjacent to residential\nproperties, and consists primarily of hardscape elements. The current design\nof Vellucci Plaza dates to 2006, when it was reconstructed as part of the\nlarger Cambridge Street Improvements project.\n\nAs part of the community outreach for the Project, an online and email survey\nwas conducted which included questions about the current design and use of\nVellucci Plaza. Public input on Vellucci Plaza was also solicited at public\nmeetings. There appears to be a clear consensus (350 of 441 survey responses\nreceived) that Vellucci Plaza should not \u201cstay the way it is today.\u201d Survey\nrespondents generally indicated that Vellucci Plaza was not inviting and did\nnot work well, in large part due to its physical isolation and disconnection\nfrom the retail activity of Inman Square (Vellucci Plaza is located on the\nonly corner of Inman Square that does not allow for direct pedestrian access\nto retail).\n\n2. Inman Square Intersection Safety Improvements Project and Existing Operational and Safety Issues\n\nThe City initiated the Project in October, 2016. The purpose of the Project is\nto design and construct permanent physical improvements to Inman Square, which\nwill address long-standing safety and operational issues. The Project is an\noutgrowth of several other studies which have been made of Inman Square in\nrecent years, including studies by the City, and by the Massachusetts\nDepartment of Transportation in conjunction with regional pedestrian and\nbicycle advocacy groups.\n\nThe oblique intersection of Cambridge Street and Hampshire Street (which are\ntwo major arterial streets) contributes to operational and safety issues that\nhave been exacerbated over the years as user volumes have increased. Conflicts\nbetween modes of transportation are of particular concern, given that Inman\nSquare is the location of some of the highest bicycle volumes in the City\n(approximately 600 cyclists traverse Inman Square during a typical weekday\npeak hour). In addition, over 1,000 pedestrians cross the streets near Inman\nSquare during peak hours.\n\nThe unusually large size of this intersection results in long signal cycle\nlengths, and lengthy delays for all users. Crosswalks are extremely long,\nwhich increases the exposure of pedestrians and cyclists to vehicle conflicts.\nThe large number of potential turning movements resulting from Inman Square\u2019s\nseven entry/exit points, as well as parking maneuvers, also present many\nopportunities for conflicts between users.\n\nInman Square has been identified as one of the top 200 high crash locations in\nthe Commonwealth, with a crash rate roughly double the statewide average for a\nsignalized intersection. In addition, a high proportion of crashes in Inman\nSquare involve pedestrians and cyclists, increasing the incidence of personal\ninjury. Analysis of the types of crashes in Inman Square indicate that the\nphysical configuration of the intersection of Hampshire Street and Cambridge\nStreet is a significant contributing factor to incidents that occur there.\n\nBecause of the above factors, the City, beginning in 2016, implemented interim\nsafety improvements in Inman Square, including prohibiting left turns and\nenhanced pavement markings for bike lanes, pending the completion of the\ncurrent Project.\n\n3. Proposed Design and Impact on Vellucci Plaza\n\nThe proposed design for the reconfiguration of the intersection of Hampshire\nStreet and Cambridge Street in Inman Square splits the single, unusually\nlarge, intersection into two smaller signalized intersections with more\nconventional geometry, and reallocates some of the existing vehicle space to\npedestrian, bicycle and transit facilities. In addition, the proposed design\nrequires that all vehicular traffic traveling through Inman Square turn and\nthus, increases safety and allows for better balance of the space between\nvehicular and non-vehicular uses. The design reduces the size of the current\nVellucci Plaza, but includes the creation of a \u201cnew\u201d Vellucci Plaza on the\nopposite side of Hampshire Street, adjacent to existing retail uses.\n\nIn terms of usable open space and placemaking opportunities specifically, the\nproposed design is responsive to community opinions that Inman Square\u2019s\nprimary open space should be located as close to retail activities as\npossible. A desire was expressed for a tree-shaded flexible space that could\naccommodate seating, informal outdoor dining, and special events, and have a\nlively feel. The existing Vellucci Plaza site, while somewhat compatible with\nthese activities, was seen as disadvantaged by its location which requires\npedestrians to cross one or more of Inman Square\u2019s major streets in order to\nbe accessed from retail activities.\n\nThe construction work will result in public recreational open space existing\non a portion of the current Vellucci Plaza on the west side of Hampshire\nStreet, as well as new public recreational open space on the east side of\nHampshire Street (i.e., the \u201cnew\u201d Vellucci Plaza). This new public\nrecreational open space specifically responds to the community\u2019s desire for an\nattractive, flexible, open space adjacent to Inman Square\u2019s retail activity.\nThe total area of the two resulting portions of Vellucci Plaza will be 6,480\nsquare feet, which, as noted above, is the total area of the existing Vellucci\nPlaza. Thus, there will not be a net loss of recreational open space as a\nresult of this construction work.\n\nThe City has consulted with members of Mayor Vellucci\u2019s family on the proposed\ndesign, and on May 7, 2018, the Mid-Cambridge Neighborhood Conservation\nDistrict Commission approved the proposed Plaza design.\n\nHOME RULE LEGISLATION\n\nVellucci Plaza is owned and held by the City for public recreational open\nuses, and is therefore protected under Article 97 from any change in use\nabsent legislation authorizing such a change in use. In order to proceed with\nthe design of the Project and reconfiguration of the intersection of Hampshire\nStreet and Cambridge Street and Vellucci Plaza as planned, I ask that the City\nCouncil vote in favor of filing the attached Home Rule Petition.\n\nI have attached for your information a survey plan depicting the proposed\nreconfiguration of the intersection of Hampshire Street and Cambridge Street\nas well as Vellucci Plaza, and site renderings showing the existing and\nproposed site conditions.\n\n"

            "aceladescription": "I am writing to ask for your approval to seek authorization from the\nMassachusetts Office of the Inspector General (the \u201cIG\u201d) for the City to use\nthe Construction Manager at Rick (\u201cCMAR\u201d) procurement and construction method\n(the CMAR Method\u201d) in connection with the redevelopment of the Foundry\nbuilding. By way of background, in 2004, the Massachusetts Legislature passed\nconstruction reform legislation that allowed Massachusetts public agencies and\nmunicipalities to use the CMAR Method for the first time. The CMAR Method has\nbeen commonly used by the private sector for some time, and is an alternative\nto the design-bid-build approach used under M.G.L. c. 149. Since the\nlegislation was enacted, many public entities have successfully applied for,\nand are using the CMAR method.\n\nThe Office of the Inspector General has promulgated a set of procedures for\nusing the CMAR Method. Once a public agency or municipality\u2019s (hereafter\n\u201cMunicipality\u201d) governing body authorizes the use of the CMAR Method, the\nMunicipality submits an application to the IG, from whom the Municipality\u2019s\nawarding authority must obtain a notice to proceed in order to use the CMAR\nMethod. The application requires that the municipality demonstrate the\nfollowing:\n\na: The Municipality has authorization from its governing body to enter into a\ncontract with a CMAR firm.\n\nb: The Municipality has the capacity and a plan and procedure that is in place\nand approved of by the governing body, where appropriate, to effectively\nprocure and manage CMAR services for the specific project, and has retained\nthe services of a qualified owner\u2019s project manager.\n\nc: The Municipality has procedures in place to ensure fairness in competition,\nevaluation and reporting of results at every stage in the procurement process.\n\nd: The building project has an estimated construction value of $5,000,000.00\nor more.\n\ne: The Municipality has determined that the use of the CMAR method is\nappropriate for the building project and states the reasons in writing the\nreasons for the determination.\n\nThis memorandum is intended to summarize the definition, advantages, and\nprocess governing the use of the CMAR method in support of my seeking City\nCouncil approval to utilize this construction method for the Foundry project.\nMy submission of this memorandum to you is the first step in satisfying the\nabove referenced requirements for seeking approval to use the CMAR Method for\nthe Foundry and will answer the following questions:\n\n\u00b7 What is CMAR?\n\n\u00b7 What procurement and construction methods has the City used for vertical\nconstruction projects in the past?\n\n\u00b7 What are some of the benefits and risks of using the CMAR Method?\n\n\u00b7 What is the timeline for the CMAR Method?\n\nWhat is Construction Management at Risk (CMAR)?\n\nThe CMAR is selected through a competitive procurement based on qualifications\nand price. The City will procure the CMAR via a two-step Request for\nQualifications (\u201cRFQ\u201d) and Request for Proposal (\u201cRFP\u201d) process.\n\nThe type of contract the City will enter into with the CMAR is a cost plus\nfixed fee amount with a Guaranteed Maximum Price (\u201cGMP\u201d). The GMP is the sum\nof the CMAR fee, and the costs associated with the CMAR\u2019s general conditions\nfor construction, all of the filed sub bid trade contractors, the CMAR\nestimates for any un-bid subcontractors at the time of the establishment of\nthe GMP, and includes the CMAR\u2019s contingency. The CMAR agrees to pay for costs\nthat exceed the GMP that are not the result of changes in the contract\ndocuments. This is one of the reasons a CMAR is selected prior to the plans\nand specifications being completed. The CMAR works with the owner and the\narchitect to develop the scope delineated in the contract documents as part of\nthe team.\n\nThe fixed fee is a percentage of the cost of the work and is submitted by the\nCMAR during the selection process based upon an estimated cost of\nconstruction. The CMAR\u2019s contingency belongs to the CMAR if it is needed, but\nis turned over to the City if not used. The contingency is a line item within\nthe GMP and is used to incorporate missing items undefined at the time the GMP\nis established that arise during the project.\n\nBy law, the GMP cannot be established until the drawings and specifications\nare at a minimum of 60% complete. The closer the documents are to being 100%\ncomplete, the less the CMAR\u2019s contingency line item is. The Owner\u2019s\ncontingency is for owner-directed changes or unforeseen conditions unknown at\nthe time the GMP is established. The CMAR\u2019s contingency is included in the\nGMP; the owner\u2019s contingency is outside of the GMP.\n\nThe City Manager\u2019s project management staff will work closely with the City\u2019s\nArchitect, consultants and CMAR to determine the appropriate contingencies.\n\nWhat procurement and construction methods has the City used for vertical\nconstruction projects in the past?\n\nThe City has used M.G.L. c. 149 in the past as the bidding process for\nvertical construction. This process, also defined as \u201cdesign-bid-build\u201d,\nrequires all of the construction bid packages to be available only after 100%\ncompletion of the design documents. Under this traditional approach, the\nlowest responsible and eligible bidder is awarded the project.\n\nWhat are some of the pros and cons of using the CMAR method?\n\nPros:\n\n\u00b7 The selection of the CMAR through an RFQ process allows the City to better\ndefine the specific requirements the City is looking for in a CMAR firm. The\nsubmission of defined company qualifications the presentation of these\nqualifications by the CMAR team to a selection committee allows for a better\ninteraction of questions and answers to best determine the most qualified CMAR\nfor the project.\n\n\u00b7 The selection is based upon qualifications and experience relative to\nspecific City requirements, not the lowest price. The CMAR is selected, rather\nthan awarded due to the lowest bid. The working relationship between the CMAR,\nthe Owner and the architect is enhanced due to a working relationship that is\ndeveloped during the process leading up to the establishment of the GMP.\n\n\u00b7 The CMAR is directly involved with the selection and management of the scope\nof work for the filed sub-bid trades. Because the CMAR takes the lead in\ndefining the peripheral scope of work for staging, lifts, temporary lighting,\nmiscellaneous patching, fire stopping, etc., scope of work disputes (a cost to\nthe owner if they have merit) are minimized and this coordination places\nresponsibility directly with the CMAR as the responsible party for defining\neach sub-bidders\u2019 drawings and specifications.\n\n\u00b7 The CMAR provides pre-construction services, which aids the City\u2019s project\nteam with scheduling, budgeting, value engineering, phasing strategies, and\nconstructability reviews.\n\n\u25cf With the CMAR Method, early bid packages for demolition and abatement of\nhazardous materials can run concurrent while the project design is being\nfinalized.\n\n\u00b7 The potential for change orders that occur as the result of gaps in the\nscopes of work as defined by the Architect is reduced because the CMAR is\nparticipating in the delineation of the scope of work during the pre-\nconstruction services.\n\n\u00b7 If the City and the selected CMAR to not come to an agreement as to the GMP,\nthen the City has the option of bidding the project.\n\nCons:\n\n\u00b7 The CMAR Method reduces the risk for the CMAR contractor as he/she is\ninvolved early in the schematic design process. The CMAR\u2019s risk is mitigated\nby his/her early involvement during the design phase and his/her contingency\nthat is established as part of the GMP.\n\n\u00b7 The CMAR Method reduces conflict risk between the City and the CMAR firm as\nthat risk is minimized with an overall increased cost at the time the GMP is\nestablished.\n\nWhat is the timeline for the CMAR Method?\n\nThe first step is the CMAR Method is submission of an application to the IG.\nThe IG\u2019s response for approval or denial of the application is due in 60 days.\n\nSubmission of the City\u2019s application to the IG in May would mean that the IG\u2019s\napproval or denial would be expected in July. This timing would coincide with\nthe programming and feasibility study presently under way by the architect\nCambridge Seven Associates, Inc. The architect is scheduled to submit its\nfeasibility study and findings to the City in September of 2018.\n\nPresently there is an assumption that some form of demolition of the Foundry\nbuilding\u2019s structure and removal of hazardous materials from within the\nbuilding shall be required. The CMAR process would allow for this demolition\nand abatement to occur in late spring of 2019 while the bid documents for the\nbalance of the project are being prepared.\n\nI look forward to answering any questions you may have about the application\nand the CMAR Method that we propose to use for the redevelopment of the\nFoundry.\n\n"

            "aceladescription": "I am writing to seek your approval with regard to a request the City of\nCambridge has received from BMR-21 Erie Street, LLC (\u201cBMR\u201d) for an aerial\nlicense for a structural canopy to be constructed over a portion of the public\nsidewalk in front of property located at 21 Erie Street. The canopy structure\nand building address signage letters mounted on top of the canopy will\noverhang a portion of the City-owned sidewalk along Erie Street and along\nBMR\u2019s property located at 21 Erie Street. There will be no illuminated signs\ninstalled on the canopy structure.  \n  \nThe license area in which the proposed canopy will be constructed will have a\nwidth of 14.00 feet (parallel to the public way), a length of 3.40 feet\n(projecting into the public way) and a height of 12.50 feet high (as measured\nfrom the sidewalk). As the requested license area is slightly larger than the\nproposed dimensions of the canopy and sign, allowing for a construction\n\u201cfactor of safety,\u201d the bottom of the canopy is designed to measure 10\u2019-4\u2019\u2019\nabove the sidewalk, and the canopy and building address letters are designed\nto have a combined height of 2\u20190,\u2019\u2019 to be constructed within the proposed\n12.50 foot height of the license area. The total weight of the canopy\nstructure and building address sign is estimated at 1,550 lbs. The total\nrequested license area is five hundred and ninety-five cubic feet (595 cu.\nft). The requested license area is depicted in the \u201cLicense Plan of Land\u201d\nattached hereto. In addition to the License Plan of Land, BMR has provided the\nfollowing documents: (i) a color rendering of the design of the proposed\ncanopy; (ii) a color photograph of the existing canopy proposed to be removed;\n(iii) a plan/drawing of the proposed canopy; and (iv) a plan/drawing showing\nthe sign dimensions. All of these documents and plans are attached hereto for\nyour consideration and approval. The Director of Assessing has determined the\nannual fee for Fiscal Year 2018 shall be $500.  \n  \nIn accordance with the Cambridge Municipal Code, the plans and renderings have\nbeen reviewed by various City departments (Police, Fire, Water, Community\nDevelopment, Public Works (including the City Engineer), Electrical, and\nTraffic, Parking and Transportation). I deemed it appropriate to transmit this\nlicense request to the City Council for its consideration pursuant to Section\n12.12.200, which allows for maintenance over the public way of a structural\ncanopy when a permit therefor has been authorized by the City Council. I\nbelieve that the information furnished in this letter is sufficient to enable\nthe City Council to make a determination on this matter.  \n  \nI recommend that the City Council vote to authorize me to grant a license, in\nsuch form and substance as I deem appropriate, for the installation of a\nstructural canopy at this location.\n\n"

DePasquale, City Manager, relative to the appropriation of $5 million from Fund Free Cash to the Public Investment Fund Executive Department Extraordinary Expenditures account, for the City\u2019s first contribution to the GLX project.",
            "aceladescription": "I am hereby requesting an appropriation of $5 million from Free Cash to the\nPublic Investment Fund Executive Department Extraordinary Expenditures\naccount, for the City\u2019s first contribution to the GLX project.  \n  \nThe Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) and the Massachusetts\nDepartment of Transportation (MassDOT) have been working for many years to\nadvance the Green Line Extension (GLX) project from planning to design, and\nthen into construction and operation. This project will extend the Green Line\nfrom its current terminal at Lechmere to serve seven new stations in\nCambridge, Somerville, and Medford. From the Cambridge perspective, the\nprincipal benefits of this extension include the following:  \n\n\u00b7 Construction of a new Lechmere Station to replace the current facility,\nwhich is obsolete, in poor condition, and not fully accessible for those with\ndisabilities.\n\n\u00b7 Creation of frequent and reliable service from sections of Somerville and\nMedford that are currently not easily accessible by public transportation. In\naddition to better serving trips to Boston that pass through Cambridge, the\nGLX will serve trips from these locations into the key employment centers\nlocated in eastern Cambridge.\n\n\u00b7 Assisting in meeting the City\u2019s and the region\u2019s mobility, sustainability,\nand economic development goals.\n\n  \nIn addition, the relocated Lechmere Station enables a number of opportunities\nassociated with the Cambridge Crossing development, including the extension of\nFirst Street across Monsignor O\u2019Brien Highway, the creation of a new\ndevelopment parcel at the current location of Lechmere Station, and general\nimprovements to access the entire site.  \n  \nBased on these multiple benefits, the City of Cambridge has long been\nsupportive of this project, and has pushed the MBTA and MassDOT to move the\nproject expeditiously, despite multiple delays and attempts to cancel the\nproject.  \n  \nIn 2015, after construction on the project had commenced, the Commonwealth\nannounced that the project was significantly over budget, and put construction\non hold, pending a review of the design, cost factors, construction methods,\nand procurement strategy, with the goal of determining whether the project\nshould be moved forward in a modified and less costly manner, or whether it\nshould be cancelled despite the construction work already completed. During\nthis review of the project, Secretary of Transportation Stephanie Pollack made\nit clear that she expected some level of municipal financial contribution to\nthe project, to help offset the cost increases. Although this request was\nunprecedented for a public transportation project in Massachusetts, both the\nCity of Cambridge and the City of Somerville agreed to enter into negotiations\nwith MassDOT in order to help save the GLX as an active project.  \n  \nBased on these negotiations, which also included representatives from\nDivcowest, owners of the Cambridge Crossing (then Northpoint) development,\nCambridge agreed to contribute $25 million dollars to the GLX project, half of\nwhich ($12.5 million) will come from contributions by DivcoWest. At the same\ntime, Somerville agreed to contribute approximately $50 million dollars to the\nproject, recognizing the more substantial benefit that they will realize from\nthe project. The Boston Region Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) also\nagreed to reprogram the $150 million in federal funding originally intended\nfor the next phase GLX extension to State Route 16 to help pay for the current\nproject. Based on these financial commitments, along with changes to the\ndesign to simplify the project and reduce costs, the Commonwealth determined\nthat it would continue to move forward with the project, subject to ongoing\ndiscussions regarding the project scope and budget.  \n  \nThe agreements between the City, MassDOT, and the MBTA were then laid out and\nmemorialized in the attached Project Participation Agreement (PPA), which was\nentered into on December 14, 2016. The PPA also described the various rights\nand responsibilities of the parties, including a schedule of contributions,\nthe milestones that the MBTA and MassDOT must meet, and the procedures for\nrefunding excess municipal contributions. At the City Council meeting on\nSeptember 26, 2016, the City Council authorized the City Manager to enter into\nthis agreement and sign the PPA. A similar agreement was developed with the\nCity of Somerville for their $50 million contribution.  \n  \nSince the signing of the PPA, the MBTA has made significant progress on the\nGLX project, including hiring a new Program Manager and developing a more\ndetailed version of the design that formed the basis for the decision to move\nforward. The MBTA also made a decision to switch to a design-build procurement\nmethod, which should provide a greater degree of cost certainty once the\ncontract is in place. The MBTA then developed and advertised a design-build\nrequest for proposals, and went through an extensive, multi-step process to\nsolicit and evaluate proposals from potential design-build teams. Three\nproposals were received, two of which were below the maximum allowed price and\nwere therefore fully evaluated. On November 20, 2017, the MBTA\u2019s Fiscal and\nManagement Control Board awarded the contract to build the project to a joint\nventure called GLX Constructors, at a contract price of just over $1 billion,\nallowing the project to restart in earnest. In addition, the MBTA has created\nthe GLX Community Working Group (CWG), which will provide a collaborative\nforum for information sharing between the GLX project and external\nstakeholders, including schedules, activities, and potential impacts\nassociated with construction, while also soliciting stakeholder feedback. The\nCWG will include representatives from the City, DivcoWest, and the East\nCambridge Business Association.  \n  \nAs laid out in the PPA, the first Cambridge contribution for the GLX project\nis due on March 1, 2018, with subsequent contributions due November 1 for each\nof the following four years (2019-2022); each contribution is an equal amount\nof $5 million. MassDOT and the MBTA have met their initial obligations under\nthe PPA, notably having met the Start of Construction by having signed a\ncontract and issued a Notice to Proceed to GLX Constructors and by\nestablishing the Green Line Extension Project Cambridge Participation\nExpendable Trust contemplated in the PPA to receive contributions from the\nCity of Cambridge. Based on this, we are fully expecting to need to make the\ninitial $5 million contribution on March 1, 2018.\n\n"

Among\nthose are Sections 18 and 19 which allow cities and towns to increase the\nmaximum base amount upon which the Cost-of Living Adjustment (COLA) is\ncalculated in multiples of $1,000. The current base amount upon which the COLA\nis calculated for retirees is $14,000 or a COLA increase of $420 annually. The\nCity Council adopted the base increase from 12,000 to $14,000 in 2012.\n\nThe Cambridge Retirement Board (CRB) asked its actuary to calculate the\nadditional cost of increasing the COLA base to $16,000. The estimated cost is\napproximately $300,000 annually. For the retiree, this recommended COLA base\nincrease would translate into an increase of $60 to $480 from the current\n$420. It should be noted that the median annual retirement benefit received is\n$24,005. With this recommended change to the base amount, the $60 increase\ntranslates into a quarter percent increase to the median benefit.\n\nThe CRB considered this increase at its November 6, 2017 meeting and voted\nunanimously to approve increasing the base from $14,000 to $16,000. The amount\nneeded to fund this COLA base increase will be included in the FY19 Submitted\nBudget, subject to City Council approval of the increase to $16,000.\n\nIt is my recommendation that the City Council approve this increase.\n\n"

            "aceladescription": "I am pleased to present for your review and approval an Amendment to the\nFoundry Demonstration Project Plan (the \u201cPlan Amendment\u201d). Over the last nine\nmonths, the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority (\u201cCRA\u201d) staff has been working\ntogether with City staff to generate a new approach for the redevelopment of\nthe Foundry after the cancellation of the Development Entity procurement\nprocess occurred in 2016. This new approach responds to interest from the\ncommunity and the City Council in evaluating how a substantially increased\ninvestment by the City and the CRA in the Foundry could facilitate expanded\ncommunity uses in the building. The CRA Board voted to approve the Plan\nAmendment at a public meeting on September 13, 2017.  \n  \nThe Plan Amendment proposes a central role for both the City and the CRA in\nthe Foundry\u2019s physical development and long-term management. The original\nDemonstration Plan called for the Development Entity that was to be retained\nby the CRA to be responsible for both the design and construction of the\nrenovations as well as for the operations and maintenance of the facility once\nthe programs were up and running. The Plan Amendment reflects a substantial\nincrease in City and CRA funding, with the design and construction process to\nbe led by the City, and with the CRA to engage an operator to manage programs,\nproperty management, and leasing. The City and the CRA will cooperate closely\nin both these efforts, as described in the document. Sections that have\nsignificant changes are Section IV.C. Demonstration Project Phases; Section\nV.B. Proposed Governance Model; Section VI. Development Entity Selection\nProcess; and Section VII. Financial Plan.  \n  \nThe City and the CRA have benefited over the last nine months from a wide\nrange of input, including a series of Foundry Advisory Committee meetings,\nmonthly discussions about the Foundry at the CRA Board meetings, City Council\nhearings, public community forums, East Cambridge Planning Team meetings, and\nmany other small group meetings. With this input, continued research into the\nbuilding\u2019s physical potential and programming opportunities, and approval by\nthe CRA Board and the City Council or the Plan Amendment, we are excited to\nembark on this new approach that we anticipate will move the redevelopment of\nthe Foundry into becoming a vibrant and vital resource for the community.\n\n"

            "aceladescription": "Listed below are the recommendations of the Community Preservation Act\nCommittee (CPAC) for FY2018. For additional information, please see\nattachments from the CPA Committee Chair, Lisa Peterson, dated September 19,\n2017.\n\nThe CPA process began with a public meeting held on June 22, 2017, to solicit\nsuggestions on CPA projects for FY2018. Based on that meeting and other\ninputs, the CPAC was provided information on project funding requests. A\npublic hearing was held on July 27, 2017, to solicit recommendations from the\npublic on percentage allocations. The CPAC also received several petitions,\nletters and e-mails along with online project requests from the public\nrelative to CPA recommendations. The CPAC, on September 19, 2017, unanimously\nvoted for an allocation of 80% for Affordable Housing, 10% for Historical\nPreservation Projects and 10% for Open Space Projects.\n\nIn accordance with the CPAC\u2019s recommendations, I am requesting that the City\nCouncil appropriate a total of $12,832,848 in CPA funds raised by the City's\nFY2018 CPA surcharge, the FY2017 state match funds received in FY2018 and a\nportion of the existing CPA fund balance and funds currently in the Open Space\nReserve and Historic Preservation Reserve fund.\n\nFor this appropriation, it is estimated that the net local receipts from the\nCPA surcharge for FY2018 will total $9,000,000, added to an anticipated FY2017\nstate match of approximately $1,470,000 and an additional $2,100,000 from CPA\nFund Balance. Additionally, $18,750 from the Historic Preservation Reserve\nfund, $234,098 from the Open Space Reserve fund balance is being recommended\nfor appropriation, and $10,000 from CPA Fund Balance for the annual membership\nto the Community Preservation Coalition.\n\n# On September 12 and 19, 2017, the CPAC made recommendations for allocation\nof these FY2018 funds.

            "aceladescription": "I am writing with regard to the City\u2019s previous submission of a Home Rule\nPetition to the Legislature whereby I requested authorization to include in\nthe planned reconstruction (the \u201cProject\u201d) of the King Open / Cambridge Street\nUpper School and Community Complex (\u201cKOCSUS\u201d) the area that is presently\noccupied by the public swimming pool known as the Gold Star Pool (the \u201cPool\nSite\u201d) and to construct subsurface geothermal wells in a portion of Donnelly\nField that lies directly along and adjacent to the current southerly boundary\nof the KOCSUS site. Both the area proposed for the construction of the\nsubsurface geothermal wells and the Gold Star Pool are presently owned and\nheld by the City for \u201cpublic park and park\u201d purposes and therefore are\nprotected under Article 97 from any change in use absent legislation\nauthorizing such a change in use.  \n  \nIn order to proceed with the design of the Project as planned, to construct\nthe subsurface geothermal wells within a portion of Donnelly Field and to\nrelocate the Gold Star Pool Site as part of the overall Project, I previously\nrequested that the City Council vote in favor of filing a Home Rule Petition.\nAs I previously informed you in my original submission to the Council with\nregard to the proposed home rule petition, the new location of the Gold Star\nPool, which will be adjacent to Berkshire Street and Donnelly Field, will be\nbeneficial to the City and the community because it allows for a larger pool\nand deck space, a new wading pool, and it faces south with a direct connection\nto Donnelly Field. The new location allows better visibility from Berkshire\nStreet and Donnelly Field. The new pool house and changing rooms will be\nlocated on the first level of the three story building, and the school\nadministrative offices will be located above the pool house and changing\nrooms.  \n  \nOn August 1, 2016, the City Council voted in favor of filing the proposed Home\nRule Petition and the Home Rule Petition was duly filed. The Petition went\nthrough both the House and the Senate. However, the City was recently informed\nby a representative of the state\u2019s Executive Office of Environmental Affairs\n(\u201cEOEA\u201d) that the City\u2019s project description and plans, which appeared to\nreduce the amount of existing open space to a smaller amount of open space,\nwere disfavored by the Legislature. EOEA also pointed out that the square\nfootage of open space that the City referenced in its proposed legislation\n(11,733 sf) included only the relocated swimming pool, and that the relocated\npool house structure, that will have two additional levels of school\nadministration offices above it, is not included in the area to be protected\nas open space. We were informed that EOEA believes that the proposed Home Rule\nPetition would be more likely looked upon favorably by the Legislature if it\nwere to include all of the relocated pool area as part of the open space area,\nincluding the pool house structure, even though the relocated pool house\nstructure would be located at the ground level of a structure that would have\ntwo additional floors of school administration office space above it. By\nincluding all of the relocated pool area and pool house structure as part of\nthe open space area, the new open space area including the pool house\nstructure will be larger than the Pool Area at its existing location, and the\noverall open space area will be increased from the existing 17,892 square feet\nto the new 18,459 square feet.  \n  \nRelief is also required from the Legislature to construct subsurface\ngeothermal wells within a portion of Donnelly Field that lies directly along\nand adjacent to the southern edge of the School Site. All existing \u201cpublic\npark and park\u201d uses that are conducted in that part of Donnelly Field will\ncontinue to be conducted after the installation of the subsurface geothermal\nwells and reconstruction of the existing recreational facilities at that part\nof the site. This part of the original Home Rule Petition remains unchanged.  \n  \nI am therefore requesting that you approve the submission of the attached\namended Home Rule Petition to the Legislature. I have also attached for your\ninformation a plot plan showing (a) the existing swimming pool area, (b) the\nproposed swimming pool area, and (c) the proposed geothermal pool area, and\nsite renderings showing the existing and proposed site conditions and\ncalculations relating to the existing and proposed pool locations at the\nproposed Project Site.\n\n"

For purposes of the Massachusetts Conflict of\nInterest Law, when the City contracts with a particular appraiser, that\nappraiser is considered a regular municipal employee, subject to all the\nConflict of Interest Law\u2019s restrictions on regular municipal employees. If the\nCity Council designates this position to be that of a special municipal\nemployee, certain of the Conflict of Interest Law\u2019s restrictions would apply\nless broadly to such individuals, including G.L.c.268A, s.17 which pertains in\npart to acting as agent for third parties on matters of interest to the City,\nand G.L.c.268A, s.20 which pertains to having more than one contract with the\nsame City. Some contracted property appraisers have requested that the\nposition of contracted property appraiser be designated by the City Council as\na special municipal employee so that the Conflict of Interest Law will not\nexcessively restrict their private professional activities.\n\nPursuant to G.L.c.268A, positions, not individuals, may be designated as\nspecial municipal employees by vote of the City Council if the position is\npart-time allowing work by the individual holding the position at another job\nduring normal working hours; or the position is not paid by the city for more\nthan 800 working hours during a 365 day period. The position at issue meets\nboth of these conditions.\n\nG.L.c.268A, s.17 generally prohibits municipal employees from representing a\nprivate party before municipal boards or departments. It also prohibits\nmunicipal employees from acting as agent for a private party in connection\nwith any matter of direct and substantial interest to their city or town.\nFinally, it prohibits municipal employees from accepting pay or other\ncompensation in connection with any matter of direct and substantial interest\nto their municipality. However, a special municipal employee may: (a)\nrepresent private parties before municipal boards other than his/her own in\ncertain circumstances; (b) act as agent for private parties in connection with\na matter of interest to the City in certain circumstances; and (c) receive pay\nor other compensation in connection with matters involving the City in certain\ncircumstances.  \n  \nG.L.c.268A, s.20 generally prohibits municipal employees from having a direct\nor indirect financial interest in a contract with their city or town. However,\na special municipal employee has the following exemptions to section 20: A\nspecial municipal employee may have a financial interest in a contract with a\ndepartment which is completely independent of the one where he/she works,\nprovided that a disclosure is filed with the City Clerk. A special municipal\nemployee may have a financial interest in a contract with his/her own\ndepartment, with the appropriate disclosure and approvals. A special municipal\nemployee may also hold any number of other special municipal employee\npositions, with the appropriate disclosure and approvals.  \n  \nTherefore, for the above reasons, I request that the City Council vote to\ndesignate the position of contracted part-time property appraiser as that of a\nspecial municipal employee.\n\n"

            "aceladescription": "I am requesting authorization to transfer a leasehold interest in the property\nat 1-15 Vail Court, Cambridge, also known as 139 Bishop Allen Drive, (\u201cthe\nProperty\u201d) to the Cambridge Affordable Housing Trust so that the Trust may\nmove forward with the redevelopment of the Property as affordable housing for\nlow- and moderate-income households. I am also requesting that the City\nCouncil appropriate $750,000 for the demolition of the two structures on the\nProperty.  \n  \nAs you know, in September 2016 the City Council approved the taking of the\nProperty by eminent domain after many years and much frustration in the\ncommunity about blighted condition of buildings there. Since that time the\nCity has taken ownership of the Property, and has secured and inspected the\ntwo structures there. A Board of Survey has determined that the buildings are\nphysically unsound and must be demolished. Building inspections have also\nshown that the buildings contain hazardous materials.  \n  \nThe City has developed a plan for abatement of hazardous materials and\ndemolition of the existing structures. Bids have been obtained for this\nproject and costs are estimated to be $750,000. I am requesting that the City\nCouncil appropriation $750,000 for this effort so that the buildings can be\ndemolished in the coming months.  \n  \nWhile planning for the demolition of the buildings, the City has also\nconsidered how best to advance the redevelopment of the property acknowledging\nthe interest in using the property for affordable housing expressed by the\nCity Council when approving the eminent domain order.  \n  \nThe City, through the City Manager\u2019s Office, held a public meeting on March\n23, 2017 to update the community on the status of the buildings, and to\nsolicit additional input on the future use of the Property. The meeting was\nattended by more than 50 residents, including abutters, other residents, as\nwell as representatives from affordable housing organizations. There was\nstrong support at the meeting for redeveloping the property as affordable\nhousing. There were also several comments from abutters advocating for the\ninclusion of green space, as well as comments that the height, size, and\nlayout of any new buildings should be appropriate for the neighborhood. Many\nmeeting attendees also expressed gratitude to the City for taking steps to\naddress conditions at the Property after many years of frustration.  \n  \nIn keeping with the high priority the City Council has placed on creating\naffordable housing and the input we heard from the community, I am\nrecommending that the City Council approve the authorization to transfer a\nleasehold interest in the property to the Cambridge Affordable Housing Trust\nfor the construction of housing affordable to low- and moderate-income.\nLeasing the land to the Trust for 99 years will allow for the development of\naffordable housing while allowing the City to retain ownership of the\nunderlying land.  \n  \nThe transfer of an interest in real estate to the Trust for the construction\nof low- and moderate-income housing is exempt from the provisions of the\nDisposition Ordinance, Chapter 2.110 of the Cambridge Municipal Code. Chapter\n40, \u00a715A of the General Laws governs the transfer of municipal property from\none municipal use to another. Ordinarily, General Laws Chapter 40, \u00a7 15A\nrequires a two-thirds vote for such a transfer; however, the statute provides\nthat when the transfer is for the purpose of constructing low- and moderate-\nincome housing, a simple majority vote is required.  \n  \nI believe that the Affordable Housing Trust is best suited to initiate the\nredevelopment of the Property as affordable housing in a way that balances\ncommunity housing needs with the desire for an appropriately scaled\ndevelopment and site layout. The Trust will also ensure that the City\u2019s\ninvestment in the Property is leveraged with other public and private funding\nto complete high-quality development that benefits the community.  \n  \nNext Steps  \n  \nThe City has scheduled a community meeting for June 14, 2017 to update the\ncommunity on the plan for hazardous material abatement and demolition.\nAbatement and demolition work is expected to occur in the coming months.  \n  \nCity staff will also begin work with the Trust to schedule public meetings to\nsolicit information on city-wide housing needs and identify possible\naffordable housing uses so that the best affordable housing use of the\nProperty can be determined. City staff and the Trust will also work with the\nCity Manager\u2019s office, the Community Development Department, neighbors, and\nother stakeholders, to develop guidance for the chosen developer around\nbuilding and site design, to ensure a thoughtfully designed development that\nwill benefit future residents of the housing as well as the surrounding\nneighborhood. The Trust will incorporate identified affordable housing\nobjective(s) and guidelines for site design to into a Request for\nQualifications (RFQ) to select a developer capable of carrying out the project\nas envisioned.  \n  \nTo continue progress with advancing efforts to redevelop the property, I\nrecommend the City Council appropriate of $750,000 from Free Cash to the\nPublic Investment Fund Public Works Extraordinary Expenditures Account to\nfacilitate the abatement and demolition of the existing structures on the\nsite, and that the City Council also approve authorization to transfer the a\nleasehold interest in property to the Cambridge Affordable Housing Trust for\nthe construction of low- and moderate-income housing.\n\n"

The site was also a landfill prior to the school\nand ballfield use.

If located on\nthe field this construction would take place while the Tobin School is in use.\nNo decisions have been made on this option, however geotechnical and\nenvironment services are required to evaluate both siting options.

The purpose is to refinance existing General Obligation Bonds\nto acquire lower interest rates than those currently being paid.\n\nSummary:\n\nThe City, in conjunction with its Financial Advisor and Bond Counsel, closely\nmonitors the market for favorable conditions which would potentially allow for\nthe City to reduce its debt service costs. The last time that the City was\nable to take advantage of market conditions was in 2015, when the City\nrefinanced certain eligible bonds allowing it to realize savings of just over\n$2 million in debt service costs. This process of recalling bonds and\nreissuing them to achieve a lower interest rate is common practice. The\nability to take advantage of lower interest costs, if market conditions\npermit, is received favorably by the rating agencies and demonstrates prudent\ndebt management practices and is included in our debt policy, which is\nprojected to result in a savings just under $2 million.\n\nTiming:\n\nThe Refunding is to occur in late May or early June. If, between now and June,\nmarket conditions should deteriorate such that it no longer meets the required\nthresholds, the loan order allows for the City to take no further action, and\nnot proceed with the sale.\n\n"

All city and town leaders have been working assiduously on\nnegotiating a new contract with Motivate.\n\nDue to the complex nature of the contract it is possible that the new contract\nwill not be executed by the expiration date of the existing contract.

Therefore, to avoid any lapse in the bike share system it is\nnecessary to extend the current contract for up to three (3) months beyond the\noriginal term of the contract pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws Chapter\n30(B).\n\nI therefore hereby request that the City Council authorize the Purchasing\nAgent to award an extension to the existing contract with Motivate, for up to\nthree (3) months, in order to allow the system to operate without interruption\nand to enable the City to secure an advantageous contract.\n\n"

The proposed Fund is attached hereto\nfor the City Council\u2019s review and approval, together with the proposed\nProcedures and Guidelines for the Fund.  \n  \nWith the retirement of City Manager Richard Rossi, the Housing Assistance Fund\nin his name was established through the Friends of Richard Rossi, and\ndonations were received for this fund during the fall of 2016.  \n  \nThe purpose of this Fund is to provide limited emergency financial assistance\nto residents experiencing difficulty remaining housed Cambridge. Pending\navailability, the Fund will be used to assist Cambridge residents primarily in\nthe following areas:\n\n\u00b7 First month\u2019s rent (and, where required, last month\u2019s) and security deposit\nfor households needing these funds in order to lease a new unit (e.g. for an\ninclusionary unit) - funds could supplement funds offered through other\nsources including the Multi-Service Center;\n\n\u00b7 Funds for families at risk of foreclosure due to mortgage and/or condo fee\narrearages - there are currently no funds available for this which can be a\nsignificant issue for lower income homeowners as fees and legal costs can\nquickly add significantly when an owner falls behind in payments.\n\n\u00b7 Credit repair - credit can be a big barrier to accessing housing, especially\nfor lower income applicants with poor credit. Access to funds to address (with\nsome limit) credit issues to repair credit could help some applicants who are\nnow denied based on credit; and\n\n\u00b7 Funds for families at risk of homelessness due to rent arrearages - funds\ncould supplement funds offered through other and/or be offered to households\nwho are not eligible for other funds.\n\nI am very pleased to be recommending the creation of this Fund and I\nrespectfully request that the City Council approve the creation of the Fund in\nthe form attached hereto. As City Manager and Deputy City Manager, Richard\nRossi was dedicated to the creation and preservation of affordable housing and\nimproving access to affordable housing in Cambridge. The Richard C. Rossi\nHousing Assistance Fund will, in Mr. Rossi\u2019s name, continue this commitment by\nhelping residents access new housing and assisting in efforts to keep\nresidents with housing risks suitably housed in Cambridge.\n\n"

            "aceladescription": "I am hereby requesting the appropriation of $3,600,000 from the Water Fund\nRetained Earnings account to the Water Fund Other Ordinary Maintenance account\nto fund the purchase of water from the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority\n(MWRA) for approximately three months.\n\nThe Cambridge Water Department (CWD) carefully monitors the City\u2019s water\nsupply system on a weekly basis to ensure an adequate supply of water is\navailable to meet the needs of our residents, businesses, and universities. As\nthe severity of the drought in Massachusetts continues, the usable capacity\nremaining in our reservoir system has been declining due to insufficient\nrainfall. However, Cambridge is not at risk of running out of water because in\naddition to our own water supply, we are a member of the MWRA system, which is\noperating at normal conditions for this time of year.\n\nBased on the current reservoir levels and the need to maintain the operability\nof the water treatment plant, the CWD initiated the use of MWRA water the\nsecond week of October. This approach will allow CWD to maintain enough water\nin our reservoirs to allow the water treatment plant to continue operating at\na minimum of 10 MG per week through the fall of 2017 when the current weather\npredictions indicate that the drought will end.\n\nIn addition to purchasing water, CWD has expanded our conservation efforts\nwith top users and universities and will continue to strongly encourage the\npractice of indoor and outdoor water conservation wherever possible. While\nadditional conservation efforts are an important tool for all users of our\nwater system to participate in, Cambridge\u2019s robust water conservation/water\nefficiency programs over the past two decades have resulted in Cambridge users\nusing significantly less water per user than other communities in the\nCommonwealth and will make this more challenging to find significant water\nusage savings.\n\nAt the plant output of ~10MG per week the cost of MWRA water is estimated to\nbe $1.2M per month.\n\nOur plan, if necessary, is to appropriate funding on a quarterly basis with\nthis being our first appropriation from the water fund balance.\n\nBecause of the significant cost increases that the CWD will incur by\npurchasing water from the MWRA, there will be future financial impacts to the\nCity. The CWD will continuously monitor the drought and precipitation status\nand modify our operational plan to minimize MWRA water usage while maintaining\nplant operations and a \u201chealthy\u201d reservoir system. This will also have an\neffect on the FY18 water rate and impact the FY18 operating and capital\nbudgets.\n\n"

This\nappropriation will fund the replacement of a 105 foot rear aerial ladder ($1.1\nmillion), two paramedic squad units ($400,000) and one ambulance ($200,000).\nThese acquisitions were considered as part of the City\u2019s capital plan, but it\nwas determined that a separate appropriation was the best way to finance this\nequipment. Over the past five years, the City has pulled Fire equipment\npurchases out of the pay-as-you go capital plan due to their extraordinary\ncosts.\n\nThe aerial ladder was purchased in 1994 and has served just under 23 years.\nThe ISO rating system does not give credit for equipment 25 years or older\nregardless of condition.\n\nThe two paramedic squad units will replace the vehicles located at Engine 4\n(Porter Square) and Engine 2 (Lafayette Square). Both units will be replaced\nwith a modular style body utilizing a standard pick-up chassis. This will\nallow for a more cost effective chassis remount replacement in future years\nrather than a complete vehicle purchase. The current vehicles were purchased\nin 2005.\n\nLastly, the 2004 ambulance that is used by the Rescue Company will be taken\nout of service. The new vehicle will support our (OEMS) Office of Emergency\nMedical Services service license requirements as well as numerous special\nevent standby requirements. The unit will have four wheel drive capability for\nresiliency in weather extremes.\n\n"

However, it remains a blight on the neighborhood and a\npublic safety concern. I therefore recommend that the City Council take this\nproperty pursuant to its eminent domain powers and to redevelop the property\nfor the above described uses of providing much needed affordable, senior\nand/or transitional housing. Pursuant to the Council Order and in order to\nsupport this recommendation, I commissioned a real estate appraisal of this\nproperty which was prepared by Steven R. Foster, MAI.

            "aceladescription": "I am pleased to transmit for your review the attached final draft Project\nParticipation Agreement (PPA) between the City of Cambridge, the Massachusetts\nDepartment of Transportation (MassDOT), and the Massachusetts Bay\nTransportation Authority (MBTA), relative to the Green Line Extension (GLX)\nproject. This agreement-which is the result of an extensive negotiation\nprocess between the parties-builds on the framework described in the letter\nthat I transmitted to you at the May 9, 2016 City Council meeting and\ndiscussed at the subsequent meeting of the Transportation and Public Utilities\nCommittee on May 24, 2016. As initially described at that meeting, the City\nhas agreed to make a very significant contribution to the funding of the\nCambridge portions of the GLX, in the amount of $25 million. This\ncontribution, along with additional contributions and funding allocations from\nmunicipalities and the Boston Region Metropolitan Planning Organization, will\nhelp fill the identified funding gap for the GLX, clearing the way for the\nproject to move forward, leading to the construction of a new Lechmere\nStation, and opening up the full development potential of the North Point\narea. Separately, we are negotiating an agreement with DivcoWest (the major\ndevelopers of the North Point area) regarding a contribution of $12.5 million,\nsuch that the overall Cambridge contribution would be split evenly between the\nCity and DivcoWest.\n\nDuring the negotiations regarding the PPA, we have been able to build in a\nnumber of key provisions that protect the City\u2019s interests:\n\n\u00b7 Most critically, the PPA includes a clause that requires MassDOT to return\nthe entire amount of the City\u2019s contribution if the relocated Lechmere Station\nis not open for revenue service within ten years of the start of construction.\nThis guarantee protects the City against any future decisions to modify or\ncancel the project in a manner that doesn\u2019t lead to the relocation of Lechmere\nStation, which is the most critical outcome from our perspective (Section\nc.4.(a) on page 4).\n\n\u00b7 The PPA also includes a clause that suspends the City\u2019s future contributions\nif the project is delayed by more than six months, which both protects our\nfinancial interests and provides additional impetus for MassDOT to continue to\nmove the project forward expeditiously (Section C.4.(b) on page 4).\n\n\u00b7 The contributions under the PPA are structured to avoid the need to\nappropriate funds during periods of time when the City\u2019s free cash balance is\nnot certified by the Commonwealth following the end of the fiscal year\n(Section C.1. on page 3).\n\n\u00b7 The City\u2019s contributions under the PPA will be held in a separate expendable\ntrust, and the City will be entitled to a yearly financial accounting of the\nstatus of this trust (Section B. on page 3).\n\n\u00b7 MassDOT will provide the City with regular updates on project costs and\nschedule (Section B.4. on page 3).\n\n  \nIn transmitting this proposed agreement, I am requesting the City Council\u2019s\napproval to sign this document and commit the City to contributing $25 million\nover the course of five years, with the first payment to be made on March 1,\n2018. The document would then be held in escrow for a short period, until the\nCity has completed negotiations relative to the contribution agreement with\nDivcoWest, and until it is clear that the City of Somerville has also signed a\nsimilar Project Participation Agreement, such that both contributing\nmunicipalities are agreeing to their contributions at the same time. It is\nimportant to note that the PPA includes a provision stating that if in the\nfuture the City chooses not to appropriate the funds necessary to support this\nagreement, MassDOT shall have the authority to demand payment of these funds\nthrough deductions from the Local Aid amount due from the Commonwealth to the\nCity.\n\nAs members of the City Council know, the extension of the Green Line and the\nconstruction of a new Lechmere Station are critical priorities for Cambridge,\nand will help to support economic development and sustainable mobility. I\nbelieve that we have negotiated a groundbreaking agreement that creates a\nframework for municipal support of this critical infrastructure project, while\nprotecting our financial interests and creating greater accountability for\nMassDOT and the MBTA. I hope that you will join with me in supporting this\ncontribution and the attached Project Participation Agreement, and grant me\nthe authority to enter into this agreement to secure the future of the Green\nLine Extension.\n\n"

For additional information, please see\nattachments from the CPA Committee Chair, Lisa Peterson, dated September 19,\n2016.  \n  \nThe CPA process began with a public meeting held on June 15, 2016, to solicit\nsuggestions on CPA projects for FY2017. Based on that meeting and other\ninputs, the CPAC was provided information on project funding requests without\nany recommendations for percentage allocations of anticipated CPA funds. A\npublic hearing was held on July 28, 2016, to solicit recommendations from the\npublic on percentage allocations. The CPAC also received several petitions,\nletters and e-mails along with online project requests from the public\nrelative to CPA recommendations. The CPAC, on September 7, 2016, unanimously\nvoted for an allocation of 80% for Affordable Housing, 10% for Historical\nPreservation Projects and 10% for Open Space Projects.  \n  \nIn accordance with the CPAC\u2019s recommendations, I am requesting that the City\nCouncil appropriate a total of $12,310,000 in CPA funds raised by the City's\nFY2017 CPA surcharge, the FY2016 state match funds received in FY2017 and a\nportion of the existing CPA fund balance.  \n  \nFor this appropriation, it is estimated that the net local receipts from the\nCPA surcharge for FY2017 will total $8,600,000, with an additional state match\nof approximately $1,600,000. In addition, $2,100,000 from CPA Fund Balance is\nbeing recommended for appropriation, plus an additional $10,000 from the Fund\nBalance for annual membership dues to the Community Preservation Coalition.  \n  \nOn September 7, 2016, the CPAC made recommendations for allocation of these\nFY2017 funds.

            "aceladescription": "On August 1, 2016, I submitted to the City Council a request from Port Landing\nLandlord, LLC (\u201cPLL\u201d), for an aerial license for one structural canopy to be\nconstructed over a portion of the public sidewalk. After discussion by the\nCouncil at the August 1, 2016 meeting, PLL\u2019s request was referred back to me\nwith a request to provide the Council further information regarding the\nrequest. In response to the Council\u2019s request for additional information,\nplease find the following supplemental information.\n\n  \nPLL has provided the attached (2) color renderings as well as an architectural\nelevation drawing which show the placement and signage for the proposed canopy\nas well as the street scape. PLL states that two (2) new trees are being\nplanted on Harvard Street along the property\u2019s frontage. In response to the\nCouncil\u2019s inquiry regarding how this canopy fits into the neighborhood, PLL\nstates that the name of the building, \u201cPort Landing\u201d was chosen to reflect its\nconnection to community following the Council\u2019s renaming Area 4 to the \u201cPort.\u201d\nPLL states that this is the only 100% affordable housing development being\nconstructed in the City this year.\n\nAs further background, PLL states that the sign that is proposed for the\ncanopy was reviewed by the City\u2019s Community Development Department (\u201cCDD\u201d)\npursuant to Article 7.000 of Cambridge Zoning Ordinance governing \u201cSigns and\nIllumination.\u201d In addition, PLL represents that this project has been the\nsubject of four (4) neighborhood meetings over the course of four (4) years.\nPLL also states that it sought and obtained a variance from the Cambridge\nBoard of Zoning Appeal for setback and FAR relief for this development.\n\nAs was set forth in the applicant\u2019s August 1, 2016 application, the structural\ncanopy will overhang a portion of the City-owned sidewalk along Harvard Street\nlocated along PLL\u2019s property located at 131 Harvard Street (the \u201cProperty\u201d).\nPLL has agreed that there will be no illuminated signs installed on the canopy\nstructure.\n\nThe dimensions of the canopy structure in front of the Property on Harvard\nStreet will be approximately 41\u2019 feet wide by 2.5\u2019 feet deep. The top of the\ncanopy structure will be approximately 14.5\u2019 feet above the sidewalk. The\ntotal weight of the canopy structure is estimated at 1,800 pounds and is part\nof the second floor structural wood frame that spans the width of the\nbuilding. I have attached a plan and renderings of the proposed canopy\nstructure.\n\nThe total requested license area is one thousand four hundred and eighty five\ncubic feet (1,485 cu. ft.). The requested license area is depicted in the\n\u201cLicense Plan of Land\u201d attached hereto. The Director of Assessing has\ndetermined the annual fee for Fiscal Year 2017 shall be $1,039.00 which shall\nbe subject to annual increases.\n\nIn accordance with the Cambridge Municipal Code, the plans and renderings have\nbeen reviewed by various City departments (Police, Fire, Water, CDD, Public\nWorks (including the City Engineer), Electrical, and Traffic, Parking and\nTransportation). I deemed it appropriate to transmit this license request to\nthe City Council for its consideration pursuant to Section 12.12.200. Section\n12.12.200 allows for the maintenance over the public way of a structural\ncanopy when a permit therefor has been authorized by the City Council. I\nbelieve that the information furnished in this letter is sufficient to enable\nthe City Council to make a determination on this matter.\n\nI recommend that the City Council vote to authorize me to grant a license, in\nsuch form and substance as I deem appropriate, for the installation of a\nstructural canopy at this location.\n\n"

            "aceladescription": "I am writing to request that you approve the submission of the attached Home\nRule Petition that would authorize the City of Cambridge to include in the\nplanned reconstruction (the \u201cProject\u201d) of the King Open / Cambridge Street\nUpper School and Community Complex (\u201cKOCSUS\u201d) the area that is presently\noccupied by the public swimming pool known as the Gold Star Pool (the \u201cGold\nStar Pool Site\u201d) and to construct subsurface geothermal wells in a portion of\nDonnelly Field that lies directly along and adjacent to the current southerly\nboundary of the KOCSUS site (the \u201cSchool Site\u201d).\n\nSpecifically, relief is required from the Legislature to construct a portion\nof the KOCSUS Project on the existing Gold Star Pool Site, which occupies a\nsmall portion of the currently existing School Site that was not included in\nChapter 49 of the Acts of 1955 (the \u201c1955 Legislation\u201d) by which a portion of\nthe original Donnelly Field site (that had comprised the entire block\nstretching easterly from Cambridge Street to Berkshire Street, south along\nBerkshire to York Street, west along York to Willow and then north along\nWillow to Cambridge Street (\u201cOriginal Donnelly Field Site\u201d)) was authorized to\nbe changed from its then \u201cpublic park and park purposes\u201d and re-used \u201cfor the\nerection of a public school building, and for other school purposes, and for\nall purposes incidental thereto\u201d. When the 1955 Legislation was passed, the\nportion of what was to become the School Site remained part of the Original\nDonnelly Field Site to continue to be used for \u201cpublic park and park\u201d purposes\nbecause it was used and occupied by the Gold Star Pool prior to 1955. It\ncontinues to be used and occupied by the Gold Star Pool today.\n\nRelief is also required from the Legislature to construct subsurface\ngeothermal wells within a portion of Donnelly Field that lies directly along\nand adjacent to the southern edge of the School Site. All existing \u201cpublic\npark and park\u201d uses that are conducted in that part of Donnelly Field will\ncontinue to be conducted after the installation of the subsurface geothermal\nwells.\n\nPursuant to Article 97 of the Articles of Amendment to the Constitution of the\nCommonwealth of Massachusetts (\u201cArticle 97\u201d), land that is held and dedicated\nfor parkland uses may only be re-used for another use with the consent of two\nthirds of both houses of the Legislature.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\n1. The Gold Star Pool\n\nThe City\u2019s architect has completed the Schematic Design phase for the KOCSUS\nProject. The design for the KOCSUS Project includes reconstruction of the Gold\nStar Pool and moving the pool south of the existing location. The new location\nof the Gold Star Pool, which will be adjacent to Berkshire Street and Donnelly\nField, will be beneficial to the City and the community because it allows for\na larger pool and deck space, a new wading pool, and it faces south with a\ndirect connection to Donnelly Field. The proposed new location allows better\nvisibility from Berkshire Street and Donnelly Field. The new location is\nsmaller than the existing location (11,773 sf verses 17,890 sf); however, it\nwill provide a more optimized and efficient building layout for the overall\nProject. The new pool house and changing rooms will be located on the first\nlevel of the three story building, and the school administrative offices will\nbe located above the pool house and changing rooms.\n\n2. Geothermal Wells\n\nThe KOCSUS Project is being designed as a Net Zero Emissions (\u201cNZE\u201d) project.\nThe two main systems helping to facilitate that goal are photovoltaic panels\n(\u201cPV\u201d) which produce electricity, and the subsurface geothermal wells that\nprovide tempered water for heating and cooling the building. The PVs are\nprimarily on the roof and the geothermal wells will be below grade. The\nsubsurface geothermal wells will be installed in areas that will not have any\nbuilding structures above them. The new building and site design will\nsignificantly increase the green space around the Project buildings at the\nSchool Site.\n\nThe Project design requires 190 wells. They are spaced 20\u2019 apart, and even\nwith the additional green space on the Project Site, the 190 wells cannot all\nfit within the existing School Site. The area outside of the School Site that\nis proposed for the balance of the subsurface geothermal wells is the strip of\nland along the northern edge of Donnelly Field between Willow and Berkshire\nStreets that is presently used for a seating area, basketball courts, and the\nFrisoli play area. In the final constructed condition, the subsurface\ngeothermal wells and piping will reside underground and remain unseen while\nthe disturbed surface will be restored and replaced with a new park,\nbasketball courts and seating area.\n\nHOME RULE LEGISLATION\n\nBoth the area proposed for the construction of the subsurface geothermal wells\nand the Gold Star Pool are presently located in parts of the Original Donnelly\nField Site, which is owned and held by the City for \u201cpublic park and park\u201d\npurposes and therefore is protected under Article 97 from any change in use\nabsent legislation authorizing such a change in use. In order to proceed with\nthe design of the Project as planned, to construct the subsurface geothermal\nwells within a portion of Donnelly Field and to use the Gold Star Pool Site as\npart of the overall site for the Project, I ask that the City Council vote in\nfavor of filing the attached Home Rule Petition.\n\nI have attached for your information a site plan and plan attachment sheets\ndepicting the restrictions on the existing Original Donnelly Field Site, the\ndescription of the requests and benefits of the proposed changes that are\nrequested, site renderings showing the existing and proposed site conditions,\nand calculations relating to the existing and proposed pool locations at the\nproposed Project Site.\n\n"

At the time of the appropriation, an estimate was used. In order\nto complete the purchase, an additional $42,655 is required.\n\nBACKGROUND: The 2005 Concord-Alewife Plan identified the acquisition of the\nremaining Watertown Branch parcels and creation of a path as a priority for\nthe area in order to create additional off-road connections to Danehy Park,\nFresh Pond Mall and to create the possible future connection to a multiuse\npath along the Fitchburg Line to Porter Square. At that time a zoning overlay\ndistrict was created to encourage the preservation of the rail line as open\nspace and conversion to a greenway and multi-use path.\n\nFUTURE PLAN: This path will be an extension of the existing path along Fresh\nPond Parkway that is also currently being extended into Watertown through a\npartnership between the City of Cambridge and the state Department of\nConservation and Recreation (DCR) known as the Watertown Cambridge Greenway.\nFunds would also be used to complete a conceptual design needed to identify\nopportunities, constraints and an approximate cost to construct the path in\nthe future.\n\nAlewife is a busy area with many transportation needs and opportunities. A\nrobust and expanding off-road, multi-use path network is part of those\nfacilities, and is needed to encourage sustainable trips in the Alewife area\nto reduce existing congestion. Paths through the area make many regional\nconnections into Arlington (Minuteman Bikeway), Belmont (Alewife Greenway\nExtension), and Somerville (Alewife Greenway). The extended Watertown-\nCambridge Greenway will complete the connection between Cambridge and\nWatertown as well as the regional link between the Minuteman Bikeway and the\nCharlies River path system.\n\n"

At that time a zoning overlay\ndistrict was created to encourage the preservation of the rail line as open\nspace and conversion to a greenway and multi-use path.\n\nFUTURE PLAN: This path will be an extension of the existing path along Fresh\nPond Parkway that is also currently being extended into Watertown through a\npartnership between the City of Cambridge and the state Department of\nConservation and Recreation (DCR) known as the Watertown Cambridge Greenway.\nFunds would also be used to complete a conceptual design needed to identify\nopportunities, constraints and an approximate cost to construct the path in\nthe future.\n\nAlewife is a busy area with many transportation needs and opportunities. A\nrobust and expanding off-road, multi-use path network is part of those\nfacilities, and is needed to encourage sustainable trips in the Alewife area\nto reduce existing congestion. Paths through the area make many regional\nconnections into Arlington (Minuteman Bikeway), Belmont (Alewife Greenway\nExtension), and Somerville (Alewife Greenway). The extended Watertown-\nCambridge Greenway will complete the connection between Cambridge and\nWatertown as well as the regional link between the Minuteman Bikeway and the\nCharlies River path system.\n\n"

(the\n\u201cChamber\u201d) with regard to the City\u2019s eminent domain taking of the Chamber\u2019s\nproperty on June 13, 2016. The property is a parcel of land comprising\napproximately 5,000 square feet of land located at 859 Massachusetts Avenue,\nCambridge (the \u201cProperty\u201d). On June 13, 2016, the Council approved an Order to\ntake the Property by eminent domain and an Order appropriating the estimated\npro tanto payment to be paid to the Chamber for the Property in the amount of\nOne Million, Three Hundred Sixty-Three Thousand, Eight Hundred Seventy-Five\n($1,363,875) Dollars, as damages deemed sufficient by the Chief Assessor to\ncover the estimated pro tanto payment (the average three prior years\u2019 assessed\nvalue plus twenty-five 25% percent (the Factor Maximum Value)) toward the\nexpenses of acquisition as required by the previously referenced Sections of\nChapters 40 and 43 of the General Laws. This is the maximum that the City can\npay as a pro tanto payment for a property that is being taken by eminent\ndomain.  \n  \nAs I informed the Council, under the law, the property owner has the right to\nchallenge the amount of the pro tanto payment in a legal proceeding and could\nseek to persuade a court that it is entitled to the actual fair market value\nof the property as well as certain other statutory damages such as relocation\ncosts. I informed you on June 13 that I would initiate a settlement of any\nsuch claim with the property owner once the City Council voted to authorize\nthe taking of this Property by eminent domain.  \n  \nThe Council authorized me in Executive Session to negotiate a value to be paid\nin settlement of the Chamber\u2019s damages claim in the event that the Property\nwas taken by eminent domain. As previously discussed with the Council in\nExecutive Session, I have obtained a confidential appraisal of the Property\nwhich was performed by Mr. Steven Foster. Mr. Foster has determined in his\nappraisal that the fair market value of the Property is Two Million, Six\nHundred Thousand ($2,600,000) Dollars.  \n  \nI am pleased to report that after obtaining and reviewing the appraisal from\nMr. Foster I have successfully reached a settlement with the Chamber to\nresolve the damages claim, which will result in the total amount to be paid to\nthe Chamber for the Property of Two Million, Six Hundred Thousand ($2,600,000)\nDollars. In exchange for the additional payment of One Million, Two Hundred\nThirty-Six Thousand, One Hundred Twenty-Five ($1,236,125) Dollars, the City\nwill receive an executed general release from the Chamber which will release\nthe City from any and all further liability to the Chamber arising out of this\neminent domain taking of the Property. I am therefore returning to the Council\nnow to request a further appropriation in the amount of One Million, Two\nHundred Thirty-Six Thousand, One Hundred Twenty-Five ($1,236,125) Dollars,\nwhich would constitute a final agreed total damages award to the Chamber in\nthe amount of Two Million, Six Hundred Thousand ($2,600,000) Dollars for the\ntaking of this Property; and I am further requesting that the Council\nauthorize me to settle the damages claim in that amount.\n\n  \n  \nI look forward to discussing this matter with you and answering any questions\nthat you may have.\n\n"

            "aceladescription": "I am pleased to report that the City of Cambridge is continuing to make\nprogress on the application for funding under the Commonwealth\u2019s\nInfrastructure Investment Incentive Program (I-Cubed) for the North Point area\nof the City.  \n  \nIn order to move towards final approval from the Commonwealth, I am requesting\nCity Council approval of three orders related to the I-Cubed program which are\nsummarized below, and detailed in the Order attached:  \n\n1\\. Approval of the North Point Economic Development Proposal and the\nprovision of Local Infrastructure Development Assistance;\n\n2\\. Approval for the creation, by the City, of a Municipal Liquidity Reserve\nfor each Assessment Parcel to be funded by moneys or a letter of credit to be\nprovided by the owner of each Assessment Parcel;\n\n3\\. Approval of the acquisition or acceptance by the City of such property\ninterests in the North Point Public Infrastructure Improvements that are\nfinanced by MassDevelopment as may be required under the I-Cubed Program,\nsubject to provisions of the Infrastructure MOA.\n\n  \nSince 2013, the City has been involved in this collaborative process, which\nleverages the strong development climate in the city, and will fund vital\ninfrastructure improvements for the area as well as provide long term benefits\nto the City.  \n  \nThe I-Cubed program provides a mechanism for funding public infrastructure\nassociated with economic development projects. It relies on new state tax\nrevenues derived primarily from new jobs associated with the project to pay\ndebt service on the bonds, which are issued by the Commonwealth to fund the\ninfrastructure. The State issues the bonds only after establishing that new\nstate tax revenues will support the debt service. The application requests $25\nmillion in State funding (half of the maximum amount allowed for any\ndevelopment project under the program) to be used to support a portion of the\napproximately $78 million in aggregate investment by the applicants in public\ninfrastructure improvements in and around North Point.  \n  \nAs part of this process, City is required to hold a public hearing regarding\nthe North Point I-Cubed proposal. A public hearing took place on Tuesday, June\n14, 2016 at 7:00 pm at the Citywide Senior Center.  \n  \nBelow is a summary of what was presented at the hearing:  \n  \nRichard Rossi, City Manager for the City of Cambridge, opened the hearing by\nproviding an overview of the I-Cubed process. He noted that the City has been\nclosely examining this program since 2013 in terms of value and associated\nrisks. The North Point I-Cubed proposal is a joint effort by and among EF\nEducation First, the North Point Development Team, the City of Cambridge, and\nthe Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  \n  \nSeveral City departments have been actively involved in this process\nincluding: the City Manager\u2019s Office, City Solicitor, Finance Department, City\nAssessor, Community Development Department, Purchasing Agent, the Traffic,\nParking and Transportation Department and the Department of Public Works. In\nJanuary 2014, the City retained First Southwest, a financial consultant, and\nLocke Lord LLP, outside counsel, to work with City officials to analyze the\nbenefits and potential risk to the City. The City also retained Anderson &\nKreiger as outside counsel to assist in drafting and negotiating agreements\nwith the North Point developer regarding the infrastructure improvements to be\nmade as part of the I-Cubed process.  \n  \nRepresentatives from EF Education First and the North Point Development Team\npresented on the importance and benefits of the program to their plans for\ngrowth in the area. They also provided a summary of the changes and\nsignificant private investment that has occurred in North Point in recent\nyears. It was explained that all parties involved up to this point have strong\nconfidence in the revenue projections associated with the new developments and\nfinancial assumptions used in analyzing the program.  \n  \nSusanne Rasmussen, Director of Environment and Transportation Planning in the\nCommunity Development Department, talked about some of the important community\nbenefits that will be gained through the infrastructure improvements: A new\ninternal roadway network that emphasizes walking and biking and accommodates\ntransit use, shortened distance to the Community College MBTA station through\na new pedestrian link; ability to accommodate a new Lechmere MBTA Station,\nfacilitating the conversion of automobile trips to transit trips for both\ncommuting and all other trip purposes to North Point, the Kendall Square area,\ndowntown Boston, and other locations along the Green Line; enhanced bicycle\nand pedestrian connections to the river as well as the wider regional pathway\nnetwork; reconstruction of Monsignor O\u2019Brien Highway which will provide new,\nsafer, pedestrian crossings connecting East Cambridge, Kendall Square and\nNorth Point, and allow for improved bike mobility through new grade-separated\ncycle tracks along the road; and the extension of First Street to Monsignor\nO\u2019Brien Highway which will facilitate shifting the burden of automobile\ntraffic between Kendall Square and points north from Third Street onto First\nStreet, which is more commercial in character.  \n  \nLouis DePasquale, Assistant City Manager for Fiscal Affairs in the City of\nCambridge, reviewed financial implications and benefits of the project. He\nnoted that the I-Cubed regulations are set up in a way that allow appropriate\noversight and protections for the City and reminded the group that neither\nCity property taxes, nor City bonds, are used to finance the program. He\nrestated confidence in the projections used, and noted that when the\ncumulative revenues exceed the outstanding principal and accrued interest on\nthe Bonds, the City\u2019s contingent obligation ends. He shared that this is\ncurrently projected to happen as early as 2023. Robert Reardon, City Assessor\nfor the City of Cambridge, added that an Assessment Plan is required by I\n-Cubed regulations and that the City is allowed to assess certain North Point\nproperties in the unlikely event of any shortfall in sales and income tax\nrevenue, which provides additional protections for the City.  \n  \nThere were no comments from the public at this hearing, but it should be noted\nthat presentations have been made to the East Cambridge Planning Team, and we\nlook forward to final approval by the City Council.  \n  \nI strongly believe that this is an exceptional opportunity for the City. As\nproposed, there is minimal financial risk or cost to the City, and the funding\nwill allow for key infrastructure improvements that are not only important in\nrealizing the comprehensive vision for this area, but also result in\nsignificant long term benefits for the entire City.\n\n  \n  \nAttachments to this letter are as follows:  \n\n1\\. Letter to the City Manager from the North Point Development Team, dated\nJune 15, 2016\n\n2\\. North Point I-Cubed Proposal: Frequently Asked Questions\n\n3\\. North Point Infrastructure Investment Incentive Program Public Hearing\nPresentation, June 14, 2016\n\n4\\. City Manager letter to the City Council, dated July 28, 2014\n\n5\\. City Manager Order\n\nThank you again and I am happy to answer any questions and discuss next steps\nin this process.  \n\n"

Pursuant to Section 30\nof Chapter 43, Section 14 of Chapter 40, and Chapter 79 of the General Laws,\nall as amended, it is provided that the Cambridge City Council may take in fee\nin the name of the City for any municipal purpose any land within the limits\nof the City not already appropriated for public use. I recommend that the City\nCouncil take the above referenced parcel of land for municipal purposes,\nincluding but not limited to the creation of affordable housing and municipal\noffice purposes, and for all uses and purposed accessory thereto.  \n  \nI also recommend that the City Council approve an Order appropriating One\nMillion Three Hundred Sixty-Three Thousand Eight Hundred Seventy-Five\n($1,363,875) Dollars to the General Fund Law Department Travel & Training\n(Judgment & Damages) Account from Free Cash, as damages deemed sufficient by\nthe Chief Assessor to cover the estimated pro tanto payment toward the\nexpenses of acquisition as required by the above referenced Sections of\nChapters 40 and 43 of the General Laws.  \n  \nUnder the law, the property owner has the right to challenge the amount of the\npro tanto payment in a legal proceeding and could seek to persuade a court\nthat it is entitled to the actual fair market value of the property as well as\ncertain other statutory damages such as relocation costs. I will initiate a\nsettlement of any such claim with the property owner if the City Council votes\nto approve these two orders and authorizes the taking of this property by\neminent domain. In the event that I successfully reach a proposed settlement\nwith the property owner to resolve such damages claim, I anticipate returning\nto the City Council in the near future with a request for a further\nappropriation which would authorize me to settle the claim and would\nconstitute a final agreed damages award to the Chamber of Commerce to pay for\nthe taking of this property.  \n  \nI look forward to discussing this matter with you and answering any questions\nthat you may have.\n\n"

This update was prepared with staff\nand community input and has been reviewed and approved by the Massachusetts\nEmergency Management Agency (MEMA) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency\n(FEMA). The plan was funded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s\n(FEMA) Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) Grant Program.\n\nPlanning for the Cambridge Hazard Mitigation Plan 2015 Update was led by the\nCambridge Local Hazard Mitigation Planning Committee. This committee discussed\nwhere the impacts of natural hazards most affect the City, goals for\naddressing these impacts, and hazard mitigation measures that would benefit\nthe City.\n\nThe Federal Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 requires all municipalities that\nwish to be eligible to receive FEMA funding for hazard mitigation grants, to\nadopt a local multi-hazard mitigation plan and update this plan in five year\nintervals.\n\nNatural hazard mitigation planning is the process of determining how to\nsystematically reduce or eliminate the loss of life and property damage\nresulting from natural hazards such as floods, earthquakes, and hurricanes\nthrough long-term strategies. These long-term strategies include planning,\npolicy changes, programs, projects, and other activities.\n\nFlooding, driven by hurricanes, northeasters, and other storms, clearly\npresents the greatest hazard to the City of Cambridge, most especially in\nlocations that are low-lying or where drainage and conveyance systems can be\noverwhelmed during storm events with significant precipitation.\n\nAttached is the Executive Summary of the 2015 Hazard Mitigation Plan.

            "aceladescription": "For many years, the City of Cambridge has been committed to improving safety\nfor all users of the transportation system, particularly those users who are\nmost vulnerable. As part of this commitment, we have undertaken a wide range\nof engineering, education, and enforcement efforts aimed at reducing crashes,\nincreasing respect amongst users, and generally creating a safer and more\nequitable transportation network that meets the needs of users of all ages and\nall abilities. As a result of these efforts, we have seen an ongoing decrease\nin crash rates, as well as a reduction in the number of fatalities and serious\ninjuries. Nonetheless, even one fatality or serious injury is more than we\nwant to see, and we are continually seeking out ways to further reduce these\ntypes of incidents, and the pain and suffering they cause to individuals and\nour community at large.  \n  \nIn recent years, a number of communities-first in Europe and now increasingly\nin the United States-have begun to commit to Vision Zero, which sets a goal of\neliminating transportation fatalities and serious injuries. Vision Zero is\nboth an aspirational goal and a real goal, and we believe that in a community\nlike Cambridge, it is in fact feasible to attempt to eliminate these types of\nserious incidents, through the types of engineering, education, and\nenforcement efforts we are already undertaking, with a particular focus on the\nsafety of our system. Vision Zero provides a very helpful perspective on how\nwe improve transportation safety and the actions that we need to take to make\nthe goal a reality.  \n  \nThrough the national Vision Zero Network (www.visionzeronetwork.org\n<http://www.visionzeronetwork.org>), many communities have already committed\nto Vision Zero and have developed action plans that detail how they plan to\nachieve the elimination of transportation fatalities and serious injuries (see\nthe attached map for communities that have committed to Vision Zero or are\nconsidering doing so). The goals and approach associated with Vision Zero are\nbroadly consistent with our existing approach to transportation planning,\ndesign, and operations, including the following policies, plans, and programs:  \n\n\u00b7 The Vehicle Trip Reduction Ordinance\n\n\u00b7 The Climate Protection Plan\n\n\u00b7 The Pedestrian Plan\n\n\u00b7 The Bicycle Plan\n\n\u00b7 The Transit Strategic Plan\n\n\u00b7 The Five-Year Street and Sidewalk Reconstruction Plan\n\n\u00b7 The Community Health Improvement Plan\n\n\u00b7 The Safe Routes to School Program\n\n\u00b7 The CitySmart Program\n\nBased on the policies and plans, we do not expect that committing to Vision\nZero will require significant new expenditures. Rather, it will create an\nenhanced focus on safety as we look at transportation problems and solutions\nthrough the lens of public health and harm reduction. In recent years, we have\ndone extensive analysis of crash statistics in Cambridge, which has given much\nimproved data about safety issues and locations where improvements are needed.\nThis data will form the basis of our Vision Zero efforts, allowing us to take\na data-driven approach to achieving the Vision Zero goal.\n\nAs City Manager, I am prepared to commit to Vision Zero, as are all of the key\nCity Departments involved in transportation, including Community Development,\nPolice, Public Health, Public Works, and Traffic, Parking, and Transportation.\nI ask that the City Council will join us in this commitment by approving the\nattached resolution and demonstrating that the City of Cambridge is fully\ncommitted to eliminating transportation fatalities and serious injuries.\n\nMap of Vision Zero Communities\n\n![](/Citizens/GetImage.aspx?Type=25&ID=/Aspose.Words.883c68d2-7536-49c6-abe9-84edc76f237a.001.png)\n\n"

            "acelatitle": " A communication transmitted from Richard C. Rossi, City Manager, relative to the block rates for water consumption and sewer use for the period beginning April 1, 2016 and ending March 31, 2017.",
            "aceladescription": "RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nThe City administration and City Council continue to recognize the importance\nof minimizing increases in water and sewer rates. I recommend that the City\nCouncil approve a 0% increase in the water consumption block rate and a 3.2%\nincrease in the sewer use block rate, resulting in a 2.4% increase in the\ncombined rate for the period beginning April 1, 2016 and ending March 31,\n2017. This is the sixth consecutive year that the City has been able to\nproduce a 0% increase in the water rate.  \n  \nIn last year\u2019s recommendation, the projected FY17 rate increases for water,\nsewer, and combined were 3.1%, 7.7%, and 6.4%, respectively, based on March\n2015 consumption rates and projected budgets. We have been able to produce\nrates lower than estimated due primarily to lower operating budget projections\nin the Water Budget, and lower projected Massachusetts Water Resources\nAuthority (MWRA) assessments in the Sewer Budget. The MWRA provides annual\nupdates to their projected assessments.  \n  \nIn March of each year, the City Council establishes water and sewer rates,\nwhich determine water and sewer revenues for the next fiscal year. Because of\nthe timing requirements, water and sewer rates are set prior to the adoption\nof both the Cambridge budget and MWRA budget; therefore, revenue needs are\nbased upon estimated expenditures. Historically, water and sewer rates have\nbeen established so that revenues generated by them, when combined with other\nrelated revenue sources, cover projected annual costs.\n\nWATER\n\nTwo major factors determine the rate necessary to generate sufficient\nrevenues: water consumption and the budget. The total FY17 Water Budget\nreflects a $108,815 increase from FY16. Water is able to offset costs related\nto cost-of-living allowances, pensions, and health benefits in the salaries\nand wages portion of the operating budget with a decrease in debt service\npayments.\n\nThe planned FY17 capital allocation is $5,000,000 using pay-as-you-go capital\nfunding based on current revenues ($3,500,000) and fund balance ($1,500,000).\nThe major project in the FY17 budget is the second phase of the installation\nof variable frequency drives (VFDs) to the raw water pump system. An\nadditional $1,000,000 million has been included for the replacement of\nexisting VFDs on the finished water pumps. Installation of the VFDs will\nsubstantially improve energy efficiency at the water treatment plant. The\ntotal project cost is $5,000,000 over two years, of which $3,000,000 was\nfunded from fund balance. The remainder of the FY17 capital allocation will be\nused for improvements to the distribution and transmission system, treatment\nplant equipment replacement, consulting services, and improvements to the\nwatershed. Table 4 on page 5 indicates the details of water fund projected\nrevenues and expenditures for FY16-21. Table 7 on page 8 shows actual water\nfund balances for FY11-15 and the projected balance for FY16.  \n  \nTo support a 0% water rate increase for the sixth year, $350,000 from fund\nbalance will be used in FY17, bringing the total fund balance used to\n$1,850,000. We expect to eliminate the use of the fund balance in FY18, as\ndecreases in debt service continue and as long as water consumption remains\nconstant.  \n  \n\nWater and sewer charges are directly linked to water consumption, with sewer\ncosts comprising approximately 71.2% of total water and sewer expenditures.\nWhen consumption declines, revenues are negatively impacted. In the current\nfiscal year, water is being consumed at a rate similar to the previous fiscal\nyear. If this trend continues, this would be the second year in which\nconsumption has not decreased.\n\n####\n\n#### SEWER\n\nThe FY17 sewer budget reflects a 6.0% increase from FY16. This includes the\nMWRA assessment, debt service payments, and the sewer component of the Public\nWorks budget. Debt service on sewer bonds and the MWRA assessment account for\n90.2% of the total Sewer Budget.  \n  \nFY17 estimated sewer revenues will cover the FY17 estimated MWRA assessment,\nwhich is scheduled to increase by $639,184 from the FY16 final assessment. The\nMWRA rate increase projected for the City is subject to change based on the\nMWRA budget, which is adopted later in spring 2016. These changes have\ntypically been minor in past years. Unlike the water budget, sewer revenues\nare credited to the general fund and not to a separate proprietary fund that\ncan be drawn upon if the need arises.  \n  \nIncluded in the sewer budget are debt service increases attributable to the\n$12,740,000 general obligation bonds issued in February 2016 and the February\n2016 SRF loan for Concord Avenue for $14,000,000.  \n  \nThe following sewer projects were included in the February 2016 bond issue:\nCherry Street / South Massachusetts Avenue; Alewife Watershed; and Harvard\nSquare projects.  \n  \nThe FY17 capital allotment of $1,000,000 in sewer revenues will continue to\nfinance the remedial reconstruction program and development.  \n  \nThe City Council has authorized significant investments in the water and sewer\nsystems to ensure Cambridge continues to benefit from a healthy and\nenvironmentally sound water and sewer system. In addition to the projects\ncurrently under way, the City\u2019s five-year capital plan (FY17-21) calls for an\nadditional investment of approximately $135,663,000 (primarily sewer,\n$114,663,000) in the water and sewer systems. The City carefully monitors the\nissuance of debt to fund authorized sewer projects and makes adjustments to\nensure that debt service cost increases, which impact the sewer rate, are\nmoderate.  \n  \nSubsidies from the SRF loan program will cover only $44,240 or 0.2% of the\ntotal debt service of $19,942,737 for all FY17 sewer projects. The City will\ncontinue to receive state subsidies on existing debt. The FY18-21 capital plan\nincludes other projects that may be eligible for subsidized loans from the\nstate. As in past years, it is not certain that these projects will receive\nstate subsidies and the debt service on these projects has been calculated\nbased on funding through general obligation bonds. If state subsidies become\navailable to the City, they will be used to lower the sewer rate in future\nyears. Table 5 on page 6 shows the detail of sewer-related expenditures and\nrevenues for FY16-21.\n\nCOMBINED WATER & SEWER\n\nThe table below reflects the projected combined water and sewer metered\nrevenue requirements needed to cover water and sewer expenditures.\n\nTABLE 1\n\n|\n\nFY16 Projected\n\n|\n\nFY17 Budget\n\n|\n\n% Change  \n  \n---|---|---|---  \n  \nWater\n\n|\n\n$17,135,000\n\n|\n\n$17,137,015\n\n|\n\n0.0%  \n  \nSewer\n\n|\n\n$46,350,000\n\n|\n\n$47,844,595\n\n|\n\n3.2%  \n  \nCombined Water / Sewer Revenue\n\n|\n\n$63,485,000\n\n|\n\n$64,981,610\n\n|\n\n2.4%  \n  \nFY17 projected revenues are based on FY16 projected collections and reflect\nour practice of conservative revenue projections.\n\nThe table below reflects the FY16 actual and FY17 proposed water and sewer\nrates.\n\nTABLE 2\n\n|\n\n|\n\n##\n\n## Annual Consumption*\n\n|\n\nFY16\n\nWater\n\nRate\n\n|\n\nFY17\n\nProposed Water Rate\n\n|\n\nFY16\n\nSewer\n\nRate\n\n|\n\nFY17\n\nProposed Sewer Rate  \n  \n---|---|---|---|---|---|---  \n  \n## Block 1\n\n|\n\n0 \u2013 40 CcF\n\n|\n\n$3.02\n\n|\n\n$3.02\n\n|\n\n$9.21\n\n|\n\n$9.50  \n  \nBlock 2\n\n|\n\n41 \u2013 400 CcF\n\n|\n\n$3.24\n\n|\n\n$3.24\n\n|\n\n$9.74\n\n|\n\n$10.05  \n  \nBlock 3\n\n|\n\n401 \u2013 2,000 CcF\n\n|\n\n$3.44\n\n|\n\n$3.44\n\n|\n\n$10.46\n\n|\n\n$10.79  \n  \nBlock 4\n\n|\n\n2,001 \u2013 10,000 CcF\n\n|\n\n$3.65\n\n|\n\n$3.65\n\n|\n\n$11.26\n\n|\n\n$11.62  \n  \nBlock 5\n\n|\n\nOver 10,000 CcF\n\n|\n\n$3.96\n\n|\n\n$3.96\n\n|\n\n$11.97\n\n|\n\n$12.35  \n  \n*All rates are per CcF.

To qualify for the 30% discount, a\nhomeowner must be 65 or older and must have been granted the Clause 41C\nelderly real estate exemption. For FY16, the income guidelines are as follows:\nsingle, income of $25,197 with assets of $50,392 or less; married, income of\n$37,796 with assets of $69,289 or less.\n\n# FUTURE OUTLOOK FOR RATES\n\nOverall, the City has been extremely successful over the past five years in\nproducing minimal water and sewer rate increases. The average annual increases\nfor the FY12-16 period were as follows: water, 0.0%; sewer, 3.2%; and\ncombined, 2.3%, which include both the water and sewer rates showing 0%\nincreases in FY12 and FY13. The FY14, FY15 and FY16 water rate increase was\nalso 0%.\n\nTables 4, 5, 6 and 7 contain five-year forecasts for water, sewer, and\ncombined revenue estimates as well as water fund balances for the past five\nyears and the projected FY16 fund balance. Although the City currently does\nnot project the use of fund balance in the out years, it will continue to\nreview appropriate use of fund balance for a specific project, or to lower the\nrate. As can be seen in Table 6, the annual combined water / sewer rate is\nprojected to increase by an average of approximately 5.2% for FY17-21. The\nprojected increase is the result of the City\u2019s commitment to bonding sewer\ninfrastructure improvement projects and increases in the MWRA assessment\n(based on estimates received from the MWRA). MWRA increases are projected to\nbe 1.4% - 7.1% in FY17-FY21. If increases in the MWRA assessment are more\nmoderate, the rate increases that are shown will be lowered. If consumption\nincreases and therefore revenues increase, rate increases will be affected\npositively. Conversely, if consumption decreases, there will be a negative\neffect on water and sewer revenues.\n\nOur water and sewer program is structured to produce reasonable rate increases\nin the future. The goal of the City Administration and City Council is to\nminimize the effects of water and sewer rate increases on residents as much as\npossible, while continuing to invest in our infrastructure.\n\n"

Each year since 1999,\nthe City has received these ratings from Moody\u2019s Investors Service, Standard &\nPoor\u2019s and Fitch Ratings. This achievement allows the City to invest more\nmoney into important projects throughout Cambridge with a favorable interest\nrate. The agencies highlighted the City\u2019s conservative budgeting practices and\nprudent use of reserves to help keep tax levy increases at a moderate level to\ncover operating expenditures.  \n  \nThese ratings are in conjunction with the City\u2019s sale of $35 million in\nGeneral Obligation bonds, which took place on March 1, 2016. This sale will\nfinance capital projects such as the King Open/Cambridge Street Upper School\nand Community Complex, sewer reconstruction, street and sidewalk\nreconstruction, and other municipal and school building renovations.  \n  \nAll three agencies have given the City a positive outlook. However, in\nreviewing Moody\u2019s criteria, it is important that we continue to pay attention\nto the factors listed below to ensure our AAA rating in the future.  \n\n\u00b7 Material growth in the debt burden\n\n\u00b7 Deterioration of the tax base or weakening of the local economy\n\n\u00b7 Trend of operating deficits that lead to a significant reduction in reserve\nlevels\n\n\u00b7 Significant increases in pension and other postemployment benefit (OPEB)\nliabilities\n\n  \nBased on this ongoing recognition from the rating agencies, the City Council\ncan be justly proud of its sound fiscal policies. Additionally, I would like\nto thank the City\u2019s Department Heads and staff for their commitment to\nprudently managing their budgets and programs. The City is fortunate to have\nsuch a strong and dedicated team.\n\n  \nAttached are the rating opinions of Fitch Ratings, Moody\u2019s Investors Service,\nand Standard & Poor\u2019s Corporation.\n\n"

Denise Simmons\n\nThe Finance Committee, comprised of the entire membership of the City Council,\nconducted a public hearing on March 3, 2016 at 5:06 PM in the Ackermann Room.\n\nThe purpose of the hearing was to discuss the FY 16 budget and the FY 17\nbudget process. Vice Mayor McGovern announced that the meeting is being\nprivately audio recorded.\n\nPresent at the hearing were Vice Mayor McGovern, Chair of the Committee,\n\nCouncillor Carlone, Councillor Cheung, Councillor Kelley, Councillor Maher,\nCouncillor Mazen, Councillor Toomey, Mayor Simmons, City Manager Richard\nRossi, Deputy City Manager Lisa Peterson, Assistant City Manager for Fiscal\nAffairs Louis DePasquale, Ellen Semonoff, Assistant City Manager for Human\nService Programs, Iram Farooq, Assistant City Manager for Community\nDevelopment, Budget Director Jeana Franconi, Nancy Glowa, City Solicitor,\nRobert Haas, Commissioner of Police, Ellen Semonoff, Owen O'Riordan, Public\nWords Commissioner, Lee Gianetti, Director of Communications and Community\nRelations and City Clerk Donna P. Lopez.\n\nAlso present were John Hawkinson, 84 Massachusetts Avenue and Hasson Rashid,\n820 Massachusetts Avenue.\n\nVice Mayor McGovern opened the hearing and explained the purpose. The meeting\nwas the result of Policy Order # 9 dated January 25, 2016 (ATTACHMENT A) to\ndiscuss goals as they relate to the current budget and the FY17 budget.\n\nCity Manager Rossi spoke about the FY16 budget as it rolls into FY17 budget.\nHe stated that the preparation of the budget is a top priority for a city\nmanager as it affects the entire City. He explained that 80% of the budget\ncosts are fixed costs which is where the budget starts from. It is no secret\nthat Cambridge has high property values. All the departmental initiatives grow\nthe budget in a positive way. Policy related issues are taken into\nconsideration as well as the state budget. The budget process takes twelve\nmonths. Mr. Rossi stated that in Cambridge the budget is incredible. The\npolice, fire and human services provided in the City has come about as joint\neffort with the city manager, city departments and the community.\n\nCouncillor Cheung noted that City Council committees have goal setting\nmeetings. What is the goal of this meeting? Councillor Carlone stated that\nbecause goals were not set last term the budget is not affected. Councillor\nCheung stated that he had meetings to develop goals for his committees and\nthey roll up into the Government Operations, Rules and Claims Committee.\n\nMr. Rossi explained the process. He stated that the City Manager is\nresponsible for preparing the budget and is impacted in many ways. A goal\nsetting exercised is needed between the City Council and the City Manager. He\nstated that goals need to be broad but tell the story of where the City wants\nto go.\n\nVice Mayor McGovern gave an example. He is interested in having a shower bus\nfor the homeless and would love for Cambridge to have this. Where does he go\nfor this to be in the budget? Mr. Rossi explained that this is the type of\nthing that the City Manager and his team determine how this will be done. He\ncannot prepare a budget on the requests of nine different people; he cannot\nfund everyone's great ideas. Councillor Cheung explained his request for more\nmoney and governance for the IT budget; which took multiple years and this\ntranslated into budgetary money. Mr. Rossi stated that this needed a bigger\nprocess and this budget was increased over a long term process.\n\nCouncillor Mazen stated that the whole finance-City Manager team does a great\njob to provide a budget package. He spoke about balance between specificity\nand implementation. Mr. Rossi stated that from a policy point of view\ninitiatives will come out in the committee process rather than by a policy\norder. The IT process was a more public facing process. Councillor Mazen noted\nthat two major factors of the budget process that will indicate success. They\nare the latitude to cut spending based on discussions with the City Council to\nmake some fiscal decision moving forward and the other is that the City\nCouncil would come together to establish projects which may not be a priority\nand to take a consensus list to give guidance to the City Manager. Mr. Rossi\nstated that in the end that he has to make a decision. He added that the\npersonnel who run the city departments are the experts and he makes his budget\nbased on this input and on the input of the City Council. Councillor Mazen\nstated that if this is done as package the City Manager can tell what can be\ndone on this list. Mr. Rossi stated that this budget meets the needs of the\ncommunity.\n\nVice Mayor McGovern commented that when Plan E is questioned the system works\nbecause of the checks and balances in place. He asked how can the City Council\nhave an impact and have input into the budget process. Mr. Rossi responded\nthat the majority of the increase in the city budget comes from the City\nCouncil. He stated that the needs of the community are great.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that he felt frustrated by the budget process. The\nCity Council had little input. There is a 5-10 year plan and fixed costs due\nto salaries. He stated that more money needs to be put into affordable housing\nand that the childcare strategy makes sense. The City Council general goals is\nwhat the budget is based on and they are not very objective. Mr. Rossi noted\nthat this is within the City Council's purview. This makes it easier for the\nCity Manager to interpret. He explained that the City Manager has to have a\nbalanced budget, fill the needs and protect the City. The City Council's\nresponsibility is to adopt and approve the budget. The City Council can reject\nthe budget or add to the budget. Councillor Carlone asked if the City Council\nis really involved in the budget process. He wanted a list of infrastructure\nproject or housing projects so that he can digest this information. Mr. Rossi\nstated that the City Council is underestimating what impact the City Council\nhas in the budgetary process.\n\nCouncillor Cheung stated that this debate is around the micro versus the macro\nissues. The City Council has to ensure that the City Manager is hiring\ncompetent employees. All the micro issues will wipe out the macro issues. Mr.\nRossi spoke about a Policy Order that requires a study and the amount of work\nand time that is spent on unreal issues. He spoke about the time drain on\nemployees is hard on everyone. Councillor Cheung noted that macro stuff is\nbeing done well. He explained that he asked how to effect the IT budget and\nthat he followed the instructions given by the City Manager. The City Charter\nis set up to limit the power of the City Council and the City Council has\ndiluted power and there is currently more transparency.\n\nVice Mayor McGovern applauded the City staff and employees who work for the\ncity. He added that the City Council has to be respectful of the City\nManager's time and it is hard for an elected official to respond to a\nconstituent that they cannot help them. Mr. Rossi explained that things that\nare not feasible may not go forward.\n\nCouncillor Mazen stated that the productive tension is the balance of what is\nappropriate. The process needs flexibility and needs input from the City\nCouncil. The City Council can get behind the budget and he wanted more leeway\nto create a budget that all are happy with. City Manager Rossi stated that\nthis is not the way it works. It is his responsibility to prepare a budget.\nCouncillor Mazen suggested that the preparation of the budget with City\nCouncil input may cause delay. Mr. Rossi stated that the City Council input is\nin the goal setting session. He stated that the laws on the budget must be\nread; they are written to protect the public. He cautioned about the loss of\nstate aid. Councillor Mazen wanted consensus building so that there is input\ninto the budget and asked how the goal setting sessions make their way into\nthe budget process. Councillor Cheung informed the committee that he wanted\nparticipatory budgeting and there was a Finance Committee hearing and now\nCambridge has participatory budgeting.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that his frustration is that the goal setting\nprocess was unproductive. Mr. Rossi stated that for goal setting process the\ncity will hire a consultant to hear what the City Council wants and then the\nconsultant will have a feeling of how things were done.\n\nVice Mayor McGovern stated that the School Department has guidelines which\nlists the values that have to be in the budget. Mr. Rossi stated that this is\ndone on a departmental level all the time. Vice Mayor McGovern asked if it\nwould be more helpful if the City Council meet and listed things they wanted\nin the budget. Councillor Carlone stated that he wanted more clarity on the\nimpact. Councillor Mazen wanted to make the process easier with less pain.\n\nVice Mayor McGovern stated that Cambridge is in the envy of all other\ncommunities.\n\nCouncillor Cheung stated that he does not want to hire a consultant. The City\nCouncil can have committee hearings and report out overarching goals.\nCouncillor Mazen stated that doing this in committees has too many moving\nparts. Councillor Cheung noted that there has been consistency in finding\nmoney in the budget for emergency needs.\n\nMr. Rossi explained the process when an idea is brought to him. Councillor\nCarlone spoke about City Council consensus. Mr. Rossi stated it is a good\nidea; but it is one on a list of good ideas. Councillor Mazen spoke about\ndeveloping a patter for the City Council on what works and does not work.\nThese discussion need to be before the City Council.\n\nAt this time Assistant City Manager for Fiscal Affairs, Mr. DePasquale, gave\nan update on the FY 16. He stated that the City Council is not giving\nthemselves credit for the impact the City Council has on the budget. The\nbudget process development takes a lot of time. The budget has grown 25\npositions and it will increase in FY17. Mr. Rossi stated that this is due to\nthe increase in programing. Mitigation funds has been purposed in the\ncommunity and the money is helping nonprofits. Mr. Rossi stated that he is\nhearing that early childcare is only a City issue and he wanted the City\nCouncil to respond to this comment when they meet with the School Committee.\nHe spoke about the City initiatives created by the City Council: such as\nSTEAM, vulnerability assessment and early childcare.\n\nPublic Works Commissioner O'Riordan stated that there was a capital meeting\nheld on street reconstruction. For FY15 $8 million was allocated; this year $4\nmillion is allocated. He stated that in FY15 budget hearing heard about the\nproblem of tree wells and money was put into budget to deal with this as well\nas funding for truck barriers; street clean and recycling. Mr. Rossi added\nthat Net Zero is a big cost to the City.\n\nMs. Semonoff stated that second position was added DHSP for civic engagement.\nFunding was expanded for legal services for eviction protection and for food\npantries. She stated that Baby U was created from a request from the City\nCouncil; transitional jobs program was also grown from a City Council request.\n\nCommissioner Haas spoke about providing services for the most vulnerable and\nthis is done by collaboration with many City departments. He stated that the\nwork with youth has shown that there is a decrease in juvenile arrest. He\nspoke about the work with the elderly. Police work has been acknowledged\nnationally. He explained that 93.8% of his budget is salaries. He has two\nsocial workers on staff; this is not seen in other police departments. We are\nbuilding and working towards a healthier community.\n\nMr. Rossi spoke about the Law Department budget working to provide better\nprocess on enforcement. He added that the City Clerk's has a great computer\nsystem and will be an advanced City Clerk's Office in the years to come.\n\nAssistant City Manager for Community Development, Iram Farooq, spoke about the\n$3.3 million allocated for planning. The Net Zero process impact on the budget\nis a 25 year plan. The City Council has prioritized Planning Board\nimprovements; funding for urban design and traffic analysis. She stated that\nthe Planning Board will begin streaming their meetings. There have been\nupdates to the inclusionary zoning; regional engagement; Mayors Compact, etc.,\nHubway; bike network planning and bike racks. Mr. Rossi stated that no public\nproject is created without input from the City Council. He stated that the\nCity Council's fingerprints are all over the budget. This is a partnership and\na clear City Council message helps the administration to implement.\n\nMr. DePasquale stated that 98% of property tax bills are paid on time and the\nCity is at 99% to date. Last year there was a 16.28% increase in residential\nvalue. He spoke about the small number of application for abatements. He\nexplained that revenue is coming in strong. Departmental budgets are in good\nshape. Budget issue this year is snow expenditure of $600,000 over what was\nappropriated. The expenditure is generally around $2 million. He stated that\nthe School Department has a projected $500,000 - $700,000 deficit. These items\nwill come to the City Council for a supplemental appropriation. Mr. Rossi\nstated that the benefit level for employees has changed due to City Council\ninput. Mr. DePasquale stated that there is a $1-2 million surplus in salaries;\nhealth insurance has a surplus with a zero increase. Mr. Rossi stated that\nfree cash should never be spent down; it is the City's insurance policy\n\nMr. DePasquale gave an overview of FY17 budget. The School Department has the\nbiggest gap; and the gap is closing without affecting the students. There is a\n5.5% projected tax levy increase at the start of the process for FY17. He\nspoke about the modest tax levy increase. Water rates have had a zero increase\nfor 5-6 years; sewer rates a 3.2% increase and it may go up greater this year.\nCity is growing and the City needs to keep an eye on the budget and property\ntax increases.\n\nCouncillor Carlone thanked Vice Mayor McGovern for convening this hearing.\nVice Mayor McGovern added that he will have a hearing on the goals.\n\nAt 6:29 PM Vice Mayor McGovern opened the hearing to public comment.\n\nMr. Rashid stated that there is not enough money in the budget for the\nhomeless.\n\nAt 6:30 PM public comment was closed.\n\nCouncillor Cheung encouraged the City Manager to have the City Council\ncommittees hold hearings on the goals. He suggested having ideas held in a\nholding meeting for all new ideas.\n\nVice Mayor McGovern stated that after the Roundtable/working meeting with the\nSchool Committee on March 28, 2016 he wanted to hold smaller hearings with the\nCity Council and the School Committee to have questions answered before the\nbudget hearing so that the budget hearing is on budget items rather than\ncurriculum issues. Mr. Rossi stated that departments are already executing\ntheir plan and when the City Council throws another program in it is\ndifficult.\n\nCouncillor Mazen stated that it is important to address homelessness. It is\nunfair to say that nothing is done and that government does not have the\namount of resources to address this issue. He stated that the problem is\nlarge. Vice Mayor McGovern spoke about the departmental services that have\nhelped homelessness.\n\nVice Mayor McGovern thanked all attendees.\n\nThe hearing adjourned at 6:39 PM. on a motion by Councillor Cheung. .\n\n![](/Citizens/GetImage.aspx?Type=25&ID=/Aspose.Words.46109844-1a3f-4c48-9a13-f1e3de3483b4.001.png)\n\n5\n\n"

Denise Simmons  \n  \nCall to Order\n\nThe City Council held a public hearing on Wednesday, February 24, 2016\nbeginning at 5:30 P.M. in the Sullivan Chamber.\n\nThe purpose of the hearing was to conduct a public hearing to discuss a zoning\npetition filed by Peter L. Cohen, et al to amend the Zoning Ordinance to\nrestrict garage development in dimensionally non-conforming lots.\n\nPresent at the hearing were Mayor Simmons, Councillor Devereux, Vice Mayor\nMcGovern, Councillor Mazen, Councillor Cheung Councillor Kelley, Councillor\nMaher, Councillor\n\nToomey, Jeff Roberts, Zoning and Land Use Planner, Community Development\nDepartment (CDD) and City Clerk Donna P. Lopez.\n\nAlso present were Peter Cohen, 11 Donnell Street, Charlie Teague, 23 Edmonds\nStreet,\n\nMayor Simmons presided at the hearing due to Council Committees not being\napproved. She convened the hearing and explained the purpose. She outlined the\nformat of the hearing. She noted that if comments were submitted by e-mail\nthat they would be made part of the record. She then invited the petitioner to\ncome forward.\n\nPetition\n\nThe City Council heard from the petitioner, Mr. Peter L. Cohen, 11 Donnell\nStreet. He stated that he wanted to amend the zoning ordinance in a very\nmodest way that is important to him and his family. He spoke about his\nneighborhood. The neighborhood contains modest two family houses, a few single\nfamily houses and a few triple deckers. His neighbors are friendly, but not\nintrusive. There is a sense of neighborhood. There are young families with\nchildren in the neighborhood. He noted that the scale and architecture of the\nhomes in the neighborhood are located close to and face the street. Most homes\nhave off street parking and there are a few garages which are separate\nstructures tucked behind the homes. He stated that the exceptions are 10 and\n12 Donnell Street have garages that were built into the main structure facing\nthe street in a townhouse style. He further stated that 7B and 7C Donnell\nStreet have a garage facing the street as part of the condominium structure\nbut is located down a driveway and 50 feet from the street. He explained that\nin his residential neighborhood there are no residential units, old or new,\nwith a garage facing the street. He did not want the urban landscape to change\nexcept when there is a compelling reason. He explained why this is an issue to\nbuild a structure where the main feature facing the street is a garage.\nEconomic pressures could dictate an outcome that may alienate the\nneighborhood. He stated that he lives next to property that is the subject of\nredevelopment. He added that there are other non-conforming lots that can be\nrezoned and will over time will be subject to the same redevelopment pressures\nand bad outcome. The amendment that he drafted applies to other properties and\ncommented about unintended consequences. He spoke about the 9 Donnell Street\nwhich is the subject of the amendment which is a two family worker's cottage\nbuilt in the l850's. Mr. Cohen proceeded with his presentation\n\nHe stated that the house at 9 Donnell Street is relatively small with a two\ncar garage on a lot that is 6,000 square feet. This property was owned for\nsixty years by one owner but recently is in the hands of a developer. Because\nof the narrowness of the lot there is a push to remove the existing house. The\ncurrent owner has brought the proposal to the Planning Board which has\napproved the proposal in principal which would have two different structures\nin the style of a townhouse, with a courtyard in the middle with underground\nparking underneath. The neighbors were told by the property owners that there\nis an alternative and they can build by right one long structure with a garage\nstructure in front, view I is what the structure would look like from the\nstreet. It is his understanding that this is what the developer wants to build\non the site with Planning Board approval. During the Planning Board hearing\nthe Planning Board members questioned whether the development was economically\nviable. He stated that the zoning could be amended to prohibit this or the\nPlanning Board could grant a special permit. He wanted to get ahead of this\nsituation before the structure is built. He depicted a reasonable development\nthat has a garage. He spoke about the technical and spiritual aspects of this\nproposal. He stated that 101 Orchard Street depicts frontage of a house and a\ngarage. This amendment would only effect a narrow group of properties that are\ndimensional non-conforming lots where there is a garage. He spoke of the law\nof unintended consequences. He commented that developers are looking at lots\nas an economic proposition. He wanted development done in a tasteful way that\ndoes not upset neighborhood values. He stated that within the first 50 feet of\nland a garage should not be built, but could apply to the Planning Board for a\nspecial permit. He explained the structure of his petition. He stated that\nSection B (2) of his petition deals with demolition during the pendency period\nof the special permit application and covers historical signification\nproperties that are being torn down. This will codify the current practice.\nMr. Cohen stated that Section C deals with if the petition is challenged by\ndevelopers and struck down this would just prohibit garages in the front 50\nfeet. He spoke about the memo written by Community Development start. He\nstated that language in his petition needs to be clarified. It is not the\nintention to prohibit parking rather where parking is put. He wanted to find a\nbalance for the neighborhood and developer with neighborhood values being\nprimary. He noted that the language in his petition needs refinement.\n\nPeter L. Cohen, petitioner - Presentation (Attached)\n\nRelated Agenda Items\n\n1. A zoning petition has been received From Peter L. Cohen, with regard to a proposed amendment to the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance to restrict garage development in dimensionally non-conforming lots.\n\nAPP 2016 # 3\n\n2. A communication was received from Donna P. Lopez, City Clerk, transmitting information on the Cohen Zoning Petition - Legal Ad.\n\nCOF 2016 # 5\n\n3. That a public hearing be held before the City Council or, if appointed, the Ordinance Committee on the zoning petition filed by Peter L. Cohen.\n\nO #12 2016\n\nCouncillor Kelley\n\nCity staff\n\nMayor Simmons requested Mr. Roberts to explain the memo from CDD.\n\nMr. Roberts spoke that the memo prepared for the review of the planning\nissues. He stated that the Planning Board will hear the petition on March 8.\nThe memo contains an overview of the petition. The full impact of the petition\nhave not been fully studied and Residence B is a common zoning district which\ncontains about 4,000 lots and have not studied how many of these lots are non-\nconforming. It is not typical for lots to be narrower than the 50 foot lot\nwidth. In the current zoning ordinance between Articles Five and Six there are\na set of different requirements pertaining to parking facilities, both in\nstructured parking facilities such as garages as well as surface parking.\nThere are restrictions currently in place for smaller lots and there is more\nflexibility. The issue raised with this proposal is the balance between the\nrequirement that housing when created has to provide parking at one space per\nunit and must meet the dimensional requirement in the zoning verses having\nadditional restrictions that would limit where the parking is allowed to go\nand be designed on the lot. Relief is sought by a special permit from the\nPlanning Board or variance from the Board of Zoning Appeal. Mr. Roberts added\nthat the petitioner did not some of the technical points made. One is that the\nproposed provision is cited in Article Ten, the procedures section, of the\nzoning. What is being proposed is more of a development control and belongs in\nArticle 5 of the zoning. He commented on the terminology of multi-family which\nis standard term in zoning and building codes that refers to three units or\nmore. Sections B and C in the petition that discusses procedures for special\npermit relief provisions are unusual compared to the way that special permits\nare typically provided for in the zoning. When there is a special permit\nprovision there is criteria cited and if the Planning Board or BZA finds that\nthe project meets the zoning requirements and the criteria outlined in the\nzoning then the special permit will be granted; variances require proving\nhardship to have the zoning requirement relieved. These provisions if passed\nneeds to be reviewed to determine the legal appropriateness of the language.\n\nPeter L. Cohen, et al., Zoning Petition - Community Development Memo.\n\nPublic Comment\n\nAt this time Mayor Simmons opened the hearing to public comment.\n\nCharles Teague, 23 Edmonds Street, stated that he is the project manager for\nthe lot that is the target of this petition. He noted that this project is\ntargeted because it is next door to Attorney Cohen. He stated that this\npetition is illegal. He noted that for Part A there is a letter from the\ntrustee of 9 Donnell Street, Mr. Robert McHale has been sent to the City\nCouncil and is written protest to the petition ([COMMUNICATION\n#3](http://cambridgema.iqm2.com/Citizens/Detail_LegiFile.aspx?Frame=&MeetingID=1553&MediaPosition=&ID=2056&CssClass=)).\nThe memo points that Part A is illegal in Massachusetts and alleged that this\nis reverse spot zoning. This petition singles out one or more parcels and is\nmore restrictive than other lots in the same area. He noted that the memo from\nMr. McHale points out that it is unclear why the proposed requirements will\nonly apply to such non-conforming lots and not to other lots in the same\ndistrict. He stated that the quantity and characteristics of the parcels that\nwill be affected by the Cohen petition must be known and that the petitioner\ndid not do this research. He stated that he has had previous petitions that\nhave been enacted by the City Council. He spoke of a previous petition\nsubmitted that failed to pass that contained language that a special permit\nmay normally be granted to be in compliance with state law that a special\npermit may be granted. The public was questioning why special permits were\nalways approved. He noted that it was disappointing that the City Council did\nnot seek a legal opinion on this that was offered by the City Solicitor. He\nannounced that the approval process is set by state case law. He noted that\nPart B of the petition tries to change the approval process and override state\nlaw. He concluded that this petition is a waste of time because it is illegal.\n\nJohn Tittmann, 29 Kelley Street, spoke about the livability of the streets in\nCambridge. This petition addresses an important issues. Street need to be\nbuilt and a zoning process created that insures that streets are for people to\nwalk on; not designed to make it more comfortable for cars. Convenient streets\ncreated for automobiles make it dangerous for walking. He stated that putting\ngarage doors against street sidewalks is not good for urbanism.\n\nBill Wendel, 97A Garden Street, stated that garages will fade in importance in\nour lifetime. He stated that the question needs to be asked is what the future\nof garages is. Garages are being turned into livable space.\n\nOn a motion of Councillor Devereux public comment closed at 6:10 PM on a voice\nvote of six members.\n\nCity Council Discussion\n\nCouncillor Mazen agreed with the petitioners that cars are a dying breed and\ngarages need to comport with certain ascetic qualities. He expressed his\nfrustration with the neighbor/developer conflicts and that there is immense\nroom for a win-win situation in this matter and that filing a zoning petition\nis a last resort. There is little attempt to make the developer happy because\nin this case the developer is someone in the neighborhood who owns property\nand wants to make money from the property. He stated properties should not be\nallowed to make money; it should be used for housing. In this situation the\ndesigns are not unseemly; the neighborhood could have helped with the designs.\nHe noted that the antagonism is such that it would be difficult to arrive at a\nwin-win situation. He felt that the reverse spot zoning character of this\npetition is illegal. He wants to say yes and this petition is not working in\nthis vein. He expressed his frustration with this situation and wished\nneighborhoods could solve these problems substantively.\n\nCouncillor Devereux questioned Mr. Roberts if there is problem with garages in\nRes. B would CDD have been thinking about this otherwise. Mr. Roberts\nresponded that this is not an issue that has been brought to his intention. He\nstated that he was not aware of garages being put into the front of small\nresidential lots. The project cited by the petitioner is a case before the\nPlanning Board and the deals with two separate structures on a lot. He stated\nthat the provision of the zoning causes the developers to put forth a single\nstructure design that is deliberately unattractive because the provisions of\nthe zoning stated that the Planning Board has to make a determination that the\ndevelopment of two structures is superior to a single structure. Councillor\nDevereux noted that as long as this petition is active the developer is\nblocked from doing anything. She questioned if the special permit is granted\ndoes this petition stop the demolition and the development is less\neconomically viable the longer there is delay. Mr. Roberts responded that the\nspecial permit was decided but the decision has not filed. He further stated\nthat because the decision was not filed before the petition was advertised and\nif the zoning were adopted it would be effective retroactively to the date\nwhen it was first advertised. If the City Council choses to adopt the petition\nthe Donnell Street project would be subject to petition because the special\npermit has not been filed before the first advertisement date. The current\nstatus of the Special Permit depends on what the City Council decides to do.\nThe Inspectional Services Department will not issue a building permit if the\nproject is in this uncertain stage of not knowing if the project conforms to\nthe zoning. Before a building permit is issued this petition must be resolved.\n\nCouncillor Maher added that the work done would be done at jeopardy due to the\npetition. Mr. Roberts agreed that if a building permit were issued the\ndeveloper would be building at risk and if the City Council adopted the\npetition the developer would have to alter the project or seek additional\nrelief. Councillor Maher commented that there is more going on than what is\nhappening at Donnell Street. This is an extremely tight street and\nneighborhood and people are frustrated. He understands the frustration when\npeople want to change the neighborhood. He is eager to hear what the Planning\nBoard will say about this petition and how many properties this does effects.\nHe added that this neighborhood has been underseiged and the City Council has\na responsibility to act on the changes to this neighborhood. He stated that\nchanges will be coming to Concord Avenue.\n\nVice Mayor McGovern stated that he hoped that issues are resolved in a\ncollaborative way. He stated that there is an issue on Kinnaird Street where a\nsecond dwelling was built with a garage in front that has caused concern for\nthe neighbors. He wanted a legal opinion and what the PB has to say. He wanted\nto hear the risk that the City is taking on this matter. He stated that there\nis creditability on this. He wanted a legal opinion.\n\nMayor Simmons stated that this petition could be referred to the Ordinance\nCommittee.\n\nCouncillor Toomey moved to keep the matter in committee. The motion carried on\na voice vote of 6 members.\n\nThe following e-mails were received and made part of the report.\n\nI.  Communications\n\n1. A communication was received from Mike Phillips, 57 Madison Ave, in opposition to the Cohen zoning petition.\n\n2. A communication was received from Dexter Eames, 6 Avon Place, in opposition to the Cohen zoning petition.\n\n3.

            "aceladescription": "I am hereby requesting the appropriation of $150,000 from Free Cash to the\nGeneral Fund Human Services Salaries and Wages account ($60,000) and to the\nGeneral Fund Human Services Other Ordinary Maintenance Account ($90,000) to be\nused to support the beginning implementation work of the Early Childhood Task\nForce\u2019s recommendations.  \n  \nAs you recall, in November, the Early Childhood Task Force delivered its\nreport to a joint meeting of the City Council and School Committee. The\npowerful vision for early childhood that guided the development of the report\nwas:  \n\nAll children in Cambridge receive high quality early education and care from\nbirth through third grade. As a result, all children enter school ready to\nthrive academically, socially, emotionally and continue to do so through third\ngrade and beyond.  \n\nThe report included a set of recommendations to the City to support the\ndevelopment of an early childhood system. The Task Force was made up of city\nand school department representatives, parents, health and early childhood\nexperts from community based organizations and family childcare settings. With\nsupport from national experts in the field, we reviewed the research to\nidentify best practices nationally and locally. We engaged in a needs\nassessment process, surveying local providers and doing focus groups with\nparents, principals, teachers, early childhood providers and others. What\nemerged from the research and the needs assessment confirmed the availability\nof many strong programs and services within Cambridge, but also confirmed the\nsignificant challenges families and providers face without a coherent system\nthat links families, early childhood providers, and the schools. The Task\nForce recognized that it would be a multi-year ongoing effort to build an\neffective early childhood system that would improve the outcomes for\nCambridge\u2019s children.  \n  \nThe report proposed that a critical first step in this process was to create\nan effective Birth through Third Grade governance structure tasked with\nturning the recommendations of this report into a full-fledged strategic plan\nwith measurable goals and benchmarks. The governance structure will include\nthe full range of stakeholders in the Cambridge\u2019s early education and care\ncommunity including families, early childhood providers, school and city\nofficials, higher education partners and health/mental health partners. The\ngovernance body will be charged with overseeing the development and\nimplementation of the strategic plan. Also critical to the implementation of\nthe plan is the development of agreed upon quality standards in early learning\nsettings since Cambridge\u2019s children are served in a diverse array of programs\nand settings. Family support and family engagement play a central role in the\nEarly Childhood Task Force report, and developing strategies and benchmarks in\nthose areas is also critical.  \n  \nIn November, I had indicated that I would be returning to the City Council\nwith a request for an appropriation for start-up funds to be used in this\nfiscal year to position the City to begin the implementation work in the next\nfiscal year. The funds would be used to hire the Early Childhood Director and\nthe Program Quality Specialist and to work with our consultants and key\nstakeholders to develop a significant portion of the draft strategic plan,\nwhich will include preliminary process and outcome benchmarks for governance,\nquality, access and family engagement.  \n  \nThe costs for start-up in this fiscal year are $150,000. Of that amount,\n$60,000 represents the initial salary for the two positions for the last part\nof FY16 and funding to continue the work to support the Birth to Grade 3\nalignment work with community providers. An additional $90,000 will support\nthe work with stakeholders in developing the draft strategic plan and draft\noutcomes and benchmarks, development and analysis of alternate scholarship\nsystems for supporting access within quality programs, and to explore models\nfor a quality pilot with community sites. We will also be developing more\naccurate information for the proposed budget for FY17 by the spring, but we\nanticipate that the costs will be approximately 1.3 million dollars. Those\ncosts would grow by approximately another one million dollars for year 2,\nFY18.\n\n"

Carlone, Councillor E. Denise Simmons, Councillor Marc\nMcGovern, Councillor Nadeem Mazen, Susanne Rasmussen, Director, Environmental\nand Transportation Planning Division of Community Development Department, Owen\nO\u2019Riordan, Public Works Commissioner, Kathy Watkins, City Engineer, Sam\nLipson, Director, Environmental Health, Public Health Department and City\nClerk  \nDonna P.

Durbin, 78 Pearson Avenue, Somerville, Andrea Wilder, 12\nArlington Street and Robert Winters, 366 Broadway.\n\nCouncillor Kelley convened the hearing and explained the purpose. He submitted\nan agenda for the hearing (ATTACHMENT A). He explained the format. He would\ngive his overview, then City staff and general discussion. The Climate Change\nVulnerability Assessment Report (CCVA) is focused on sea level rise and storm\nwater surge, precipitation and temperature with three planning horizons.\nExperts talk about things using terms that regular people do not understand.\nHe stated that if the City wants the CCVA report taken seriously it needs to\nbe understandable from the public perspective. He spoke about the need for\ngraphics rather than text. He stated that this needs to be sold similar to an\ninsurance project. He asked city staff to explain the CCVA process.\n\nSusanne Rasmussen, CDD, stated that the themes were selected from\nconversations with climate change experts and scientist. Heat, sea level rise\nand storm surge were identified as threats. The findings from the climate\nchange study will be published in February. The scope of the plan is being\nfinalized. The biggest challenge is to integrate this with the city-wide plan\nwhich will cover the preparedness plan. She stated that on December 3rd the\nCity held a public meeting to discuss climate change issues and how to address\nthe threats. She stated that there is a regional collaboration about climate\nchange preparedness.\n\nCommissioner O'Riordan stated that smaller groups in the community will meet\nto have conversations about climate change, to see the impacts and to\nunderstand the concerns of various communities about climate change. He stated\nthat the City takes climate change impacts seriously over the short and long\nterm. There needs to be consensus for change.\n\nSam Lipson spoke about the health aspects in the assessment. This is meant to\ncreate a realistic view. The direct relationship increase in heat and\nmortality is impressive. What is the additional stress to a population? There\nwas a challenge in the assessment to talk about the health effect\nappropriately and there is not a lot of consensus on what is going to happen\nwith temperature increases. He stated that in the City\u2019s technical report you\nwill see more talk about disease vectors like mosquito borne illnesses, etc.\nidentified as issues to be concerned about as they relate to climate change.\nThis is meant to be look at a system risk perspective and includes the keeping\nof food, food safety and distribution problems. Systemic risks such as power\noutages will be considered. This type of information is not in the report that\nhas been released but will be in a future white paper that talks about what\nhappens under various likely scenarios.\n\nCouncillor Kelley asked how we manage the information, knowledge and events\nsuch as the public meetings to be held. How is the public informed of the\nmeetings? How do we get a representative public involved? Ms. Rasmussen noted\nthat all the public meetings are advertised and the web site will reflect all\nactivities. The smaller meetings will be arranged from direct outreach. Mr.\nO'Riordan stated that neighborhood groups, pastors, business organization will\nbe utilized with the hope that this information be transferred to other\ninterested persons. Extreme heat and flooding are primary means that climate\nchange will affect us with secondary issues such as power outages, food\nsecurity and then illnesses. The initial thoughts are for City staff to go to\norganizations in the community and ask people who are interested in this to\nparticipate with the City in this matter. It is a new area for City staff and\nthey want to be flexible in their approach. The CCVA is a stress test and as\nwe move to the preparedness plan additional stresses will be studied and put\ninto the public domain. The assessment took three years and the planning is\nprobably going to take two. The best science and engineering was used for the\nassessment and the complex modeling required special computing access which\nled to delays. He stated that meetings have been scheduled for Harvard Square\nand Mid-Cambridge neighborhood association. Ms. Rasmussen stated that all\nactivities will be posted when they are finalized. The two meetings are not\nposted now. Councillor Kelley wanted to go to the web site and map out the\nCity meetings scheduled. Commissioner O'Riordan stated that staff is being\nasked to attend association meetings and are on their agenda for 5-10 minutes.\nHe stated that Councillor Kelley's wishes will be respected to post the\nmeetings.\n\nCouncillor McGovern stated that neighborhood organizations are good places to\ngo. He stated that only the most robust neighborhood organizations represent a\ntrue segment of the neighbors. He suggested working with the school\ndepartment, perhaps through their curriculum, and to have larger meetings with\nthe community. He stated that outreach at the neighborhood organizations are\nonly a piece of the notification process. He suggested using the City Council\nto promote these meetings as well. Ms. Rasmussen stated that the City-wide\nMaster Plan outreach will be a significant way to talk to people. This will\nstart in the Alewife area. The CCVA is such a critical part of forward\nplanning.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that there are critical zones that will be impacted.\nHe suggested having meetings in these areas. He suggested using television and\ncable. He spoke of the impact of state bridges and roads blocking effective\ndrainage and making flooding worse. How has the state been involved?\nCommissioner O'Riordan it was through DOT\u2019s Central Artery study that the City\nobtained its modeling. He also stated that Department of Conservation &\nResources (DCR) has looked at their bridges and dams (Craddick Dam on Mystic\nRiver and the Charles River Dam). He spoke about the importance of having\nthese systems operate correctly even for less significant storm events and the\ncritical importance of having the pumps working for major events. The City is\nlooking at regional flood prevention efforts, especially for big events, and\nMass DOT must be involved.\n\nCouncillor Carlone spoke about Route 2 development, the fact that Route 2 acts\nas a type of dam, and the option of expanding wetlands and greenspace and\nlooking at water retention. Commissioner O'Riordan stated that maps produced\nare results of rare events projected for 2070. But smaller events, 5-10 years,\nneed to be understood as well as even with non-major events, flooding can\noverwhelm the bridges and drainage systems and once on the site, water cannot\neasily be removed. He stated that the smaller events can benefit from storm\nwater management planning but that, realistically, there is not much that can\nbe done for major storm water events like a 100 year storm. In that case, our\nefforts are simply going to be inconsequential.\n\nCouncillor Simmons spoke about the importance of outreach to the community and\nits two part nature - normal, customary people and the harder to reach people.\nShe suggested looking at the neighborhood and proposing to reach 10% of the\nneighborhood and break it down to ethnicity. She wanted to see this data\nbroken down. She wanted a quantifiable way of reaching the community. She\nstated that how the outreach is done must be very creative to figure out how\nspecific populations find this issue relevant. We are being creative to reach\nout to these communities she suggested using the Church service as a method of\nnotification, to include going to services, offering meals and so forth.\n\nSam Lipson stated that the conversation is just beginning about outreach now\nthat the CCVA is done, especially how to reach people who are not usually\nreached. He stated that the Public Health Department had to get creative with\nthe types of questions asked and used focus groups to formulate the questions\nas was done with the Community Health Assessment. There are existing groups,\nsuch as Baby U, that can also add communications value. He spoke about the\nnumber of people who responded to the survey on line. Climate change\nvulnerability reflects are old concerns, not new ones. Being prepared is not\nnew. He stated that vulnerability, and preparedness, is a household by\nhousehold issue as each household has a different set of concerns. It\u2019s about\ngetting ready for a snowstorm and more. Councillor Simmons spoke about people\nparticipating to keep themselves safe. She stated that this needs to be multi-\nlingual and constant, maybe use \u201cClimate Ambassadors\u201d to provide a level of\nauthenticity. She stated that the City Council may be able to engage more\npeople to attend these meeting. She spoke about poverty and access to good\nfood. She asked if there is a correlation that poorer areas are more\nvulnerable. Mr. Lipson stated that they are starting to identify resources\ncommunities rely on for flooding and, sometimes, heat risks. Councillor\nSimmons asked if asthma was correlated to poverty. Commissioner O'Riordan\nresponded in the affirmative. Councillor Simmons noted that the City Council\ncan help provide resources in these key communities. If the eastern part of\nthe City is more vulnerability, then the community benefit mitigation funds\ncould be used in those neighborhoods. She also noted that it will be necessary\nto make repeat visits to various places at different times.\n\nCouncillor Kelley opened the hearing to public comment.\n\nMegan Brooks, 103 Inman Street, stated that she has not read any of the\nreports. The general planning should be connected to the City. She stated that\npreparing and protecting the environment is bigger than any other issue of the\nCity. She wanted preparedness put above any other thing in the City. If the\nland is overdeveloped it will be harder to prepare for these problems.\n\nAndrea Wilder, 12 Arlington Street, became aware of this 5-6 years ago when\nshe learned from the Boston Harbor Association that the height of the water\nfrom Boston Harbor would affect the Moakley Steps. She stated that Cambridge\ndoes not know what Boston will be doing. She stated that her concern is the\ntransportation for the Redline to stay dry and preventing this subway from\nbecoming a river. She stated that open spaces act like sponges by planting\ntrees. She would like green space increased with trees that provide shade. She\nspoke about building material and shingles used. She stated that CDD and\nspecial permits requirements need to be reviewed and changed to reflect the\nreality of climate change to use non-heat sink building materials and so\nforth. She spoke about changes in insurance policies that will affect homes\nand building and how buildings will have to, like the Spaulding building in\nCharlestown, compensate for climate change. She stated that making building\nflood proofing should be part of the regulations. She spoke about reviewing\nrequirements for new buildings and retrofitting old buildings. She suggested\nthat when distributing information to groups, maps would be a good tool. Ms.\nRasmussen stated that this is what the preparedness plan will consist of. The\nCCVA will focus the City to look at the tree canopy and what are the\nstrategies needed for a new buildings and providing flood proofing.\n\nJan Devereux, 255 Lakeview Avenue, noted her communications background and\nasked what the message is. The PowerPoint is too overwhelming to take to\nchurches and organizations, it is important not to be too alarmist. She\nsuggested speaking about events in people's life time and she stated that she\nmay not be around in 2070. She suggested using 2050. She noted that specifying\nrisk to specific populations, for example garden apartment dwellers, garbage\ncollectors, would be useful. She stated that what can be done to lessen this\nfrom happening would be more effective.\n\nAnn Durbin stated that she read the technical part of the report. It is\nimportant that the City address the health issues for infectious disease. She\nfurther stated that outreach should include talking to health practitioners.\nShe stated that workers who work outside are more vulnerable and that this\nshould be addressed.\n\nRobert Winters, 366 Broadway, stated that, basically, Alewife is a teacup. He\nspoke about the railroad and the inadequate culverts to convey water across.\nHe spoke about storm drains in the Port and Mid-Cambridge areas. He asked what\nabsolutely needs to be done. He spoke about the method that was used in\nLowell. He noted that the MBTA\u2019s flood protection plan may have worked had\npeople understood what they needed to do, but the flashboards were not used\nand Kenmore Square flooded. When the report was presented there was a focus on\nthe loss of power generation. There is a problem in Cambridge with the aging\nelectrical infrastructure, a \u201cwires in dirt\u2019 power distribution system. It\nfails during the highest load. He stated that he did not see this addressed in\nthe CCVA. Commissioner O'Riordan stated that as we move throughout the plan\nthe secondary issues such as communications will be addressed but they were\nnot part of the CCVA. He stated that he agreed with the statement about the\nelectrical infrastructure. The primary effort is new development and new\nprojects not upgrading older systems but perhaps the CCVA will help create\nleverage to improve more vulnerable existing systems. The Alewife sub-station\nis an issue and an RFP has been put out by Eversource. He spoke about\nbuildings where people can go when there is an emergency. More people are\nlooking at \u201cislanding.\u201d Ms. Rasmussen stated that low carbon energy study RFP\nwill be put out next year which may help islanding.\n\nCouncillor Kelley commented that this conversation is daunting. How can this\nbe manageable? This was flooding and heating. What happens when people cannot\ngo into their building when it is too hot? Low carbon energy RFP is tied to\nresiliency. He wanted to know that the 1500 City employees can communicate\nabout these issues. The schools need to be part of our resiliency disaster\nplanning. Councillor Carlone spoke about communications being out in a flood.\nWe do not want to over emphasize the fear.\n\nMr. Lipson stated that the Public Health Department it is about preparing for\nbad news. He spoke about FEMA duct tape instructions being silly but\nwidespread. Emphasizing evacuation is not practical; keep the message\npractical and relevant. This is not new stuff. There are lessons to be learned\nfrom incidents that have occurred. He spoke about the problem with delivering\nmedicine by the mail during Hurricane Sandy in Hoboken, NJ. The solution was\nto have a pharmacist filling prescriptions in City Hall.\n\nCouncillor Kelley stated that he does not think that there are two years to\nthink about instances. Councillor McGovern stated he did not know what an\nevacuation plan is. Is there a set plan if there is an emergency and how is\nthe community notified. Mr. Lipson stated the Red Cross has approved\nfacilities beforehand in the event of an emergency and that the Fire\nDepartment\u2019s Emergency Planning Committee handles this.\n\nMs. Durbin asked if the City has its own radio station. She suggested having a\nhand cranked radio. Commissioner O'Riordan stated that DPW staff engages with\nother departments and lays out the plan, much as happens with snow operations.\nCouncillor Simmons suggested looking at previous plans.\n\nMegan Brooks stated that universities have enormous resources. She stated that\na crank radio is a good idea. She stated that information should also be in\npaper form to all residents.\n\nMs. Devereux stated that a communication department figures out what message\nneeds to be sent out and that perhaps less \u201cemergency communications\u201d and more\ndepartment communications would be a good idea. Ms. Rasmussen stated that\nwhere the shelters are located are unknown. Commissioner O'Riordan stated that\nLee Gianetti is the Communication Director in the Office of the City Manager\nand there are two communication specialist in Public Works. Mr. Lipson stated\nthat better communication has occurred. He noted that the City\u2019s use of social\nmedia is improving. Commissioner O'Riordan spoke about the snow emergency of\nlast year and the collaboration between Public Works and the City Manager's\noffice.\n\nCouncillor Kelley stated that if this is the challenge of our times better\ncommunication needs to be done.\n\nCouncillor Kelley thanked all those present for their attendance.\n\nThe hearing adjourned at 4:34 P.M.\n\nFor the Committee,\n\nCouncillor Craig Kelley, Chair\n\nPublic Safety Committee\n\n"

Toomey, Jr.\n\n|  \n  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Ordinance Committee held a public hearing on November 19, 2015 beginning\nat\n\n2:16 P.M. in the Sullivan Chamber.\n\nThe purpose of the hearing was to discuss a petition filed by Patrick W.\nBarrett III, et al. to amend the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance by amending\nArticle 2.000 (\u201cDefinitions\u201d) and Article 4.000, Section 4.22 (\u201cAccessory\nApartment\u201d).  (ATTACHMENT\n<http://www2.cambridgema.gov/cityclerk/AppsPetitionsOrder.cfm?item_id=11436>\nA).\n\nPresent at the hearing were Vice Mayor Dennis A. Benzan and Councillor Dennis\nJ. Carlone, Co-Chairs of the Committee, Councillor Craig Kelley, Mayor David\nP. Maher,\n\nCouncillor Marc C. McGovern, Councillor E. Denise Simmons, Councillor Timothy\nJ. Toomey, Jr., Jeff Roberts, Zoning and Land Use Planner, Community\nDevelopment Department (CDD) and City Clerk Donna P. Lopez.\n\nAlso present were Patrick Barrett, 234 Broadway, Marilee Meyer, 10 Dana\nStreet, Doug Brown, 35 Standish Street, Carol O'Hare, 172 Magazine Street,\nDave Lewis, 58 Regent Street, Tony Madan, Pebble Gifford, 15 Hilliard Street,\nAmy Munsat, 71 Standish Street, Jan Lewis, 58 Regent Street, Jan Devereux, 255\nLakeview Avenue, James Williamson, 1000 Jackson Place, Wayne Bingham, Cedar\nStreet and Stephen Kaiser, 191 Hamilton Street.\n\nVice Mayor Benzan convened the hearing and explained the purpose and stated\nthat the hearing is being audio and visually recorded.\n\nThe petitioner, Patrick Barrett, gave a presentation (ATTACHMENT B). He stated\nthat the public process was limited and this petition came about after\ndiscussions with the community and his neighbors. He explained that this\npetition began two years ago. He stated that basement apartments are low\nhanging fruit. He stated that families are faced with difficult decisions of\nbeing over or under-housed. If the petition is adopted as written, housing\nunits will be created. He stated that the current zoning has accessory\nhousing. He stated that the City is constantly looking to increase housing.\nThis is done by density. He stated that the Harvard Defense Fund submitted a\nsimilar petition previously. He stated that there is a significant housing for\nlarge houses. Opportunities across the City can be found to create accessory\nuses. A variance is currently required to do this. He stated that the Master\nPlan for the City and none of the studies will say less housing is needed. The\nMaster Plan wants to preserve the neighborhoods. He had a list of amendments.\nHe stated that the Planning Board had difficulty distinguishing two family\nhouses to allow this. The two family caveat is eliminated. This may be\nsomething for the Master Plan to decide. The proposed changes are outlined in\nthe maps (ATTACHMENT C-1 - C-3); the red are additional units; 1007 additional\nunits will be created without changing the contextual, construction of what is\nexisting. He stated that Part A and Part B effects both sides of the City.\nThis amendment should be used as a tool. He discussed areas that were issues\nfor the Planning Board. He did not want to create an administrative burden and\nhe suggested eliminating the affidavit provision. The last portion refers to\nPart A. He stated that there is no long term effect on neighborhoods and\nparking which were concerns for residents and the Planning Board. The map\nshows where accessory units will be allowed. He eliminated the requirement for\nparking for accessory units because a special permit is required for parking.\nThis purpose of this petition was to create homes and give flexibility to\nhomeowners. This petition gives something to homeowners. He stated that a\nsuggested amendment is that parking is added and could be eliminated by a\nspecial permit. He stated that Part B eliminates GFA space above six feet for\na single or two family homes by as of right or special permit. He noted that\nmany basements have illegal uses. He stated that the Building, Sanitary and\nMunicipal Ordinance do not line up. He stated that under the Building Code\ncurrently in a single or two family home it allowed finishing off a basement\nat 6'8\" or greater. Depending on the FAR a variance or special permit may be\nrequired. He is suggesting that for single and two family homes it is allowed.\nHe is trying to create parity. He stated that in the Sanitary Code spaces that\nare 6'11\" or lower are not livable or habitable. The Municipal Ordinance lines\nup with 6\"11\" GFA. He stated that eliminating height in basement units does\nnot make sense. He stated that there are many units that are unknown by ISD or\nthe Fire Department that are not up to code and are potential hazards. This\ncreates underground units. He asked for allowance for people to use these\nspaces and bring them up to code. He stated that the biggest issue is flooding\nand there are areas in the City where this cannot be done, but this will still\nbe an issue for a 6'11\" basement. He included that this should be allowed in\nlarge commercial spaces. He stated that he owns the property where Toscanni's\nis located and has used basement space for 30 years and now it is a kitchen.\nHe noted that basement spaces are being used. He stated that if the City is\nlooking to find creative ways to use space to rezone a large are to allow\nadditional structure there is already existing basement space that can be\nused. He suggested in his amendment that the special permit provision be\neliminated. He stated that there are open space, set back and height\nrequirements that prevent building throughout the City. These will still\ncontrol what is able to be used and Article 8 would still apply. This is a way\nto create parity for a proposal that has not received support over the years.\nHe explained part B. He stated let us use this space, know where these spaces\nare, what they are being used for and tax the property. We are taking existing\nspace and use it more effectively, preserve the neighborhood, and help\nfamilies.\n\nJeff Roberts noted that the Planning Board heard this petition on October 27,\n2015 and recommended that the petition needed further study. An advance copy\nof the Planning Board recommendation which will be on the agenda for the\nNovember 23rd City Council was distributed (ATTACHMENT D). Mr. Roberts stated\nthat the Planning Board felt that there were some good points to the petition\nsuch as using the existing housing stock with more flexibility, but felt that\nthere were aspect of the proposal that needed further study. Accessory units\noperate in a full set of zoning requirements and development controls and that\nthe challenge be looked at in a comprehensive way and be considered in the\ncity-wide process and establish goals and objectives.\n\nCouncillor McGovern asked if the amendments submitted last night to the City\nCouncil address the Planning Board concerns. Mr. Roberts stated that this is\nthe first time he has seen proposed changes and cannot comment.\n\nVice Mayor Benzan opened public comment at 2:46 PM.\n\nMarilee Meyer, 10 Dana Street stated that she was lost in the details. Her\nimpression is that the petition is a city-wide up zoning for properties that\nmay or may not be appropriate. The Planning Board stated that this is not\nready for prime time and is not directed at affordable housing. Mid-Cambridge\nis the most dense neighborhood but Mr. Barrett is talking about West\nCambridge. This is encouraging infill with some of these properties. She\nstated that parking, entries to the unit, windows and window wells, density,\nnoise and regulations and utilities are concerns. She spoke about the\nrequirement of the Historical Commission regarding foundations. She did not\nwant the historical character of the neighborhood lost. This petition benefits\nthe petitioner.\n\nDoug Brown, 35 Standish Street, signed the petition and it is a valid way to\nget more housing. He agreed with the amendments proposed and limits unintended\nconsequences. He stated people live in sub-standard spaces, have to follow the\nexpensive variances or do the changes illegally. He stated that not every\naccessory unit will benefit or vice versa some additional living space may be\nsought and may be in a basement or attic. Regarding the historical\nsignificance these requirements and rules still apply; approval from\nHistorical Commission is still required. He stated most houses are already\nover on the FAR and when all the requirements are added in not much is left.\nHe supports this proposal and urged the City Council to pass it.\n\nCarol O'Hare, 172 Magazine Street, stated that a major amendment has been\nproposed and reached the City Council last night and did not get circulated\nahead of time. She stated that owner occupied amendment was amended from the\noriginal petition would be dropped. She objected to the initial owner occupied\naccessory apartment because there was no mechanism to ensure owner occupancy\nwould continue if the house was sold. This should continue longer than the\noriginal owner occupancy provision. This amendment was not filed and due to\nthis amendment being major this process needs to start over again. She\nsubmitted her comments (ATTACHMENT E). She spoke of the exclusion of the\nliving space from the FAR for residential units that are not accessory units\nwould apply to new and existing construction. The special permit process is\nnot the place to rezone basement space throughout the city. There should be a\nuniform way to decide this in zoning. This amendment is right for the Master\nPlanning process or the amendment should begin the process again.\n\nPebble Gifford 15 Hilliard Street, stated that she has an accessory apartment\nthat was grandfathered. She stated that there are problems with this petition.\nShe suggested that each zoning district should be reviewed as to how this\nwould work. She stated that it is ill advised to rezone the entire City with a\nbroad brush as this proposal does. She was involved in drafting the original\naccessory apartment ordinance in 1970. No changes could be made to the\nenvelope of the building. Parking was a requirement and had to be owner\noccupied house and provide some income to fix the house. This has worked in a\nlimited way. She stated that you need a separate means of egress which is\nexpensive. She suggested looking at this in a district by district way and not\ncity-wide. Low income housing should be addressed in the Master Plan. She\nstated that groups cannot be discriminated against such as a group of students\nliving in these units.\n\nAmy Munsat, 71 Standish Street, stated that she is an architectural designer.\nShe stated that for over 25 years she has seen situations where people are\nstruggling to stay in their homes. There is an existing housing stock and this\nis a way to allow flexibility to redesign their spaces that fits them at where\nthey are in their lives. This addresses numerous issues including aging in\nplace, addresses sustainability and livable space and adds income to families.\nShe stated that so many people could take advantage of this.\n\nJan Devereux, 255 Lakeview Avenue, signed the petition last summer and agreed\nwith the flexibility intent to owners to the existing housing stock. She\nstated that some of the amendments are acceptable. She stated that the\nadditional 623 units is a limited impact because of the burden to create the\nseparate egress and having the capital to do this. Only half of this number\nmay actually benefit which is a small number of units. She added that the\ncurrent accessory housing ordinance does not require that it be owner\noccupied.\n\nJames Williamson 1000 Jackson Place, spoke about flooding which is a\nsignificant issue. He suggested taking a look at where flooding would be a\nproblem. Height may be an issue, unit size, livability and minimum square\nfootage. He likes the theory of low and moderate income people being able to\ndo something to remain in their homes. Protecting the affordability of the\nunits is a conundrum. Neighborhood density and parking are issues. He stated\nthat there are complexities with this. He agreed with the Planning Board on\nthis.\n\nAt this time Councillor Carlone assumed the chair.\n\nStephen Kaiser, 191 Hamilton, a homeowner of a three decker since 1972. The\ndiscussion is for one or two family houses. He stated that if he paints his\nhouse he can have low rents. His primary concerns are flooding and basements.\nHe stated that no study has been done by the proponent about the flood levels\nand storms. He agreed with the Planning Board recommendation. He stated that\nin July 2010 there was 4 inches of rain in 70 minutes. As a result the Public\nWorks building and the Somerville Fire station were flooded. This is a\npractical concern and it is not addressed in the petition. He is more in\nopposition. He spoke about destabilization of neighborhoods. If this were\npassed it would result in high cost renovations and it would lead to high\nrents and Cambridge cannot lose low and moderate income housing. He stated\nthat the proposal needs further study. He urged the City Council not to pass\nthe proposal. He submitted his comments (ATTACHMENT F).\n\nWayne Bingham, Cedar Street, stated that there is construction on each side of\nhis house and the children are being woken up at 7 AM. He asked why there must\nbe development taking place on every square inch of land in Cambridge. He\nasked is the City pro-developer or pro-neighborhood. He stated that the\nneighborhoods are gone.\n\nTony Madan stated that this is a way to get affordable housing. He spoke about\nthe rents charged for a basement apartment compared to a sunny upper floor\napartment. This will be an incentive for landlords being property up to code.\n\nPublic comment closed at 3:27 PM on motion of Councillor Carlone.\n\nVice Mayor Benzan assumed the Chair and asked the pleasure of the City\nCouncil.\n\nCouncillor McGovern spoke about historical concerns and flooding issues will\nthere be a process to approve what gets built. Mr. Barrett stated that this is\nto align the Building, Sanitary and Municipal Codes. All approvals will be\nneeded in order to build. He stated single and two family houses can be\nrenovated at 6'11\" without a special permit. He stated that you want ISD\ninspectors to look at these units. He stated that some properties are not\nallowed to do this. He stated that basements could be renovated but not be\naccessory space. Councillor McGovern stated that height and density are\nissues. This is a way to create affordable units and a way to let family\nmembers, seniors and students stay in their homes. People who want to live\nclose to their work want to live in the City. He wanted assurance that these\nunits would be low income units. Mr. Barrett states that there is no owner\noccupied required in the accessory apartment. He stated that if you want to\ncreate accessory units for low income residents you can, but it is not his\nintention. He wants to create flexibility and more housing for everyone, not\njust affordable housing.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that the thrust of proposal makes sense. He\nsuggested above garages as added living space. Scandinavian countries build in\nthe attic and add elevators especially for the elderly. He stated that this\nwould make sense in some instances and not in others. He spoke about using a\nFrench drain for moisture in basements. He stated that renovations needed\ncould be expensive and this is where the rents may be effected. The premise\nmakes sense. The Planning Board recommendation that this be part of the Master\nPlan makes sense and getting it right makes sense.\n\nMayor Maher stated the petition shows the creativity for housing and access to\nhousing. He stated that basement overlay district was done last term along\nMass. Avenue from the Cambridge Common to Porter Square. We are seeing what\ncan be done in these apartments. Mr. Roberts outlined the projects that are\nongoing. Mayor Maher stated that there is a provision about the flood zone\nthat the Public Works Commissioner has to sign off if the units are in a flood\nzone. This has merit and he is grateful that this was brought forward. There\nis an opportunity to continue to look at this and have adapted the\nrecommendation. Mr. Barrett stated that PART A and B are different. The\naccessory apartment part could be brought into the Master Plan process but the\nPart B does not need study by the Master Plan. He is talking about freedom and\nflexibility to use space in a safe, legal way.\n\nVice Mayor Benzan commended Mr. Barrett. How do we prevent a sell-off of\nsingle and two family homes? Mr. Barrett stated that the inclusion of two\nfamily structures complicates this proposal and he included two family units\nto create units. Mr. Barrett stated that in his original proposal he included\nownership affidavit. The current ordinance does not require any chain of\nownership.\n\nCouncillor Toomey moved that the matter be referred to the full City Council\nwithout recommendation. The motion carried on a voice vote of five members.\n\nThe following e-mail was received and made part of the report:\n\nCommunication from Carole Perrault stated that the petition is not ready for\nprime time and its impact on historical and architectural character of\nneighborhoods needs to be thoroughly understood (ATTACHMENT G).\n\nVice Mayor Benzan thanked all those present for their attendance.\n\nThe hearing adjourned at 3:52 PM.\n\nFor the Committee,\n\n__________________________________\n\nCouncillor Dennis J. Carlone, Co-Chair\n\nVice Mayor Dennis A. Benzan, Co-Chair\n\nOrdinance Committee\n\n"
