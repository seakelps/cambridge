WHEREAS: It has come to the attention of the City Council that the Joint Committee on Housing recently held a hearing on H.1426/S.890, the Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act (TOPA), a policy that the City Council [has previously](https://cambridgema.iqm2.com/Citizens/Detail_LegiFile.aspx?ID=13826) supported; and ---|--- WHEREAS: TOPA would give cities and towns the local option of providing tenants in multi-family buildings the right to match a third-party offer when their homes are sold, including through partnering with an affordable housing purchaser or by designating their rights to a non-profit or local housing authority; and WHEREAS: H.1426/S.890 is based on similar legislation from around the country, including a Washington DC ordinance enacted in 1980 which [has helped](https://shelterforce.org/2020/07/24/giving-tenants-the-first- opportunity-to-purchase-their-homes/) to permanently preserve the affordability of thousands of homes at just a fraction of the cost of constructing new affordable units; and WHEREAS: Cambridge has desperately needed tools to protect renters from displacement ever since a small group of landlords led a successful effort to ban rent control statewide in 1994 via ballot referendum, despite the policy\u2019s immense local popularity, effectively handcuffing the council\u2019s ability to regulate the landlord-tenant relationship in any way; and WHEREAS: Housing stabilization is a public health issue, and displacement and unaffordable rents disproportionately impact people of color, seniors, people with disabilities, unhoused people, LGBTQ+ people, and other vulnerable groups; and WHEREAS: The pandemic is causing increasing distress in the housing market and is expected to result in more turmoil, speculative purchases and resident displacement; and WHEREAS: This policy was advanced by both chambers of the legislature in the previous session as part of the Economic Development omnibus bill, only to be vetoed by Governor Baker after the close of the session; now therefore be it RESOLVED: That the City Council go on record in reaffirming strong support for H.1426/S.890, the Tenant Opportunity to Purchase Act; and be it further RESOLVED: That the City Council go on record urging the Joint Committee on Housing to advance the bill out of committee as soon as possible, and in urging the Legislature to put this bill back on the Governor\u2019s desk as soon as possible; and be it further RESOLVED: That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward suitably engrossed copies of this resolution to Cambridge\u2019s Legislative Delegation, the chairs of the Joint Committee on Housing, and Governor Charles Baker on behalf of the entire City Council.",

DePasquale, City Manager, relative to Awaiting Report Item Number 21-33, regarding Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment standards in the review of development projects. In response to Awaiting Report Item Number 21-33, regarding Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment standards in the review of development projects, Assistant City Manager for Community Development Iram Farooq and Traffic, Parking & Transportation Director Joseph Barr report the following: Since receiving Policy Order O-3 of May 3, 2021, staff in the Community Development Department (CDD) and Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department (TP+T) have begun recommending EVSE-installed and EVSE-ready parking facilities as part of developments seeking a Project Review Special Permit from the Planning Board. This process has involved working with developers early in the design process so that they understand the City\u2019s expectations and the staff role in recommending conditions for the Planning Board to incorporate into its approval of special permits. In the months since receiving the Policy Order, most of the proposals seeking Project Review Special Permits have not included the construction of new parking facilities. The one Planning Board case that has included new parking facilities was the MIT Volpe Exchange Parcel Planned Unit Development (case PB-368 <https://www.cambridgema.gov/specialpermits/pb368>), which includes two large new below-grade parking garages. As a condition of the PUD special permit granted in July, MIT significantly increased the EVSE spaces originally proposed and committed to design all of its parking facilities to be EVSE- ready and to initially equip 10% of spaces with EVSE chargers, and to monitor demand annually in order to increase the number of EVSE chargers so that future EV users would be accommodated as demand increases. Staff will continue to work with applicants and the Planning Board to incorporate EVSE standards into new parking facilities for future projects.",

Wade upholds the constitutional right to privacy, including in health care decisions and the right to access abortion care; and WHEREAS: The rights established in Roe v. Wade have been relied upon in this country for nearly 50 years with nearly 7 in 10 Americans agree with the decision that established a woman\u2019s right to an abortion; and WHEREAS: In 2020, the ROE Act was passed into law in the Commonwealth, abolishing unnecessary abortion restrictions and codifying the principles of reproductive freedom in Massachusetts state law; and WHEREAS: Over the last decade reproductive rights and freedom have been under attack across the nation and since 2011, anti-abortion lawmakers throughout the country have pushed nearly 500 restrictive laws through state legislatures to make abortion difficult and at times completely impossible to access; and WHEREAS: These abortion bans and restrictions have become more extreme and have aimed to restrict abortion as early as 6 and 8 weeks of pregnancy\u2014before many people even know they are pregnant; and WHEREAS: Abortion bans do not stop abortion, they merely push safe, necessary care out of reach of the most vulnerable and disproportionately impact Black, Indigenous, and People of Color and those struggling to make ends meet; and WHEREAS: On September 1, 2021 the Supreme Court denied an emergency request to block Texas S.B. 8, a blatantly unconstitutional and radical six-week abortion ban that also incentivizes vigilantism and provides a $10,000 reward for private citizens who sue their neighbors on suspicion of abetting abortion; and WHEREAS: The Texas SB 8 bill will not be the last attack on reproductive freedom; this fall, the Supreme Court is scheduled to consider another case from Mississippi that takes direct aim at the core protections of Roe v. Wade; and WHEREAS: It is clear that the ultraconservative majority on the Supreme Court is not interested in defending abortion rights and access from these constant attacks and has now helped to advance the agenda to end access to safe abortion; and WHEREAS: Congress can and must act to pass legislation that affirms reproductive rights, freedom and justice and codifies protections in Roe v. Wade in federal law once and for all; and WHEREAS: The Women\u2019s Health Protection Act, co-introduced by Massachusetts\u2019s own Representative Ayanna Pressley along with Representative Judy Chu is the legislative solution that would fight back against these ultraconservative attacks on abortion access and codify the right for doctors to provide and patients to access abortion care free from medically unnecessary bans and restrictions; and WHEREAS: Each day that goes by without Congressional action means that more people\u2014disproportionately Black, Indigenous, and People of Color, members of the LGBTQIA+ community and those struggling to make ends meet-- will be denied their constitutional right to abortion; now therefore be it RESOLVED: That the City Council go on record in support of Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley\u2019s Women\u2019s Health Protection Act as the legislative solution to fight back against the calculated attacks on reproductive rights and freedom across the country; and be it further RESOLVED: That the City Council urges President Biden to swiftly sign the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act into law and continue to use the full power of the Presidency to affirm reproductive rights and justice for all; and be it further RESOLVED: That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a copy of this resolution to the Cambridge delegation and President Biden on behalf of the entire City Council.",

      "full_text": "A communication transmitted from Louis A. DePasquale, City Manager, relative to the recommendations of the Community Preservation Act Committee (CPAC) for FY2022. Listed below are the recommendations of the Community Preservation Act Committee (CPAC) for FY2022. For additional information, please see attachments from the CPA Committee Chair, David Kale, dated September 15, 2021. The CPA process included a virtual public hearing held on June 12, 2021 to solicit proposals and ideas on CPA projects for FY2022. A second virtual public hearing was held on July 14, 2021 to solicit recommendations on the percentage of CPA funds allocated to each funding category: Affordable Housing, Historic Preservation, and Open Space. The CPAC also received several online submissions and emailed comments regarding potential CPA projects and the allocation percentages. The CPAC, on September 14, 2021, voted unanimously for an allocation of 80% for Affordable Housing, 10% for Historic Preservation projects and 10% for Open Space projects. In accordance with the CPAC\u2019s recommendations, I am requesting that the City Council appropriate a total of $17,510,000 in CPA funds raised by the City's FY2022 CPA surcharge, the FY2021 state match funds received in FY2022 and a portion of the existing CPA Fund Balance. For this appropriation, it is estimated that the net local receipts from the CPA surcharge for FY2022 will total $11,200,000, added to an anticipated FY2021 state match of $4,200,000 and an additional $2,110,000 from CPA Fund Balance. Additionally, $10,000 from CPA Fund Balance will go to the City\u2019s annual membership in the Community Preservation Coalition. On September 14, 2021 the CPAC made recommendations for allocation of these FY2022 funds. The CPAC recommended to the City Council, through the City Manager, that the CPA funds be allocated and appropriated as follows: VOTE 1: Fiscal Year 2022 Local Funds ($11,200,000) Vote 1A 80% of FY2022 CPA Local Fund revenues ($8,960,000) allocated to Affordable Housing and appropriated to the Cambridge Affordable Housing Trust Vote 1B 10% of FY2022 CPA Local Fund revenues ($1,120,000) allocated to Historic Preservation as follows: 1. $520,000 appropriated to the Lombardi Municipal Building, Roof Replacement 2. $600,000 appropriated to the Historic Preservation Grants Vote 1C 10% of FY2022 CPA Local Fund revenues ($1,120,000) allocated to Open Space as follows: 1. $40,000 appropriated to the Alewife Restoration 2. $5,000 appropriated to the Bare Root Nursery Expansion, Fresh Pond 3. $1,075,000 appropriated to the Raymond Street (Corcoran) Park, Design & Partial Construction VOTE 2: Fiscal Year 2021 State Funds [received in FY2022] ($4,200,000) Vote 2A 80% of FY2021 State Match revenues ($3,360,000) allocated to Affordable Housing and appropriated to the Cambridge Affordable Housing Trust Vote 2B 10% of FY2021 State Match revenues ($420,000) allocated to Historic Preservation as follows: 1. $67,000 appropriated to the Architectural Survey Digitization, Phase IV 2. $173,000 appropriated to the City Record Digitization 3. $165,000 appropriated to the Flagstaff Park Flagpole Restoration 4. $15,000 appropriated to the Lombardi Municipal Building, Roof Replacement Vote 2C 10% of FY2021 State Match revenues ($420,000) allocated to Open Space as follows: 1. $120,000 appropriated to the Bare Root Nursery Expansion, Fresh Pond 2. $150,000 appropriated to the Magazine Beach, Sunken Parking Lot Removal & Grassy Beach Creation 3. $150,000 appropriated to the Rafferty Park, Design VOTE 3: CPA Fund Balance ($2,100,000) Vote 3A 80% of the Fund Balance ($1,680,000) allocated to Affordable Housing and appropriated to the Cambridge Affordable Housing Trust Vote 3B 10% of the Fund Balance ($210,000) allocated to Historic Preservation as follows: 1. $10,000 appropriated to the Flagstaff Park Flagpole Restoration 2. $200,000 appropriated to the Winthrop Wall Restoration, Construction.

I am hereby requesting an appropriation of $199,736.56 received from the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) Shared Streets and Spaces Program Grant, to the Grant Fund Traffic, Parking, and Transportation Extraordinary Expenditures account.

DePasquale, City Manager, relative to a request for approval to submit an amendment to the proposed Home Rule Petition for a special law regarding a fire cadet program for the City of Cambridge Fire Department. I am writing to request your approval to submit the attached amendment to the proposed Home Rule Petition for a special law regarding a fire cadet program for the City of Cambridge Fire Department. As background, on February 22, 2021, the City Council approved Council Order No. 6 confirming that it favored the filing of a Petition for a Special Law Regarding a Fire Cadet Program for the City of Cambridge Fire Department (\u201cFire Cadet Legislation\u201d) in a similar manner to the act which authorizes City of Cambridge police cadets, Chapter 679 of the Acts of 1979 (\u201cPolice Cadet Legislation\u201d). The Police Cadet Legislation was enacted in the aftermath of a 1979 case called Castro v. Beecher, in which approximately 90 municipalities in the Commonwealth were subject to federal civil rights litigation involving their practices in hiring police officers, and which required specific groupings of police candidates at the time. Based upon the order in that case, the Police Cadet Legislation included language stating that if \u201cany federal or state, administrative or court order requires the listing of candidates in separate groups, each group to be listed according to the laws of the commonwealth, then this act shall be subject to such listing.\u201d Chapter 679 of the Acts of 1979, at Section 2. The proposed Fire Cadet Legislation, attached to Council Order No. 6 of 2/22/2021, included similar language in Section 4 of such proposed legislation since it was modeled after the Police Cadet Legislation. However, because the compelled groupings which related to the court order in Castro v. Beecher are no longer applicable, and because it is implied that the City would have to follow such inapplicable court order, inclusion of Section 4 in the proposed Fire Cadet Legislation is superfluous and could create confusion. These changes do not substantively affect the proposed Legislation. I am therefore requesting your approval to remove Section 4 from the proposed Fire Cadet Legislation. I have attached a tracked changes version of the proposed amended Fire Cadet Legislation, as well as a clean copy for your review and consideration.",

Rossi, and the efforts yielded the opinion from the Community Development Department and the City Solicitor that, while creating housing for the exclusive habitation of members of the LGBTQ+ Community might violate federal fair-housing laws, an alternative concept worth considering would be to create LGBTQ+-Friendly housing that would be marketed to this population, and that would create a welcoming and inviting atmosphere for this community; and WHEREAS: While work on this endeavor has proven to be frustratingly slow, and efforts to create such housing have thus far yielded no tangible plans in Cambridge, the need and rationale for such housing remains, and it would therefore be prudent to explore how the City might yet bring this concept to fruition; now therefore be it ORDERED: That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct the Community Development Department, the City Solicitor, and other appropriate City staff to compile a report detailing the efforts the City has made toward creating LGBTQ+-Friendly Housing over the past decade, to state what impediments had been identified in realizing this effort, and to outline recommendations for how the City may successfully create such housing within the next three years; and be it further ORDERED: That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct the appropriate City staff to include a new section on the City\u2019s housing website to serve as a repository for this report and all future information pertinent to this endeavor, so that future City Councils can easily retrace the steps already taken in this process and more easily build upon the work that has already been done; and be it further ORDERED: That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to appoint an LGBTQ+-Friendly Housing Task Force charged with establishing a plan to create such housing and advancing this work in 2022 and beyond; and be it further ORDERED: That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on this matter by the end of this calendar year.",

Minimum Mandatory Conditions. In addition to any other conditions that may be required in connection with the issuance of building permits, each building permit issued in connection with the construction, reconstruction, installation, demolition, maintenance or repair of any commercial building estimated to cost not less than $1,000,000 or in connection with a residential building with 4 or more units shall be subject to and shall include the following set of mandatory permit conditions: \u201cIt shall be a material condition of this Permit that any construction manager, general contractor or other lead or prime contractor, or any entity functioning in any such capacity, and any other contractor or subcontractor of any tier or other person or entity that is engaged to perform the construction work on the property that is the subject of this Permit (hereinafter, collectively and individually, the \u201ccontractor\u201d) shall comply with the following qualifications and conditions at all times during their performance of work on the project: 1. The contractor has not been debarred or suspended from performing construction work by any federal, state or local government agency or authority in the past five years; 2.

The contractor must maintain appropriate industrial accident insurance sufficient to provide coverage for all the employees on the project in accordance with G.L. c.152 and provide documentary proof of such coverage to the Inspectional Services Department to be maintained as a public record; 4. The contractor must properly classify employees as employees rather than independent contractors and treat them accordingly for purposes of minimum wages and overtime, workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage, unemployment taxes, social security taxes and state and federal income tax withholding, in accordance with G.L. c.149, \u00a7148B on employee classification and any other relevant statutes, laws and ordinances; 5. The contractor must comply with G.L. c. 151, \u00a71A and G.L. c. 149, \u00a7 148 and any other relevant statutes, laws and ordinances with respect to the payment of wages; and 6. The contractor must be in compliance with the health and hospitalization requirements of the Massachusetts Health Care Reform law established by Chapter 58 of the Acts of 2006, as amended, and regulations promulgated under that statute by the Commonwealth Health Insurance Connector Authority.

Appeals. Any person aggrieved by a stop work order issued by the City Manager or designee shall have the appeal rights set forth in Section 8.60.070 - Appeals of fines. 2.66.100 WAGE THEFT 2.66.110 \u2013 Purpose The purpose of this chapter is to reinforce existing laws against wage theft in the City of Cambridge, and expand on them to provide the city\u2019s workers with stronger and more easily enforceable wage and benefits protections. 2.66.120 \u2013 Powers Regarding Wage Theft (a) The city, by and through its officials, boards and commissions, may deny an application for any license or permit issued by it, if, during the three- year period prior to the date of the application, the applicant admitted guilt or liability or has been found guilty, liable or responsible, in any judicial or administrative proceeding, of committing or attempting to commit a violation of: 1) Commonwealth of Massachusetts Payment of Wages Law, General Laws Chapter 149, Section 148, and any and all other state or federal laws regulating the payment of wages, including, but not limited to, Chapter 149, Sections 27, 27G, 27H, 52D, 148A, 148B, 150C, 152, 152A, 159C; and Chapter 151, sections 1, 1A, 1B, 15, 19 and 20 of the General Laws; and 2) The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a71692, or any other federal or state law regulating the collection of debt, as to the employees of the applicant or others who had performed work for said applicant.

      "full_text": "A communication transmitted from Louis A. DePasquale, City Manager, relative to authorization to grant street obstruction approvals. In June 2020 and again in November 2020, I requested and received the City Council\u2019s authorization to grant street obstruction approvals, which are required for restaurants to operate outdoor dining on the sidewalk or street, until sixty (60) days past the end of the state of emergency declared by the Governor of Massachusetts due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. I sought this authorization in order to respond to the restaurant community\u2019s need to expand outdoor dining services in response to the COVID-19 Pandemic, and consistent with Governor Baker\u2019s COVID-19 Orders which authorized restaurants to expand outdoor dining through an expedited process until sixty (60) days past the end of the state of emergency. On May 28, 2021, Governor Baker issued COVID-19 Order No. 69 which among other things ordered that the statewide Declaration of a State of Emergency terminated as of June 15, 2021. Accordingly, my authority to grant street obstruction approvals would expire August 14, 2021, except that because the City Council has granted the City Manager ongoing authority during the summer months when the Council does not meet regularly, my authority would expire on September 13, 2021. On June 16, 2021, Governor Baker signed into law an Act Relative to Extending Certain COVID-19 Measures Adopted During the State of Emergency, and that Act extends the ability to approve an expansion of premises for outdoor dining through April 1, 2022, without having to undergo the full licensing process and notice requirements, and such outdoor dining does not have to comply with the zoning act, G.L. c.40A. In light of the Act\u2019s extension of the expedited outdoor dining process the City has extended its temporary street and sidewalk patio license agreements until January 1, 2022. City staff has also been reviewing the City\u2019s normal outdoor dining process to find ways to improve the process to assist restaurants when the City\u2019s normal outdoor dining season resumes on March 1, 2022. Therefore, because the Act allows for the expedited outdoor dining process through April 1, 2022, and to allow the City to continue to respond to the restaurant community\u2019s need for outdoor dining in an expeditious manner, including in the spring as restaurants resume outdoor dining pursuant to the City\u2019s normal outdoor dining process, I am hereby requesting that the City Council extend its prior authorization for me or my designee to grant all approvals for street temporary obstructions, until June 30, 2022.",

WHEREAS: For generations, cities across the country have grappled with how to adequately redress the historic injustices carried out against Black and Brown people throughout our country\u2019s history, and the negative impacts that continue to ripple across our society due to the harmful, shameful institution of slavery; and ---|--- WHEREAS: Our country\u2019s original sin was set in motion in 1619 when the first individuals were forcibly taken from Africa and forced into slave labor in Point Comfort, Virginia, and this unconscionable practice would be allowed to fester and grow for more than two centuries before President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 (and even then, slavery was not fully abolished across the country [until the Civil War formally ended](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth) in 1865); and WHEREAS: As noted by the [Evanston, IL City Council](https://www.cityofevanston.org/home/showpublisheddocument/62670/637511529208270000) in 2002, \u201c\u2026uncompensated slave labor was the primary [labor] source throughout the colonies\u2026for clearing and cultivating land, planting and harvesting crops, and providing artisanal products\u201d and that \u201c\u202635 million African Americans currently in the United States are direct descendants of slaves brought to the New World beginning 400 years ago;\u201d and WHEREAS: In 2019, the Evanston City Council laid the groundwork for a first of-its-kind initiative designed to provide reparations to the descendants of those who were enslaved in this country, utilizing tax revenues from the burgeoning marijuana industry in Illinois to fund grants of $25,000 to 16 eligible Black residents to be put towards homeownership and generational equity-building; and WHEREAS: As the national debate over the concept of reparations continues to be held, programs like the one being piloted in Evanston, IL may point the way toward a viable means of municipalities beginning to address the unconscionable wrongs perpetrated by this country centuries ago, and which continue to negatively impact millions of people today, with the understanding that the federal government must ultimately play a much larger role in addressing these wrongs; and WHEREAS: As the Evanston Model is not the only model worthy of consideration, the City of Cambridge could emulate that program\u2019s spirit with an initiative that takes some of the revenues from local cannabis sales and distributes these funds among, and to lift up, local Black-owned businesses, with the hope that this could be expanded if found to be successful and with the understanding that there may be additional, concurrent reparations programs piloted in our city; now therefore be it ORDERED: That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct the appropriate City staff to determine the feasibility of establishing a pilot reparations program that would take a to-be-determined percentage of revenue from local cannabis sales and distribute these monies to local Black-owned businesses, with a targeted launch date of July 2022; and be it further ORDERED: That the City Manager be and hereby is also requested to direct the appropriate City staff to determine the feasibility of establishing reparations programs with funding from other appropriate sources for possible future implementation to redress policies, including those enforced in Cambridge, that prohibited descendants of enslaved people from acquiring wealth, thereby contributing to the unconscionable median net worth of $8 for Boston area American born Blacks compared to $247,000 for white families; and be it further ORDERED: That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on any progress made toward this endeavor by October 4, 2021.",

      "full_text": "A communication transmitted from Louis A. DePasquale, City Manager, relative to Awaiting Report Item Number 21-41, regarding a report on closing Mass Ave from Prospect Street to Sidney Street on Friday and Saturday evenings. CHARTER RIGHT EXERCISED BY COUNCILLOR MCGOVERN IN COUNCIL JUNE 28, 2021 TABLE IN COUNCIL AUGUST 2, 2021 In response to Awaiting Report 21-41, which requesting that the City Manager work with all relevant City departments, the Central Square BID, and the MBTA to close Massachusetts Avenue from Prospect Street to Sidney Street on Friday and Saturday evenings from 7:00pm to 1:00am through September 2021, please be advised of the following: Representatives from multiple departments met to discuss this potential closure, including the City Manager\u2019s Office, the Fire Department, the Police Department, the City Solicitor\u2019s Office, the Traffic, Parking, + Transportation Department, the Community Development Department, the Department of Public Works, and the License Commission. Representatives from the public safety departments (Fire and Police) expressed significant concerns about a full closure of this segment of Massachusetts Avenue, including the following specific issues: \u00b7 This segment of Massachusetts Avenue is a major response route for the Fire Department in calls for assistance for both fire and emergency medical services. Closing off this section of roadway would present tremendous tactical challenges for the Fire Department to adequately protect the city and respond to calls from the community and is not acceptable from a fire safety perspective. \u00b7 The Engine Six firehouse on River Street is currently closed for repairs. While the Fire Department has adjusted their response plans to properly cover Cambridgeport during this closure, any closure of Massachusetts Avenue could delay the response of units and present an added risk to the community. \u00b7 The rerouting of various trucks and commercial vehicles onto smaller side streets could also place the residents, pedestrians, and bicycles on those streets at additional risk due to the multiple right-angle turns required for that rerouting. It is also important to note that Massachusetts Avenue between Sydney Street and Pleasant Street is part of the hazardous materials truck route that must be used in place of the Prudential tunnel on the Massachusetts Turnpike (I-90), so any closure would move those trucks onto smaller streets and require additional turning movements through the early morning hours. \u00b7 The Police Department expressed significant concerns regarding the recurring staffing required to support such a closure, given the traffic and crowd control that would be required to maintain a safe and organized closure (potentially including the need to deploy blocking trucks or hard barriers). Based on these concerns from public safety agencies, the City Solicitor also expressed concerns regarding any such closure. Staff also consulted with service planning staff from the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), to understand their perspective on this idea. The MBTA is not supportive of this recurring closure, particularly given the number of different bus routes, the volume of customers that travel in this area, and the transfer connections available to the Red Line. Specific concerns include confusion for customers, the staffing and other resources required to plan and implement significant detours on multiple routes, bus stop relocation challenges, and the increased walking distance for transferring customers, particularly those with disabilities. Based on all these concerns, I am not comfortable moving forward with a plan that involves a full closure of Massachusetts Avenue between Sydney Street and Prospect Street on Friday and Saturday evenings, as suggested in the original Policy Order. However, the City remains supportive of implementing more limited street closures, as we have done in other locations around the City in response to COVID-19 and to address other key needs, particularly where these closures help directly support the vitality of local businesses and local neighborhoods. Within Central Square, we would be open to working with the Central Square Business Improvement District (BID) and individual businesses to create additional spaces on side streets for outdoor dining, retail sales, or other supportive uses. In creating these spaces, we also need to be sensitive to the specific needs of these groups and nearby residents and ensure that any changes recognize and respond both to the businesses\u2019 operations as well as the residents\u2019 concerns. Implementation of any street closures would also need to be done in a manner that increases the attractiveness of the area, which typically requires programming and activation. We are currently engaged with the Central Square BID and appropriate City staff to discuss additional opportunities for side street closures that will help support the local businesses, residents and the Cultural District as a whole.",

CHARTER RIGHT EXERCISED BY COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN IN COUNCIL JUNE 21, 2021 I am hereby requesting the appropriation of $65,019,211, received from the U.S. Department of Treasury through the new Coronavirus Local Fiscal Recovery Fund (CLFRF) established by the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), to the Grant Fund Finance Department Other Ordinary Maintenance account. Funds are intended to: \u00b7 Support urgent COVID-19 response efforts to continue to decrease spread of the virus and bring the pandemic under control. \u00b7 Replace lost public sector revenue to strengthen support for vital public services and help retain jobs. \u00b7 Support immediate economic stabilization for households and businesses. \u00b7 Address systematic public health and economic challenges that have contributed to the inequal impact of the pandemic on certain populations. Fiscal staff are currently reviewing the \u201cInterim Final Rule\u201d regulations regarding the funds. Over the next several weeks, this will include working closely with key departments to refine funding priorities and ensure eligibility of projects, as well as reaching out to the State legislative delegation to verify that proposed expenditures through this funding will be approved. It is important to note the CLFRF is a federal grant and the provisions of G.L. c. 44, section 53A apply. Additionally, it is subject to the provisions of the Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost principals, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards (2CRF 200) (the Uniform Guidance). It is the City\u2019s responsibility as the primary recipient to ensure eligible programs respond to the negative impact of COVID-19 and that all expenditures are justified and documented for reporting purposes. It is important to note, that if the City expends funds for a specific project or initiative that is later deemed ineligible for funding through the federal reporting process, the City will be required to fund the entire cost(s) from Free Cash. Therefore, a thorough review of project eligibility is critical before any expenditures through this program are made. Potential eligible projects that will be explored include (but are not limited to): \u00b7 Public health spending. This includes COVID-19 mitigation efforts, medical expenses, behavioral health, and certain public health and safety staff. o Upgrade neighborhood park and playground adjacent to the Kennedy Longfellow School that is intensely used by children associated with the adjacent schools, Human Services programs, and area non-profits. o Time-limited free public transportation access option to improve access to public transportation including subway and bus to address systemic public health and economic challenges through reducing transportation costs and encouraging active transportation. \u00b7 Economic impacts of the public health emergency. These include efforts to mitigate economic harm to workers, households, small businesses, affected industries, and the public sector. o Provide support for job training and other employment services for individuals who need such services to be able to access employment that leads to a living wage and career pathway. o Direct business grants. o Grants for hotel/tourism businesses. o Outdoor dining infrastructure support and grants. o Add to storefront, accessibility for outdoor dining/patios in parking spaces. o Public patios in commercial districts and corridors. o Ecommerce grants - capacity building, tech assistance and implementation of a quick build website. o Grants for energy efficient equipment e.g. refrigerators, induction stoves, other cooking equipment, machines and other appliances, batteries to increase energy resilience, ideally paired with on-site solar. o Grants for business associations events (i.e. October Fest/Inman Eats/Central Flea, etc.). o Grants to expand pop up retail programs. o Grants to Cambridge non-profit organizations to provide enhanced and continued services to residents impacted by the pandemic. o Grants to Cambridge non-profit organizations for operating costs for limited duration (3 or 6 months) to offset pandemic related losses. o Support for the Restaurant Homeless Shelter Meals Program. o Expansion of food delivery to residents of Cambridge housing developments, for healthy food for Cambridge food pantry network, and for expansion of school markets. o Funding to expand Pre-K programs as part of development of Universal Pre-K program. o Provide laptops and other appropriate devices for low income students accessing Community Learning Center classes, for first generation college going students and for low- and moderate-income seniors. o Provide scholarship support to low- and moderate-income students attending out of school time programs. o Provide funding for housing navigation and stabilization services to support permanent supported housing for individuals currently unhoused in Cambridge. o Rent/mortgage support to residents economically impacted by the pandemic beyond the 6-month limit allowed by CDBG, if permissible. o Recapitalize HIP program which supports renovation by low income homeowners - expand focus to weatherization, energy efficiency upgrades (net zero package) and de-leading. o Neighborhood Resilience Hubs in two locations (Alewife/the Port/Riverside) to build and support social resilience. o Cooling sites, ideally coupled with resilience hubs, in Alewife/Port/Riverside. \u00b7 Water, sewer, and broadband infrastructure. Recipients may invest to improve access to clean drinking water, support wastewater and stormwater infrastructure, and expand access to broadband internet. o The Port Infrastructure project which is a significant utility project to reduce flooding, replace water mains and lead services, and reconstruct streets and sidewalks in the Port neighborhood. Project includes a sewer tank and a stormwater tank to reduce flooding in the dense residential neighborhood that is one of the most flood prone neighborhoods in the City. o Wireless Broadband Internet Pilot Program at select Cambridge Housing Authority (CHA) properties as part of the City\u2019s digital equity efforts. o Improving Public WIFI in public squares and adding wifi coverage to city parks. o Upgrading city public facilities (such as libraries and youth centers) with improved HVAC systems and broadband infrastructure. o Municipal and Digital Equity Connectivity projects that will be identified in the 21st Century Broadband RFP. As requested in Policy Order #10 of June 14, 2021, I will work with the Co- Chairs of the Finance Committee to schedule a meeting to further discuss with the City Council, specific projects that are anticipated to be funded through this program. I am requesting the appropriation at this time to provide a mechanism to accept the revenue in order to make timely and necessary expenditures from these funds.",

WHEREAS: For generations, cities across the country have grappled with how to adequately redress the historic injustices carried out against Black and Brown people throughout our country\u2019s history, and the negative impacts that continue to ripple across our society due to the harmful, shameful institution of slavery; and ---|--- WHEREAS: Our country\u2019s original sin was set in motion in 1619 when the first individuals were forcibly taken from Africa and forced into slave labor in Point Comfort, Virginia, and this unconscionable practice would be allowed to fester and grow for more than two centuries before President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863 (and even then, slavery was not fully abolished across the country [until the Civil War formally ended](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth) in 1865); and WHEREAS: As noted by the [Evanston, IL City Council](https://www.cityofevanston.org/home/showpublisheddocument/62670/637511529208270000) in 2002, \u201c\u2026uncompensated slave labor was the primary [labor] source throughout the colonies\u2026for clearing and cultivating land, planting and harvesting crops, and providing artisanal products\u201d and that \u201c\u202635 million African Americans currently in the United States are direct descendants of slaves brought to the New World beginning 400 years ago;\u201d and WHEREAS: In 2019, the Evanston City Council laid the groundwork for a first of-its-kind initiative designed to provide reparations to the descendants of those who were enslaved in this country, utilizing tax revenues from the burgeoning marijuana industry in Illinois to fund grants of $25,000 to 16 eligible Black residents to be put towards homeownership and generational equity-building; and WHEREAS: As the national debate over the concept of reparations continues to be held, programs like the one being piloted in Evanston, IL may point the way toward a viable means of municipalities beginning to address the unconscionable wrongs perpetrated by this country centuries ago, and which continue to negatively impact millions of people today, with the understanding that the federal government must ultimately play a much larger role in addressing these wrongs; and WHEREAS: As the Evanston Model is not the only model worthy of consideration, the City of Cambridge could emulate that program\u2019s spirit with an initiative that takes some of the revenues from local cannabis sales and distributes these funds among, and to lift up, local Black-owned businesses, with the hope that this could be expanded if found to be successful and with the understanding that there may be additional, concurrent reparations programs piloted in our city; now therefore be it ORDERED: That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to direct the appropriate City staff to determine the feasibility of establishing a pilot reparations program that would take a to-be-determined percentage of revenue from local cannabis sales and distribute these monies to local Black-owned businesses, with a targeted launch date of July 2022; and be it further ORDERED: That the City Manager be and hereby is also requested to direct the appropriate City staff to determine the feasibility of establishing reparations programs with funding from other appropriate sources for possible future implementation to redress policies, including those enforced in Cambridge, that prohibited descendants of enslaved people from acquiring wealth, thereby contributing to the unconscionable median net worth of $8 for Boston area American born Blacks compared to $247,000 for white families; and be it further ORDERED: That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to report back to the City Council on any progress made toward this endeavor by October 4, 2021.",

(e) The Cambridge TPTD and Cambridge Police Department shall approve a final Operations and Logistics Plan prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy for a Cannabis Use, and may require operational practices to prevent or correct adverse impacts of the operation of the Cannabis Use on the public way, including but not limited to crowding on the public sidewalk, blocking of travel lanes by vehicles, or hazardous conditions. Such practices may include, but are not limited to, restrictions on the use of the public way, required pre-purchase and/or appointment-only customer service for a period of time, restrictions on the location and/or timing of loading/unloading activities, or similar measures. When granting a special permit, where applicable, the Planning Board may also include conditions pertaining to the Operations and Logistics Plan. 11.805 Application Requirements.

(b) Context Map: A map identifying, at a minimum, the location of the proposed establishment, the locations of all other Cannabis Uses in the vicinity, the locations of all public or private schools providing education in kindergarten or any of grades one through 12, and the locations of all children's playgrounds, youth athletic fields, or other youth recreation facilities, with measured distances provided to demonstrate whether the location complies with the standards of Section 11.803 above. (c) Site Plan: A plan or plans depicting all existing and proposed development on the property, including the dimensions of the building, the detailed layout of automobile and bicycle parking, the location of pedestrian, bicycle and vehicular points of access and egress, the location and design of all loading, refuse and service facilities, the location, type and direction of all outdoor lighting on the site, and any landscape design. (d) Building Elevations and Signage: Architectural drawings of all exterior building facades and all proposed signage, specifying materials and colors to be used. Perspective drawings and illustrations of the site from public ways and abutting properties are recommended but not required. (e) Initial Operations and Logistics Plan: Containing the information set forth in Paragraph (d) of Section 11.804 above. (f) License or Registration Materials: Copies of all materials submitted to applicable state and local agencies for the purpose of licensing and/or registration, and any certification or license issued by any such agency, excluding any information required by law to be kept confidential. 11.806 Special Permit Criteria. In granting a special permit for a Cannabis Use, in addition to the general criteria for issuance of a special permit as set forth in Section 10.43 of this Zoning Ordinance, the Planning Board shall find that the following criteria are met: (a) The site is designed such that it provides convenient, safe and secure access and egress for customers and employees arriving to and leaving from the site using all modes of transportation, including drivers, pedestrians, bicyclists and public transportation users. (b) On-site loading, refuse and service areas are designed to be secure and shielded from abutting uses. (c) The building and site have been designed to be compatible with other buildings in the area and to mitigate any negative aesthetic impacts that might result from required security measures and restrictions on visibility into the building's interior and/or from restrictions on direct access by consumers. (d) In retail areas, the location and design of the Cannabis Use will not detract from the sense of activity with opaque, unwelcoming fa\u00e7ades at the ground floor. Cannabis Uses that are delivery-only and not permitted to operate a retail storefront should occupy minimal ground-story frontage along major retail streets and are encouraged to collocate with active uses to preserve a vibrant streetscape. Where interior activities must be screened from public view or where there is no access by customers, such areas should be screened by transparent, publicly accessible active business uses where possible. Opaque fa\u00e7ades should be minimized, and where they are necessary they should include changing public art displays or other measures to provide visual interest to the public. (e) If the proposed Cannabis Retail Store or Cannabis Production Facility is not proposed to include a Medical Marijuana Treatment Center, it will nevertheless provide programs to assist qualifying patients within the city or neighborhood who are registered through the Massachusetts Medical Use of Marijuana Program in obtaining services under that program. Delete Section 11.806, which currently reads as follows: 11.806 Effective Date.

WHEREAS: Massachusetts Avenue is currently the home of the #47 Bus terminal and start stop, but the existing Central Square route must be moved due to the reconfiguration of Carl Barron Plaza; and ---|--- WHEREAS: The MBTA has proposed moving the these stops to Green Street, a decision that would inconvenience many riders, as well as present pedestrian traffic and safety concerns; and WHEREAS: On an average weekday, 40%-50% of riders boarding the #47 Bus at the Mass Ave./Pearl St. stop in Central Square are transferring from the Red Line, the #1 Bus, or the #70 Bus, while 40%-50% of riders getting off at this stop transfer to the Red Line or #1 Bus, and therefore moving this stop to Green Street will take a significant portion of riders further from their transfers; and WHEREAS: Riders would be forced to cross Massachusetts Avenue, which has notoriously busy and dangerous intersections as well as crowded sidewalks, to access the northbound Red Line station and #1 Bus towards Harvard if the stop was moved to Green Street, which would especially put vulnerable passengers, such as seniors or persons with disabilities, at risk; and WHEREAS: The Cambridge Transit Advisory Committee (CTAC) has instead suggested piloting a change where the inbound #47 Bus would continue down Brookline Ave. to Mass. Ave., make a left and then stopping at the current Route 1 stop near Prospect St. (right next to the Red Line access) as its last stop, before turning around to return for outbound service at the main Central Square stop; and WHEREAS: Curb space could be designated on Magazine Street for the #47 Bus\u2019 layover, keeping these buses out of the busier areas on Massachusetts Avenue and Green Street, and within sight of the Carl Barron Plaza supervisor; and WHEREAS: CTAC\u2019s suggestion would enhance bus service for transferring passengers, while improving current MBTA layover and supervision practices at an insignificant additional deadhead routing cost; and WHEREAS: As more residents return to working in person, ensuring that the #47 Bus route runs smoothly, conveniently, and safely is a matter of transit justice; now therefore be it RESOLVED: That the City Council go on record in support of the Cambridge Transit Advisory Committee\u2019s suggested configuration for the #47 Bus; and be it further RESOLVED: That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward suitably engrossed copies of this resolution to the MBTA on behalf of the entire City Council.",

      "full_text": "A communication transmitted from Louis A. DePasquale, City Manager, relative to Awaiting Report Item Number 20-37, regarding renaming the Central Square Library. In response to Awaiting Report Item Number 20-37, regarding renaming the Central Square Library, please find attached a legal opinion from City Solicitor Nancy E. Glowa in which she has opined that under the City\u2019s Plan \u201cE\u201d Charter, the authority to name or rename City buildings, including Library buildings, rests with the City Manager. As City Manager, I have been vested pursuant to the City\u2019s Charter with the responsibility to supervise the administration of the affairs of the City, which includes responsibility for City buildings and therefore, the authority to name City buildings. I am mindful, however, that the naming of buildings is important to a broad number of constituencies within the City, including with respect to Library buildings, the Library Board of Trustees. Prior to the City\u2019s adoption of the Plan \u201cE\u201d Charter, the City enacted the Cambridge Public Library Ordinance in 1880, later amended to be named the Public Library Department Ordinance, Chapter 2.46 of the Municipal Code (the \u201cOrdinance\u201d.) Under that ordinance, the Library Department had responsibility for the care, custody and maintenance of Library buildings; however, its responsibility in that regard was superseded by the City\u2019s adoption of the Charter. Although the responsibility for the library buildings, including the naming thereof, rests with me, I intend to appoint a task force as proposed that will undertake a study process to be followed in looking at the renaming of the Central Square Library and the establishment of a new library collection that centers Black Voices, at the suggestion of Library Director Maria McCauley, in consultation with the Library Board of Trustees. Library recommendation regarding renaming the Central Square Library The Council Order asked that the City Manager consult with the Cambridge Public Library, the Library Board of Trustees, and any other appropriate City personnel to consider formally renaming the Central Square Branch Library in honor of Maria Baldwin and Representative John Lewis, with the building to be known as \u201cThe Maria Baldwin and Rep. John Lewis Library and Center for African American/Black History and Culture\u201d going forward, or to find another suitable location for this dedication. Library Director Maria McCauley, in consultation with the Library Board of Trustees, has recommended the following study process to be employed in considering whether to rename the Central Square Branch Library: that I appoint a task force to study this issue; that the task force create a process for public input, such as conducting a survey and holding community meetings; that the task force meet monthly, or on a designated regular schedule, until a report of recommendations is made to the Library Director and the City Manager. If the recommendation is to find another suitable location, another task force may need to be created in order to further study that. On the naming as a Center for African American/Black History and Culture Director McCauley reports that the Central Square Branch Library has housed a small Black Studies Collection since 1979 and has also held an annual Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day Celebration since 1975 but that it has not (up to this point) been designated in purpose or planning as a Center for African American and Black History and Culture. It has functioned as a centrally located library branch that serves a diverse population, including ESOL students, children in after school programs, and residents in Central Square, including those in nearby affordable housing sites and those without permanent housing. Prior to the issuance of this Council Order, Director McCauley and the Library Department had recommended that the City do a comprehensive building program study in the near future of the Central Square Branch Library, including its purpose and function and building design. It is anticipated that the central nature of the Central Square Branch Library will be studied in future in connection with the proposed comprehensive building program study. Director McCauley has recommended that the task force review the initial plans for a collection that would center Black Voices, would represent the fullest range of Black experiences possible, and would give input into this new collection. Background on the Black Studies Collection \u2022 Since 1979 the Central Square Branch has housed a Black Studies Collection largely focused on academic and research materials. It does not include materials for children. \u00b7 The Black Studies Collection was originally grant funded along with eight other Ethnic Heritage Collections spread across the O\u2019Connell and Central Square Branches. \u00b7 The Ethnic Heritage Collections did not have ongoing funding and over time were phased out. Of the original collections, only the Black Studies Collection remains. \u00b7 The most items ever contained in the Black Studies Collection was 750. As condition, relevance, and usage decreased, the collection shrank. In 2010, there were less than 400 items included. There are currently about 150 items in the collection. The new Black Voices Collection Over the past year, Library staff have been working on initial planning to create a Black Voices collection to refresh the outdated Black Studies collection with a vibrant, living collection. The new Black Voices Collection\u2019s intent will be to: \u00b7 Create a collection that centers Black Voices and represents the fullest range of Black experiences possible. \u00b7 Collect print materials across age ranges with a focus on popular materials, browsable collections, and circulation. \u00b7 Collect a mix of fiction, genre, memoir, biography, and popular non-fiction. Some titles may reside in multiple Library locations \u00b7 Engage the community in both the selection of titles and ongoing promotion of the collection. The Library Department also has a commitment to documenting African American and Black residents in Cambridge as part of its archival and local history work related to the Cambridge Room, which is housed at the Main Library.\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad Suggestions for a task force: Director McCauley has recommended that the task force include one or more Library Assistant Directors, Library Trustees, City Councilors, Black and Brown community leaders, Latinx community leaders, representative(s) of the Central Square BID, student representative(s), including someone from the Family Policy Council, representative(s) of the Port neighborhood, representative(s) of the Cambridgeport neighborhood, representative(s) of the Cambridge Public Library Foundation and representative(s) of the Cambridge Community Foundation. I intend to appoint members to this task force shortly, and to ask them to begin the study work as outlined above. When there is a recommendation on the questions posed, I will report back to the City Council and ask for your support of the proposed renaming of the Central Square Library at that time.",

I am hereby requesting the appropriation of $2,242,100 from Free Cash to the Public Investment Fund School Extraordinary Expenditures account to fund the Cambridgeport School window replacement project. The Cambridgeport School building, located at 89 Elm Street in Cambridge, currently has windows that are forty years old, with worn out balances, springs and operating sash hardware. Cold air leakage frequently overwhelms the heating system, making it difficult to maintain classroom temperatures on cold days. There is much loss of energy due to the age and construction of the existing windows. This project falls under priority category number 5, which is for the replacement, renovation, or modernization of school facility systems, such as roofs, windows, boilers, heating and ventilation systems, to increase energy conservation and decrease energy related costs in a school facility, as determined in the judgment of the Authority. This request is based upon approval from the Massachusetts School Building Authority (MSBA) of the window replacement project estimated budget as part of their Accelerated Repair Program. Once the Project Funding Agreement is executed, the City will submit requests for reimbursement for project costs to the MSBA. The final grant amount will be determined by the MSBA based on a review and audit of all project costs incurred by the City, in accordance with MSBA\u2019s regulations, policies, and guidelines and the Project Funding Agreement. Any balances that may be available after all costs are paid, will be used for other school repair projects.",

I am hereby requesting the appropriation of $500,000 from Free Cash to the Public Investment Fund Library Extraordinary Expenditures account to fund a comprehensive Library Building Program Study and Feasibility Study for the Central Square Branch Library. The Library Building Program study will be used to identify the Central Square Branch\u2019s future programmatic and space needs related to fulfilling the Library\u2019s Strategic Priorities and mission. The study process will include (but is not limited to): community input; a review of relevant library and city documents as well as interviews with library administration, staff, trustees and other stakeholders; consideration of neighborhood demographics and projected growth and future needs; and an analysis of the size of the current building and how it would need to be organized functionally to meet community needs. The Feasibility study will be informed by the results of the Building Program study and explore conceptual designs that would meet the needs determined by the Building Program. Other considerations will include accessibility guidelines; building envelope; available floor area; and HVAC systems and energy efficiency. The Program and Feasibility Studies are estimated to take 12 to 24 months to complete. This work will supplement previously funded projects that are both completed and currently underway at the Central Square Branch Library including: \u00b7 New furniture including seating and tables in the Children\u2019s Room, Lewis Room, and Literacy Center. \u00b7 New shelving and storage in the Literacy Center. \u00b7 New computers and computer tables in the Children\u2019s Room, Literacy Center, and Tech Center Room. \u00b7 A lighting Study. \u00b7 A new water bubbler. \u00b7 Painting and minor drywall repairs. \u00b7 New carpet, replacement of storage units, and refinishing the kitchenette in the Lewis Room. \u00b7 Replacement of exterior signage and new wayfinding and collection signage \u00b7 Refreshing the outdoor public display case.",

I am hereby requesting the appropriation of $267,750 from Free Cash to the Public Investment Fund, Department of Human Services Programs, Extraordinary expenditures account to provide additional funds to implement repairs to the 3 swimming pools located at the War Memorial Pool Facility. The sole bid for the project was higher than the original estimate ($750,000). This additional funding will be used to enter into a contract (including contingency costs) and complete the work associated with the project. In 2019, a study was conducted to determine necessary repairs to the concrete and circulation system at the War Memorial Pool, including design services. The assessment was completed in 2020 and confirmed that the aging pool foundations and circulating systems would be at risk of failure at multiple locations if significant repairs are not made. A full design process has been completed, including construction methods, materials, and drawings, to define the interventions necessary to keep each of the 3 pools operating safely. Working with the School Department, the Department\u2019s Recreation Division determined that the most appropriate and least disruptive time to do the work would be during the summer of 2021 with an expected completion date of early September.",

Supplement to Proposed Retail Zoning Amendments Overview: The proposed zoning amendments, which include definitions of Retail or Consumer Service Establishments in Article 2.000 and amendments to the Table of Use Regulations in Section 4.30, result in the need to amend other sections of the Zoning Ordinance that may contain outdated references to those Definitions or Sections. While any zoning amendment can have unintended outcomes, the changes suggested in this document are intended to maintain consistency within the language of the Zoning Ordinance and minimize potential substantive changes. i.

I am hereby recommending that in accordance with the requirements of the Massachusetts School Building Authority (MSBA), the Cambridge City Council adopt the attached order for the Statement of Interest Form to be submitted to the MSBA no later than June 1, 2021 for the replacement of boilers at the Morse Elementary School, located at 40 Granite Street. The funds are sought to be used for the replacement of the building's boilers. The Granite Street building's boilers are more than twenty-eight years old, have antiquated controls and have had multiple leaks repaired. Given the age and condition of these boilers, they will soon be beyond further repair. Final cost estimates will be determined through a feasibility study if the project is accepted into the MSBA program. The study will include a detailed analysis of the feasibility of the boiler replacements adhering to the City's greenhouse gas emissions reductions strategy. The School Committee of Cambridge, Massachusetts voted to authorize the Superintendent to submit the Statement of Interest Form to the MSBA at an open meeting held on May 18, 2021. The MSBA submission of the Statement of Interest Form, in no way guarantees the acceptance or the approval of an application, the awarding of a grant or any other funding commitment from the MSBA or commits the City/ School District to filing an application for funding with the MSBA.",

      "full_text": "A communication transmitted from Louis A. DePasquale, City Manager, relative to a request the adoption of a statutory small business exemption for personal property accounts equal to or less than $10,000.00 in assessed value and the authorization for an exemption for personal property accounts equal to or less than $20,000.00 in assessed value, by requesting a special act from the Legislature and the Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Based upon a review of the City of Cambridge\u2019s (\u201cCity\u201d) personal property accounts, in April of 2020, I recommended adoption by the City Council of a statutory small business exemption for personal property accounts equal to or less than $10,000.00 in assessed value, which the City Council approved. The $10,000.00 personal property tax exemption has been effective for Fiscal Year 2021, which exempted 1,194 small businesses from receiving a personal property tax bill. At the same time, I also recommended that the City seek authorization for an exemption for personal property accounts equal to or less than $20,000.00 in assessed value, by requesting a special act from the Legislature and the Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. These recommendations were one part of a plan to help small businesses through a combination of programs including small business initiatives, grants, workshops and tax relief, particularly with respect to our effort to assist small businesses that have dealt with, and are continuing to deal with, the ramifications of COVID-19. On April 6, 2020, the City Council accepted my recommendation and ordered that I work with the City Solicitor to draft a home rule petition to authorize the City to provide a personal property tax exemption of up to $20,000.00 of value, which we completed and submitted to the General Court. The General Court approved the proposed home rule petition, and on January 7, 2021, Chapter 282 of the Acts of 2020 (\u201cAct\u201d) passed (attached), which allows the City of Cambridge to permit a $20,000 personal property tax exemption upon acceptance of the Act by the City Council by majority vote. For fiscal year 2020, the City had 2,576 personal property accounts. Of those, 62% had an assessed value of $20,000.00 or less, which represented just 0.54 percent of the overall personal property valuation in the City of $1.679 billion dollars. For the coming fiscal year, we anticipate that over 1,500 small businesses would be exempted from receiving a personal property tax bill if the City adopts the $20,000.00 exemption. Not only will this tax exemption assist small businesses financially and administratively, but it will also relieve the burden upon the City for the collection and accounting of small accounts. I therefore respectfully request that the City Council accept the provisions of this Act so that the City can start the process of permitting the $20,000 personal property tax exemption for the coming fiscal year. Attached is a proposed order that would provide for the City Council to adopt Chapter 282 of the Acts of 2020 to allow the City to establish a personal property tax exemption in the amount of $20,000.00 for the coming fiscal year and going forward.",

      "full_text": "A communication transmitted from Louis A. DePasquale, City Manager, relative to a request to approve the acquisition of land in Lincoln, Massachusetts for the purpose of adding to the City\u2019s watershed lands for water supply protection and conservation purposes. I am writing to request that you approve the acquisition of land in Lincoln, Massachusetts for the purpose of adding to the City\u2019s watershed lands for water supply protection and conservation purposes. The City of Cambridge has the opportunity to purchase from the Lincoln Rural Land Foundation two parcels of land numbered 4 Twin Pond Lane, Assessor\u2019s parcels #180-13-0 and #180-11-0, in the Town of Lincoln (\u201cthe Property\u201d) consisting of 7.79 + acres of undeveloped land for the purposes of protecting the City\u2019s drinking water supply and for land conservation. The Lincoln Rural Land Foundation is in the process of purchasing the property at a discount this month from private owners. The Property is appraised at $1,000,000. The private owners are selling it to the Lincoln Rural Land Foundation for $800,000. The Lincoln Rural Land Foundation would then convey the Property in fee to the City. The $800,000 cost of conveyance from the Lincoln Rural Land Foundation to the City would be broken down as follows. The Lincoln Rural Land Foundation would contribute $200,000, effectively reducing its sale price to $600,000. The Town of Lincoln will contribute $200,000 toward the sale price. The Lincoln Rural Land Foundation will further contribute $200,000 of funds that were privately fundraised for this purpose. The City will pay only $200,000 plus costs and will obtain the fee interest in the Property. However, the City has applied to the State for a grant to cover the cost of the City's full share of this acquisition, being the $200,000 purchase price plus costs. If the City does not receive the grant, I will request an appropriation from the Water Fund. As a condition of the contributions by the private owners, the Lincoln Rural Land Foundation, the Town of Lincoln, and the State grant, the Property must be permanently protected by a conservation restriction as provided by G.L.c.184, \u00a7\u00a731-33. The Cambridge Water Board voted unanimously on May 11, 2021 to recommend that the City purchase the Property for purposes of water supply protection and conservation. A copy of the Water Board\u2019s vote is attached. I recommend that the City Council authorize the City Manager to purchase the Property on behalf of the City of Cambridge for water supply protection and conservation purposes from previously appropriated funds, and to execute any and all necessary documents on behalf of the City to effectuate this purchase in such form and substance as the City Manager determines is necessary or advisable. I further recommend that the City Council vote to diminish the full disposition process pursuant to Cambridge City Code \u00a72.110.010(g) for the disposition of the property interest to be granted by the City through the conservation restriction to the Lincoln Conservation Commission. I recommend that the City Council vote to grant the permanent conservation restriction for the purpose of protecting the Property from development and from other uses that might be detrimental to the City\u2019s water supply and conservation purposes, and vote to authorize the City Manager to execute any and all necessary documents on behalf of the City related to the conservation restriction in such form and substance as the City Manager determines is necessary or advisable.

      "full_text": "A petition was received from Loren Crowe, requesting that the City Council ordain ordinance language relative to the creation and operation of Neighborhood Conservation Districts in the city. REFERRED TO THE ORDINANCE COMMITTEE IN COUNCIL MAY 25, 2021 To the Honorable City Council: The undersigned registered Cambridge voters respectfully request that the City Council ordain the ordinance language set forth below relative to the creation and operation of Neighborhood Conservation Districts in the city. Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Access 21st Century Values for Neighborhood Conservation Districts We invite you to join us in asking the City to improve the way that we create and operate Neighborhood Conservation Districts in Cambridge. Intended to serve the worthy goals of helping communities to preserve historic structures and maintain neighborhoods as they are, Neighborhood Conservation Districts have too often been exploited unfairly as a means by which tiny, unrepresentative groups of residents can exploit our city ordinances to control their neighbors\u2019 choices and housing options. Recently in Cambridge, we have seen small groups of homeowners initiate the process of establishing new Neighborhood Conservation Districts in order to raise their property values, settle interpersonal disputes, and restrict development potential below even that allowed by zoning. None of those purposes matches Cambridge\u2019s values, and yet that behavior is currently enabled by our City ordinances. The current ordinance language was drafted 40 years ago and needs to be updated to reflect modern community values related to diversity, access, equity, representation, and inclusion. The ordinance governing the creation and operation of Neighborhood Conservation Districts currently allows just ten unrepresentative residents to launch a lengthy study of a Conservation District in an area that might be home to thousands of residents and burden their homes with binding rules. A study can be initiated by the appointed members Cambridge Historical Commission without any input or say so from our democratically elected City Council. A study places binding rules on a neighborhood from the Historical Commission that no one in the neighborhood outside of the Historical Commission\u2019s Study Commission has approved of or consented to, and, according to an opinion issued by City Solicitor Nancy Glowa, those rules can remain in place for as many years as the Historical Commission wants to study them. The membership appointed to the Neighborhood Conservation District Commissions in no way reflects the diversity of their neighborhoods with age, race, ethnicity, renter status, or a host of other factors, tending to confer additional power and privilege to the already powerful and privileged. This petition proposes changes to the ordinance governing the creation and operation of Neighborhood Conservation Districts with a view to increasing the democratic legitimacy of our Conservation Districts by empowering the members of the neighborhoods they govern and by introducing essential democratic checks and balances to the process. The main goals of this petition are: \u00b7 Increasing the democratic threshold required to begin a Conservation District Study \u00b7 Ensuring that the goals of Neighborhood Conservation District are balanced with other City goals of diversity, equity, and inclusion in all City neighborhoods and the need to address the housing supply and cost crisis \u00b7 Ensuring that the democratically elected City Council has a voice in starting a new study \u00b7 Ensuring that the Neighborhood Conservation District Commissions and the rules governing Neighborhood Conservation Districts are reflective of the diversity of our neighborhoods \u00b7 Ensuring that no binding rules are imposed on neighborhoods without the consent of the governed We find no fault with the intent behind the original ordinance language, and we believe that it likely represented the best thinking of the times to solve a social problem of importance to the community. However, the world has learned a lot in the past forty years. Everyone in this city has learned a lot. And we believe that the ordinance changes proposed below will help to better accomplish the ordinance\u2019s original goals by modernizing our Neighborhood Conservation Districts in accordance with our modern values and increased understanding of the moral requirement for diversity, access, affordability, equity, representation, and inclusion throughout community life. We respectfully request ordination of the below changes to the language of Chapter 2.78 Article III. Underlined sections represent the petitioners\u2019 proposed new wording and struck through sections represent proposed deletions.

The Historical Commission by majority vote may recommend for designation as a landmark any property within the City being or containing a place, structure, feature or object which it determines to be either (1) importantly associated with one or more historic persons or events, or with the broad architectural, aesthetic, cultural, political, economic or social history of the City or the Commonwealth or (2) historically or architecturally significant (in terms of period, style, method of construction or association with a famous architect or builder) either by itself or in the context of a group of structures; may recommend for designation as a neighborhood conservation district any area within the City containing places and structures which it determines are of importance to the architectural, aesthetic, cultural, political, economic or social history of the City, and which considered together cause such area to constitute a distinctive neighborhood or to have a distinctive character in terms of its exterior features; and may recommend amendments to any designation of landmark or neighborhood conservation district theretofore made. B. Prior to the recommendation of designation or amendment of designation of any landmark or neighborhood conservation district an investigation and report on the historical, architectural and other relevant significance thereof shall be made. The report shall recommend the boundaries of any proposed landmark or neighborhood conservation district and shall recommend for incorporation in the order of the City Council designating each landmark or neighborhood conservation district general and/or specific standards and appropriate criteria consistent with the purposes of this article and the provisions of Section 2.78.190 of this article that are to be applied in making any determination of the type referred to in Sections 2.78.170, 2.78.210 and 2.78.220 of this article, with respect to the designated landmark or within the designated neighborhood conservation district. C. In the case of a landmark, the report shall be prepared by the Historical Commission. In the case of a neighborhood conservation district, the report shall be prepared by a study committee consisting of ~~three members or alternates of the Historical Commission and f~~ ~~our~~ five persons appointed by the City Manager, including at least one person who resides in the district under consideration, at least one person who owns property in the district under consideration, ~~and one person who owns property or resides elsewhere i~~ ~~n the City and has demonstrated knowledge and concern for conservation and enhancement of those exterior features of the City which are important to its distinctive character.~~ at least one person who owns and/or operates a business within the district under consideration, and at least one person who rents in the district under consideration. D. Any ~~ten~~ thirty registered voters of the City may petition that the Historical Commission initiate, or the Historical Commission on its own may initiate, the process of designating a landmark or amending or rescinding any such designation theretofore made. Any one hundred registered voters of the City may petition that the Historical Commission initiate the process of designating a neighborhood conservation district or amending or rescinding any such designation theretofore made. The Commission shall within forty-five days following the filing of such request or petition hold a preliminary hearing and arrange for the preparation of a report and, if required, request the appointment of a study committee. In the event the Commission requests the appointment of a study committee, the approval of the formation of such committee shall be by order of the City Council. If the Commission declines to request the appointment of a study committee, it must make its recommendation as to whether or not to designate the landmark or neighborhood conservation district within forty-five days of the original petition or request for that designation. The Historical Commission shall not reconsider a proposed designation, amendment or rescission of designation within ~~one year~~ ten years of its previous hearing thereon ~~, unless two-thirds of all its members vote to do so~~. No later than forty-five days after the transmittal of a report to the Commission pertaining to a proposed designation, the Commission shall hold a public hearing. The Commission shall give not less than ~~fourteen~~ thirty days notice of such public hearing by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the City and by mailing notice thereof to the owner of the proposed landmark and to every owner abutting the proposed landmark or within the proposed neighborhood conservation district, each such owner to be determined from the then current records of the Assessing Department, to the residents of every address within the proposed neighborhood conservation district, and to the City Manager, the Planning Board and the City Clerk. E. Prior to the public hearing, the Commission shall transmit copies of the report to the Planning Board for its consideration and recommendations. F. The recommendation of the Historical Commission with regard to any designation, amendment or rescission shall be transmitted to the City Manager and to the City Clerk with a copy of the approved designation report. Along with its recommendation, the Historical Commission shall include a report on the impact of the designation on housing and renovation costs in the district and a letter from each business association within, or within 500 yards of, the proposed district setting out their views on the proposed district, and the Historical Commission shall identify opponents to the proposed district and allow them to submit a letter setting out their views on the proposed district and a counter-proposal to the CHC's recommendation. Designation of a landmark or a neighborhood conservation district or amendment or rescission of designation shall be by order of the City Council. In the case of a designation, the order shall include a statement of the reasons for such designation and a statement of standards which the Historical Commission or neighborhood conservation district commission is to apply under Sections 2.78.170 and 2.78.190 through 2.78.220 of this article. G. No designation, amendment or rescission of designation shall become effective until a map setting forth the boundaries of the landmark or neighborhood conservation district or change in the boundaries thereof, has been filed with the City Council and has been recorded with the Registry of Deeds for the South District of Middlesex County. H. If the order establishing or amending a neighborhood conservation district contains provisions for both regulatory and educational/incentive programs, the regulatory provisions of the order shall not be effective unless and until the educational/incentive provisions of the order are funded. I. Following acceptance of a designation petition for a landmark by the Historical Commission, no application for a building permit for new construction or alterations on the premises of a property being considered for designation shall be granted until reviewed by the Commission as though the property were designated as a landmark ~~or a neighborhood conservation district~~ under this Article III. ~~Beginning~~ ~~with the~~ Following acceptance of a designation petition for a neighborhood conservation district by the Historical Commission and authorization of a study of the appropriateness of that designation by order of the City Council, and until (a) the Historical Commission makes a negative recommendation on a proposed designation, (b) the City Council determines not to enact the proposed designation, or (c) one year has elapsed, whichever is less, the Commission shall conduct a non-binding review of all proposed construction, demolition, or alteration that affects the exterior architectural features, other than color, climate resiliency features, or renewable energy features, of the structures on the premises of a proposed landmark or within a proposed neighborhood conservation district. The period during which these rules and procedures apply may not be extended other than due to a declared emergency. J. Notwithstanding the prior provisions of this section 2.78.180, a neighborhood conservation district previously established by order of the City Council, in accordance with this section, which order instructs that there be a review of the activities of the neighborhood conservation district commission established pursuant to that order, following one or more public hearings by such neighborhood conservation district commission and by the Historical Commission, and a report to the City Council by such commissions containing a summary of testimony at such hearings and recommendations by such commissions for amendments to the powers, responsibilities and procedures of such neighborhood conservation district commission (including amendments to the boundaries of the affected neighborhood conservation district), may be amended by the City Council, in a manner consistent with the recommendations of such report, or be rescinded without the necessity of the appointment of a new study committee or of a de novo study process. K. Beginning in 2022, and every ten years thereafter, the City Council shall review each existing neighborhood conservation district and adopt an order (1) to renew the neighborhood conservation district unchanged; (2) to renew the neighborhood conservation district with more limited boundaries; (3) to renew the neighborhood conservation district with less restrictive rules and/or guidance; or (4) to discontinue the neighborhood conservation district. In the review process, the City Council shall revise the rules and/or guidance to conform with the current version of this ordinance, including setting a schedule for conformance of neighborhood conservation district commissions, upon vacancies, to the current membership requirements. In the absence of a City Council order renewing a neighborhood conservation district, the neighborhood conservation district shall be discontinued. (Ord. 1331, 12/14/2009; Ord. 1166 \u00a7\u00a79, 10, 17, 18, 1995; Ord. 1009A (part), 1984; Ord. 1002 (part), 1983: prior code \u00a7 2-147(k)(4)) 2.78.190 Review procedures. A. Except as the order designating or amending a landmark or neighborhood conservation district may otherwise provide in accordance with this article, the Historical Commission or neighborhood conservation district commission having jurisdiction shall review all construction, demolition or alteration that affects the exterior architectural features, other than color, climate resiliency features, or renewable energy features, of any landmark or within any neighborhood conservation district. B. The order designating or amending a landmark or neighborhood conservation district may provide that the authority of the Historical Commission or neighborhood conservation district commission having jurisdiction shall not extend to the review of one or more of the following categories of structures or exterior architectural features of the landmark or within the neighborhood conservation district in which event the structures or exterior architectural features so excluded may be constructed or altered without review by the Commission: 1\\. The application of exterior wall material in a manner that does not require the removal or enclosure of any cornice, fascia, soffit, bay, porch, hood, window or door casing, or any other protruding decorative element; 2. ~~ Alternations~~ Alterations to the exterior of existing structures that do not increase or diminish the size and location of windows and doors, cause the removal of any bay, porch, hood, window or door casing or any other protruding decorative element, or alter the appearance of a roof; 3\\. The exterior appearance of a new structure that does not require a variance or special permit under the zoning ordinance then in effect; 4\\. Signs, temporary structures, lawn statuary, or recreational equipment, subject to such conditions as to duration of use, dimension, location, lighting, removal and similar matters as the Commission may reasonably specify; 5\\. Terraces, walks, driveways, sidewalks and similar structures substantially at grade level; 6\\. Walls and fences; 7\\. Storm doors and windows, screens, window air conditioners, lighting fixtures, antennae, trelliswork and similar appurtenances. C. The Historical Commission or a neighborhood conservation district commission may determine from time to time after a public hearing that certain categories of exterior architectural features or structures, including, without limitation, any of those enumerated in this section, if the provisions of the applicable order do not limit the authority of such commission with respect thereto, may be constructed or altered without review by such commission without causing substantial derogation from the intent and purposes of this article.

Except as the order establishing or amending a landmark or neighborhood conservation district may otherwise provide, no structure designated a landmark or within a neighborhood conservation district shall be constructed or altered in any way that affects exterior architectural features unless the Historical Commission or neighborhood conservation district commission having jurisdiction shall first have issued a certificate of appropriateness, a certificate of nonapplicability or a certificate of hardship with respect to such construction or alteration. B. Any person who desires to obtain a certificate from the Historical Commission or neighborhood conservation district commission shall file with the Commission an application for a certificate of appropriateness, a certificate of nonapplicability or a certificate of hardship, as the case may be, in such form as the commission may reasonably determine, together with such plans, elevations, specifications, material and other information, including in the case of demolition or removal a statement of the proposed condition and appearance of the property thereafter, as may be reasonably deemed necessary by the Commission to enable it to make a determination on the application. C. No building permit for alteration of an exterior architectural feature of a landmark or construction of a structure or for alteration of an exterior architectural feature within a neighborhood conservation district and no demolition permit for demolition or removal of a landmark or of a structure within a neighborhood conservation district shall be issued by the City or any department thereof until the certificate required by this article has been issued by the Historical Commission or neighborhood conservation district commission having jurisdiction.

In the case of new construction or additions to existing structures a commission shall consider the appropriateness of the size and shape of the structure both in relation to the land area upon which the structure is situated and to structures in the vicinity ~~, and a Commission may in appropriate cases impose dimensional and setback requirements in addition to those required by applicable provision of the~~ ~~zoning ordinance.~~. A Commission shall not consider interior arrangements or architectural features not subject to public view. B. A Commission shall not make any recommendation or requirement except for the purpose of ~~preventing developments~~ rejecting proposals incongruous to the historic aspects ~~,~~ or the architectural significance ~~or the distinctive character~~ of the landmark or neighborhood conservation district.

DePasquale, City Manager, relative to Awaiting Report Item Number 20-58, regarding a report on creating a comprehensive digital, postal, and traditional media outreach campaign educating residents on the Cambridge eviction moratorium, tenants' rights, and resources available to at-risk tenants. In response to Awaiting Report Item Number 20-58, regarding a report on creating a comprehensive digital, postal, and traditional media outreach campaign educating residents on the Cambridge eviction moratorium, tenants' rights, and resources available to at-risk tenants, Housing Liaison Maura Pensak reports the following: Since April 20, the Public Information Office, in coordination with the City Manager\u2019s Housing Liaison, Cambridge Public Schools, Department of Human Service Programs, Community Development, and others, has implemented a multichannel campaign to educate residents about the Cambridge eviction moratorium, tenants\u2019 rights, and resources available to residents. City Website: In addition to posting news items on the City\u2019s website and highlighting them on the homepage, information was added to the COVID-19 Housing Resources page early in the pandemic and additional information was posted to a dedicated page created at www.cambridgema.gov/tenantsrights <http://www.cambridgema.gov/tenantsrights> to share more specific information and resources. To call out the information more prominently, a website banner image was developed with the help of the Information Technology Department and placed at the top of the homepage of the City\u2019s website at www.cambridgema.gov <http://www.cambridgema.gov/> In addition, a landing page for the Housing Liaison Office is being created to provide a space for general housing information to be accessed. The page will direct residents to specific services and resources for housing and housing related concerns of all types. Direct Mail/Publications: Information was included in several City of Cambridge publications mailed directly to all households in Cambridge. Specifically, information on the moratorium and housing resources appeared in several parts of the May 2020 CityView mailer, information on the Housing resources information line and housing stabilization fund in the September 2020 edition of The Cambridge Life Magazine, an article on the eviction moratorium and tenant protection was highlighted in the November 2020 CityView mailer, and the January 2021 edition of The Cambridge Life had a half-page callout on the back cover dedicated to the eviction moratorium and tenants rights and resources. Housing resources were also included in several direct mailers related to the COVID-19 pandemic and City resources that were mailed to households in 2020. Social Media: Information has been posted and reposted to the City\u2019s Twitter account, Facebook page, and Nextdoor account many times throughout the pandemic. This information has been amplified and shared by other City departments, community partners, and followers. Press Outreach: A press release was sent to our media list targeting Cambridge, regional, and other news outlets with information about the Tenant\u2019s Rights ordinance and stories were published in several publications. Email Outreach: In addition to information added to City\u2019s Daily Email update sent to approximately 18,000 subscribers, the City Manager\u2019s Office consulted with the Community Development, Inspectional Services, and others to curate a list of Cambridge property owners and managers. This list has over 800 contacts and was emailed directly with information related to the ordinance, their responsibilities, and materials to post in their buildings, etc. Multilingual Materials: Translated information related to the eviction moratorium and tenants\u2019 rights appears in multiple languages (Amharic, Arabic, Bangla, Chinese, Haitian Creole, Portuguese, Spanish) in the CityView publications and multilingual flyers with information were created and posted on the tenants\u2019 rights website and for partners to distribute those they serve. Cambridge Public Schools: The City Manager\u2019s Housing Liaison has connected with the School Department for their assistance sharing information with families. Housing information was included in several of the Superintendent\u2019s message and other email communications to families. A flier/handout was created, translated into multiple languages, and provided to the school department to disseminate to students and families with housing resources and information. Other: A flier/handout was created, translated into multiple languages, and shared with DHSP to disseminate through Fuel Assistance and Community Learning Center mailings and information. Ongoing Education, Promotion, and Monitoring: This past month, The City Manager\u2019s Office, Community Development Department, Human Rights Commission and the Department of Human Service Programs\u2019 Multi- Service Center have launched a city-wide campaign: Housed In Cambridge: Information to Open Doors. This Campaign is designed to educate and inform residents on housing opportunities and housing related resources and services and will include webinars, an interactive on-line housing guide and story map, a social media campaign and information materials. To date, 3 webinars have been presented during the past 3 weeks as part of Fair Housing month. Beginning in June, monthly webinars and trainings will be offered. We will continue to mention this information in our Daily Email Updates, via the City\u2019s social media accounts and website, and in City publications where appropriate. In addition, the City Manager\u2019s Housing Liaison is planning to work with the Public Information Office, Community Development, and others to streamline information about housing on the City\u2019s website and produce additional video, print, and other materials for dissemination. Communications will continue to be sent to our property owner and management list quarterly to remind them of their obligations. In anticipation of an uptick in eviction proceedings when the state moratorium was lifted, City staff began biweekly meetings with legal service organizations as well as pulling information on proceedings taking place. Thankfully, numbers have been very low in Cambridge, and we believe this is due in part to the strong and ongoing partnerships the City has built and continues to build with property management companies. They have helped get housing resource information to tenants to call the City for assistance before it\u2019s too late, and the assistance provided directly to residents through the Mayor\u2019s Disaster Relief Fund and the Housing Stabilization Program has helped residents tremendously. We will stay vigilant and continue to monitor trends and communicate important housing-related information to the community as there is some concern about upticks we may see in the coming months as additional assistance runs out.",

These mitigation funds were contributed by Regency Centers to the Harvard Square Improvement Fund as a condition of special permit #PB334. Funds will be used for the purchase and installation of public space improvements on Palmer Street in Harvard Square. Palmer Street is currently an underutilized public space in Harvard Square. Implementation of relatively low-cost tactical interventions could improve the quality of the public experience through visual enhancements and activation elements. Improvements may include tables and chairs, planters and other landscaping, paint or murals, overhead visual enhancements, and other interactive elements like musical pieces, magnetic poetry, or oversized games. These elements would be deployed in a way to emphasize the pedestrian-oriented nature of the street and draw new activity, while still accommodating delivery vehicle use. Improvements to Palmer Street would create a welcoming space to promote public life and economic activity. The Community Development Department initiated a public process in February 2021 to determine public space goals from the community and finalize a design for the space. A second meeting will be scheduled in June 2021. This project was also presented and supported by the Harvard Square Advisory Committee. Improvements are anticipated to be completed this summer.",

      "full_text": "A communication transmitted from Louis A. DePasquale, City Manager, relative to additional information on a Acoustic Music response currently on the Table. Following the City Council\u2019s discussion during its February 22, 2021 meeting regarding the above-referenced matters, the Cambridge Board of License Commissioners (the \u201cBoard\u201d) met on March 1 and 9, 2021 to discuss the question of filing a home rule petition seeking special legislation (the \u201cHome Rule Petition\u201d) that would authorize the City to allow establishments to have acoustic music performances at their premises without first obtaining a license from the Board. The Board had previously discussed this matter on February 10, 2021, and the Board\u2019s Chair informed the City Council during the Council\u2019s February 22 Meeting that the Board did not support filing such a Home Rule Petition. A copy of the March 9, 2021 memorandum from the Chair of the Board (the \u201cBoard\u2019s Memo\u201d) outlining the Board\u2019s position after the additional Board meetings is attached for reference. As outlined in the Board\u2019s Memo, after discussing the proposed Home Rule Petition during two of its subsequent meetings, the Board\u2019s position remains unchanged and the Board does not support such legislation regardless of the type of business it would apply to. The Board remains concerned about the safety implications of allowing such performances without a license, including, but not limited to, blocking of ingress and egress, compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, overcrowding, and the safety of employees, patrons, and first responders. The Board is also concerned about the noise implications of allowing such performances without a license. However, in its discussions about this issue, the Board recognized that the City Council\u2019s intent is for this amenity to be available to be used more widely by businesses that would not necessarily apply for this type of license, i.e. bookstores, markets, etc. The Board also discussed the fact that the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance currently does not allow live acoustic music performances in most districts of the City without the property owner first obtaining a variance. I understand that a petition to amend the Zoning Ordinance (the \u201cZoning Petition\u201d) is presently pending and was discussed at the Ordinance Committee on April 14, 2021 and that if enacted, the Zoning Petition would allow businesses with an existing primary non-residential use to have live or recorded entertainment as an additional primary use at their premises provided that the additional use does not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the gross floor area or provided that the entertainment is limited in duration to no more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the total hours of operation of the other principal non-residential use. If enacted, this change, together with the following relaxed process relating to the issuance of licenses for this use, would make processing applications for such licenses faster and more efficient. Provided live acoustic music becomes an additional allowed principal use at a non-residential property by the above-referenced proposed zoning change, the Board would create an application for a license for live acoustical music with no amplification except for one microphone, which would be used by businesses not generally licensed under G.L. c. 138 or 140. That application would be reviewed simultaneously by staff from the License Commission, Fire and Inspectional Services, and upon approval by Fire and Inspectional Services, the license would be administratively issued by License Commission staff after payment of a nominal fee, ($25.00/3 months, $100.00/annually), without a hearing before the Board. In addition, in terms of immediate relief, the Board voted to eliminate the requirement to advertise applications for annual entertainment licenses, including live entertainment, in a newspaper. This will eliminate the cost of advertising and delay caused by having these applications advertised but will still allow for the public process. Notification will now be made to abutters seven (7) days prior to the hearing, to allow abutters to attend or submit comments to the Board prior to the hearing, and an affidavit of notice to abutters will be required to be submitted with the annual application. Also, as of 2022, the annual license/renewal fee for acoustical music with no amplification except for one microphone for all license types will be reduced from $500.00 annually to $100.00 annually. The Board will continue to work with the City Solicitor to determine whether this change can be implemented in 2021. Finally, the Board has suggested that the City Council consider adopting the Board\u2019s recommendation to amend the Noise Ordinance to establish a more streamlined mechanism for ticketing violations of the Noise Ordinance due to the noise generated by acoustical performances by responding Police Officers or Inspectors/Investigators from the License Commission, Fire, or Inspectional Services Departments, rather than having those issues be presented to the Board for a hearing prior to the issuance of a ticket for a violation. Given the Board\u2019s concerns about the issuance of the Home Rule Petition, for the reasons outlined above, in addition to those set forth in the Board\u2019s attached Memo, I do not support issuance of the Home Rule Petition at this time; but I believe implementation of the above changes will streamline the process for obtaining such licenses as requested by the Council.",

PLACED ON THE TABLE IN COUNCIL MAY 17, 2021 In response to Awaiting Report Item Number 21-13, regarding next steps on implementation of Universal Pre-K, received from Assistant City Manager for Human Services Ellen Semonoff reports the following: The Birth to 3rd Grade (B3) Partnership is an organized system of support with the vision to ensure that high quality, early learning experiences are affordable and accessible to all children and families creating a seamless experience beginning with prenatal care through the early elementary years. Through these experiences, children will maximize their full potential academically, socially, emotionally, and physically. In the five years since its inception, the cornerstones of Birth to 3rd Third Grade Partnership\u2019s work has included (1) funding scholarships for preschoolers from low-income families so that they may attend high quality preschool at one of over a dozen community-based early learning centers; (2) the quality improvement program that supports early learning centers and home- based child care providers in achieving higher levels of quality through coaching, mentoring, and funding for upgraded materials; (3) professional development for the early childhood workforce that includes access to college coursework, professional learning communities, communities of practice, and (4) workshops on a variety of content areas; and strengthening the connection between the early childhood community and health, mental health, and home visiting programs across the city. The work to begin development of a Universal Pre-K (UPK) plan was intended to follow the December 2019 Roundtable with the City Council and School Committee where the City Manager and Superintendent of Schools and their teams presented the report of the Universal Pre-Kindergarten Study commissioned by the City and Schools. That report analyzed and evaluated two different models of UPK programs for four-year olds and recommended a preferred model and a framework of essential elements required to build a high quality UPK system. The preferred model, which was endorsed by the City Manager and Superintendent of Schools, was a mixed-delivery system in which UPK would be offered through a network of providers, including the Cambridge Public Schools, Human Services and community-based programs. This was the most common model nationally and is the model being proposed by the Biden Administration in its proposed plan. The report identified the critical elements of high quality UPK programs including: \u00b7 Meets the needs of families in term of location, hours, and weeks of care \u00b7 Equity of access \u00b7 Diverse, competent and consistent staff \u00b7 Research-based curriculum \u00b7 Developmentally appropriate indoor and outdoor learning spaces \u00b7 Systems for establishing quality criteria and on-going evaluation \u00b7 Robust family engagement and services Right now, programs that serve 4 year-olds include the CPS JK, Special Start, Scholars College and Montessori Programs, DHSP preschool programs, community- based programs, for-profit programs and family childcare. One of the biggest challenges today is that Cambridge does not have enough capacity in high quality programs to serve all 4 year-olds. Addressing this capacity issue requires addressing a number of issues including: \u00b7 Increasing the number of existing programs that meet the state quality rating standards \u00b7 Expanding the number of Cambridge children served by Cambridge-based providers that also serve children from outside Cambridge \u00b7 Exploring changes in JK-K school programs to create 4 year-old classrooms \u00b7 Increasing slots for 4 year-olds without displacing slots for 3 year-olds \u00b7 Developing a pipeline of qualified teachers and career pathways with a focus on a diverse workforce \u00b7 Increasing workforce compensation \u00b7 Implementing evidence-based curriculum The City Manager committed at the December meeting that the City would begin the process to create a Universal Pre-Kindergarten Program for Cambridge\u2019s 4 year-olds. He acknowledged then that there were multiple issues and decisions that would need to be addressed over the coming years and that the annual operating costs for such a program could ultimately exceed 20 million dollars, not including capital costs for any additional city or school classrooms. The initial steps identified that evening to begin the process included: \u00b7 Convening community-based providers for feedback and input \u00b7 Convening Principals and JK/K teachers for feedback and input \u00b7 Gathering additional data from Cambridge programs to understand how many program slots are filled by Cambridge children and how many slots which are not dedicated to Cambridge children could become dedicated \u00b7 Gathering more data about the Cambridge pre-school workforce including credentials and compensation \u00b7 Gathering information and feedback from families about their needs and interests Before the pandemic upended services and planning, there was a convening with the City Manager and the Superintendent of Schools and their teams with over 80 leaders and staff of community-based providers. In that session, there was lots of excitement and numerous concerns about how the creation of UPK, even as a mixed delivery system, would impact existing programs. For example, most programs serve 3 and 4 year-olds in mixed age classrooms and concerns were expressed about whether a new system would require serving 4 year olds separately. We made the commitment then to continue to work with programs as we moved forward. None of the additional steps that would have begun in 2020 or been continued in 2021 were able to move forward because of the impact of the pandemic. Teachers and Principals were focused appropriately on serving students virtually and then in person. Community-Based programs were struggling to figure out how and whether to re-open. Those programs that re-opened were serving smaller groups of children and so gathering data about slots, who was in them and how that might be able to be changed did not make sense during the pandemic. While it is still a challenging moment for schools and preschool programs, we expect to be able to begin the planning work as we had hoped to do in 2020. The list of tasks to begin the work remains the same. And many critical efforts did move forward despite the pandemic that support the city\u2019s effort to expand high quality preschool opportunities for 4 year-olds. First, the City has continued to explore opportunities to expand capacity for pre-school programs serving 3 and 4 year-olds. As the City Council knows, Just a Start has been working on expanding its housing development at 402 Rindge Avenue together with additional space for employment and training and other community needs. The City has been working with Just A Start to support creation of 4 additional preschool classrooms that would serve some of the unmet need for preschools, especially in North Cambridge. Just A Start is also engaged in planning around another housing development on New Street and the City has been working with Just A Start to explore whether two additional preschool classrooms could be built as part of that development. These classrooms are in addition to the 4 new classrooms being designed as part of the Tobin/Vassal Lane project. Second, the City committed to funding the expansion of Head Start\u2019s four Cambridge classrooms to full-day, full-year programs to better meet the needs of low-income families. Head Start was not able to open in person over the last year but has continued to support children and families virtually. Head Start is working with the Birth to 3rd Partnership now to reopen sites for the fall. In addition, the City has been working with the Cambridge Housing Authority to renovate or replace the Head Start classrooms as part of the Jefferson Park housing development so that the spaces for Head Start will be exemplary early childhood classrooms. Third, the City has through its own preschool programs shifted both the cost structure and the economic mix of the families represented in the programs. As a result of the preschool lottery, 50% of the children served through the City programs are now low income. The tuition each family pays is based on their income so that depending on family income, tuition is between 1% and 8% of family income. Fourth, the Birth to 3rd Grade Partnership has also created a new School Readiness Manager position that is in the process of being filled. The School Readiness Manager will lead the effort to ensure a seamless transition from the wide variety of early childhood settings in the community to the public school system. A key role of this individual will be to support the Executive Director in the UPK planning work. The Executive Director will work closely with the Assistant Superintendent for Elementary Education, the School Department\u2019s Chief Financial Officer and the Assistant City Manager for Human Services in moving forward the planning process. We look forward to reporting back to the City Council and to the School Committee on the progress of that work. Although the planning work has not moved forward, it is important not to lose sight of how critically important the Birth to 3rd Grade Partnership has been this year in helping to prevent an even greater loss of programming for young children. Although the expansion of programming and the launching of the UPK planning process was impacted by the pandemic, the Birth to 3rd team was able to provide deep support to its program quality and scholarship sites without having any of those sites permanently close as happened with other early childhood providers within the city, state, and nationally. Community-based early childhood programs and home-based providers alike credit the guidance and support of The Birth to 3rd Grade Partnership for their ability to adjust to the changing state child care requirements, continue to serve children and families, and to survive and thrive during the very tumultuous public health and economic crisis this year has brought; a time in which equity and access across our society became glaringly more evident. This qualitative information demonstrates the positive impact the work of the Birth to 3rd Grade Partnership has on the early childhood workforce, children, families, and the broader community.",

With more than 800 CRLS students having returned on Monday, nearly 4,100 students (61% of all CPS students) are learning in-person. These last 15 months have been long and challenging, and we are so proud of the hard work, resilience, and patience of our scholars, families, and educators, who have made in-person and remote learning successful. On Thursday, May 6th, the School Committee had a Special Meeting to appoint the Interim Superintendent for the upcoming school year. The Committee voted to select Dr. Victoria Greer as Interim Superintendent of Schools. This appointment is conditioned on the ability of the School Committee and Dr. Greer to reach a negotiated contract. On May 11th, the School Committee met for the purpose of voting on the retention of an attorney to begin contract negotiations and entered into an executive session for the purpose of discussing strategy for contract negotiations for the Interim Superintendent. On May 11th, our Student Members Nuriel Vera-DeGraff and Ana\u00efs Killian also hosted a Zoom Meet the School Committee event for CRLS students. Students asked questions about the School Committee\u2019s roles and our work thus far. CPS has updated two COVID-19 policies: \u00b7 Elementary level quarantines will not be automatic: in alignment with updated state guidance, CPS elementary school classrooms will not automatically close and quarantine in situations with a confirmed case. Instead, only those individuals within 3 feet of distance of the positive individual for a total of 15+ minutes during a 24-hour period will be directed to quarantine \u00b7 Quarantine period reduced from 10 days to 7 days: in alignment with quarantine protocols provided by private medical providers, Cambridge Public Health Department protocols, and the CDC, CPS quarantine periods will now last for seven days. Individuals may leave quarantine after 7 days with a negative test on day 5 or later and return to school on day 8 as long as the quarantined individual remains symptom-free. On the following early release days (May 19th, May 26th, June 9th), remote meal services will be consolidated to a few central locations: Baldwin, Cambridgeport, Fletcher Maynard, Kennedy-Longfellow, and King Open. Families are welcome to pick up two days\u2019 worth of meals the day before each early release day at any meal pick-up site. Graham & Parks teacher Karen Engels is a 2022 [Massachusetts Teacher of the Year (TOY)](https://urldefense.com/v3/__http:/track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/k29TRUB_K0eIDGh0nJ9maQ**A/AAAAAQA*/RgRiexoUP0Q-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZG9lLm1hc3MuZWR1L2FtYXppbmdlZHVjYXRvcnMvdG95LyNwcm9ncmFtb3ZlcnZpZXdXB3NjaG9vbG1CCmCSlOaZYLmLgjJSFGJraW1AY2FtYnJpZGdlbWEuZ292WAQAAAAB__;fn5-!!GolgDdAAPFHvrrz0!NqjIC5Yi6eKDyj4q9N_tLtz8DkwHiucvaLVy- ZSltt1cKYRwJVlyVSZCN92BwoMRz6Y$) semi-finalist. The TOY program recognizes an exemplary teacher who will serve as a liaison to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) and as an ambassador to other teachers in the state. Karen has been a teacher at Graham & Parks since 2010 and has been serving as a co-leader of the Grade 4 Collaborative this past year. As the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the use of the Pfizer- BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in children ages 12 and older and we have transitioned to fully in-person learning at all of our schools, I have worked with our Student Members Nuriel Vera-DeGraff and Ana\u00efs Killian to submit a motion for our [May 18th Regular Meeting](https://www.cpsd.us/UserFiles/Servers/Server_3042785/File/school_committee/notices/2021/5-18-2021_SC_RegMtg_notice.pdf) asking that the Superintendent work with the Public Health Department to explore and determine the feasibility of offering and administering the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at the upper school and high school buildings, as well as any other appropriate CPS facilities.

CAMBRIDGE CITY COUNCIL - REGULAR COUNCIL MEETING: May 17, 2021 COVID-19 UPDATE QUESTIONS COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER 1. What percent of COVID tests in Cambridge are being genetically sequenced? How are we keeping track of new virus variants reaching Cambridge? 2. It has been great to see some of the local Cambridge vaccination clinics. Can you talk more about how the City is partnering with community groups to reach Cambridge residents for whom English may not be their first language or who may feel more comfortable getting vaccinated in a specific community setting? MAYOR SIDDIQUI 1. There has been a community question around the need for children to continue to be masked at local playgrounds. Can you share the current policy and rationale publicly? 2. As of May 10th, the City of Cambridge announced remaining in Phase IV, Step 1 of the Commonwealth\u2019s Reopening Plan. We have received some questions around a timeline for when Cambridge may move to Phase IV Step 2 and the other anticipated re-openings based on the Baker administrations timeline, for example the State's May 29th increased gathering limits and permission for street festivals and parades or relaxing of guidance for bars, beer gardens, breweries, wineries and distilleries?",

DePasquale, City Manager, relative to Awaiting Report Item Number 21-25, regarding a report on monitoring drought conditions and an update on demand projections. In response to Awaiting Report Item Number 21-25, regarding a report on monitoring drought conditions and an update on demand projections, Managing Director of the Water Department Sam Corda reports the following: Drought Monitoring/Reporting: The Water Department continues to monitor drought conditions within the Cambridge water system. The monitoring consists of: the review and tracking of precipitation data (from our USGS gauging stations) versus local historic average monthly precipitation; review of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)/National Weather Service (NWS) long range (12.5 months) precipitation predictions; review of the US Drought Monitor and Drought Outlook for Massachusetts, New England and the US; Review of the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MADEP) drought status and current levels as defined by the Secretary of Energy and Environmental Affairs (EEA); review of the Cambridge \u201cRisk Based Drought Management Plan (2016); review of the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) water Supply Status (operating under normal conditions a/o April 1, 2021) of which we are a full water member and follow their MADEP Approved Drought Management Plan. The drought levels are updated on our webpage (please see link below) as they are declared by the Secretary of EEA. During the drought of 2020 we added inserts in the water bills about the drought status. We have restarted the notice with the mid-April 2021 water billing and will continue throughout the drought declaration period. We added drought status \u201ctweets\u201d to our daily water conservation tweets to inform Cambridge residents. Also, we have added the use of Cable TV for our drought information campaign. <https://www.cambridgema.gov/Water/administration/droughtstatusandwaterconservation/droughtstatus> Reservoir Monitoring: The Reservoir System capacity is monitored weekly and tracked monthly. Currently, the Hobbs Brook Reservoir, our largest reservoir, continues to be recharging while we draw only from Stony Brook and Fresh Pond Reservoirs. October through May is the typical time when our water system recharges. The reservoir system storage is above 90% capacity and is continuing to increase. The system capacity is below March 2020 but significantly above the March of 2016 and 2017 - the first and second years of the recent major drought. The City Manager\u2019s office is updated routinely, and the Water Board is updated monthly on drought, precipitation, water consumption information and the current Reservoir capacity status. Water Conservation: The Water Department continues to use social media to inform Cambridge of water conservation methodologies. This is in the form of daily tweets on water conservation tips, and updates to the Department Webpage (please see link below) monthly or more frequently as conditions/information changes. <https://www.cambridgema.gov/Water/administration/droughtstatusandwaterconservation/waterconservation> We are adding an indoor/outdoor water conservation pamphlet into the water bills effective the mid-April 2021 billing - the brochures were used last fall as well. The insert will be used twice a year, every Spring and Fall and they are sent to the entire city. We reinserted a water conservation comment on the water bills starting on the mid-April billing cycle. We have just added the use of Cable TV to send out water conservation information on the cable scroll. We will continue our water conservation efforts with Universities, large users and with other City Departments. This has included the installation of smart irrigation systems, as well as, when feasible turning them on later and turning them off earlier. We continually recommend the installation of low flow toilets (0.8/1.2 gallons/flush; energy star washing machines; aerators on all faucets; and refer all customers to visit the Cambridge Water Department, MADEP, USEPA and MWRA websites for many tips and techniques to conserve water. Water Demand Projections: The Water Department is planning to update the Water Demand Projections from 2011 that projected water demand through 2041. It is anticipated that this effort will take 6-12 months and will include the effects of the pandemic on our water demand.",

The proponent seeking such a special permit must demonstrate that the Green Roof Area is designed such that the vegetation will withstand the foot traffic associated with its anticipated use. The Planning Board shall also consider the potential visual, noise and privacy impacts of the anticipated use on neighbors. Unless such a special permit is granted, any Green Roof Area located above the third floor of a building that is intended to be accessed for use by building occupants or others shall be counted as Gross Floor Area. 22.34 Floor Area Exemptions for Patios or Decks Adjacent to Green Roof Area. 22.34.1 In non-residential zoning districts and in Residence C-1A, C-2, C-2A, C-2B, C-3, C-3A, and C-3B zoning districts, where a rooftop surface above the third floor includes Green Roof Area, adjacent open-air outdoor space intended for use by building occupants or other persons that does not meet the definition of Green Roof Area, such as a patio or deck, shall be exempted from the calculation of Gross Floor Area of the building, provided that the total space exempted in such a manner shall not exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the amount of Green Roof Area on the building and that all such usable outdoor space shall be set back at least ten (10) feet from all outer roof edges. 22.34.2 In residential zoning districts not listed in Section 22.34.1 above, where a rooftop surface above the third floor includes Green Roof Area, adjacent open-air outdoor space intended for use by building occupants or other persons that does not meet the definition of Green Roof Area, such as a patio or deck, may be exempted from the calculation of Gross Floor Area of the building only after the granting of a special permit by the Planning Board. The total space exempted in such a manner shall not exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the amount of Green Roof Area on the building and all such usable outdoor space shall be set back at least ten (10) feet from all outer roof edges. In granting the special permit, the Planning Board shall consider the location and orientation of the patio or deck in relation to adjacent properties and potential visual, noise and privacy impacts of the anticipated use on abutters. 22.35 Green Roofs Requirement 22.35.1 Applicability.

Following the School Committee\u2019s adoption of the CPS FY22 Budget, it will come to the City Council for a vote on May 19th. The Massachusetts Board of Elementary and Secondary Education (BESE) voted unanimously that the junior class will not have to take and pass the MCAS exam due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, juniors who earn full credit in an approved course and demonstrate competency in that subject will meet the requirements to graduate. However, members of the class of 2022 who want to be considered for scholarships such as the John and Abigail Adams Scholarship, must take the MCAS this spring or fall. Please visit the [CPS MCAS webpage](https://www.cpsd.us/cms/One.aspx?portalId=3042869&pageId=70096417) and [FAQs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ICfnGvD6Gnurk4VfYu4vBYg_tDTj4-6CE2TlgBtte3I/edit) for more information.

CAMBRIDGE CITY COUNCIL \u2013 REGULAR COUNCIL MEETING: May 3, 2021 COVID-19 UPDATE QUESTIONS COUNCILLOR NOLAN 1. Now that other cities including Arlington, Watertown and Worcester are allowing in-person library hours, and now that it is clear that surface transmission does not occur, how soon is CPL planning to open to in-person and accelerate book returns? 2. There has been concern expressed by some families and staff about the safety of the Longfellow building on Broadway for students moving out of the Tobin building next year for the construction project. What are the circumstances at that building in terms of physical distancing and ventilation systems which allow schools to operate safely? What are the steps being taken to ensure the safety of students and staff in a building that has less outdoor and indoor space? MAYOR SIDDIQUI 1. What is the plan to resume onsite vaccination for homebound individuals now that J&J vaccine has been reauthorized for use? COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER 1. The Governor has announced reopening plans for the next few months into the summer. Which areas can we expect Cambridge to lift restrictions and where will the City be more stringent? In particular, when can the City expect to see modification to the outdoor mask mandate?",

DePasquale, City Manager, relative to a request that the City Council authorize the City Manager to enter an agreement with the Town of Watertown for the purpose of performing sidewalk reconstruction work on a portion of Belmont Street that is located in Watertown. I am writing to request that the City Council authorize me to enter an agreement with the Town of Watertown for the purpose of performing sidewalk reconstruction work on a portion of Belmont Street that is located in Watertown. The street and the sidewalk on the north side of Belmont Street between Mount Auburn Street and Ericsson Street are fully within Cambridge, but the sidewalk on the south side of that portion of Belmont Street is located within Watertown. Belmont Street between Mount Auburn Street and Ericsson Street is included in the City\u2019s Five Year Sidewalk and Street Reconstruction Plan. The Department of Public Works and the Community Development Department have been working with the community to develop plans for the project. The scope of work includes repaving the street, installing new water main and services, reconstructing the sidewalks, maintaining the inbound bus priority lane and bike lanes, adding pedestrian crossings and raised side street crossings for pedestrians, and providing a new connection on Holworthy Street for people walking and biking to the new Watertown-Cambridge Greenway. As part of this project, the sidewalk on that portion of Belmont Street that is located in Watertown will be reconstructed. Attached is a drawing that depicts the portion of the Belmont Street sidewalk located in Watertown that will be reconstructed as part of this project. The Town of Watertown will fund the improvements in Watertown, approximately $383,000 of the $2,500,000 project. Since the majority of the project is in Cambridge, the City will contract and manage the work, coordinating closely with the Town of Watertown throughout the construction. The design is currently being finalized and the project is anticipated to be bid in the summer of 2021, with construction beginning in the fall of 2021. This has been a joint project between the City and the Town of Watertown. In order to facilitate the City\u2019s entry onto the portion of Belmont Street that is located in Watertown, the City will need to enter a \u201cjoint operations\u201d agreement with the Town of Watertown pursuant to G.L. c. 40, \u00a7 4A. Under that statute, the City Council must authorize the City to enter such an agreement. Accordingly, I respectfully request that you authorize me enter the above described agreement with the Town of Watertown on behalf of the City.",

and WHEREAS: Knowing the dangerous of the climate crisis and the history that fossil fuel companies have in hiding the damage of climate change, the City of Cambridge cannot in good faith invest tax-payer dollars in those companies; and WHEREAS: The Cambridge City Council has long supported divesting from fossil fuels; the Council passed policy orders in [2013](https://www2.cambridgema.gov/cityClerk/policyOrder.cfm?item_id=40775) and [2017](http://cambridgema.iqm2.com/Citizens/Detail_LegiFile.aspx?ID=5113&highlightTerms=divestment) calling for the Cambridge Retirement Board to Divest, and after a [report](http://cambridgema.iqm2.com/Citizens/Detail_LegiFile.aspx?ID=5768) from the Board stating that Divestment is not yet legal, the Council passed a [resolution](http://cambridgema.iqm2.com/Citizens/Detail_LegiFile.aspx?ID=8685&highlightTerms=divestment) in support of [H.3662](https://malegislature.gov/Bills/191/HD2817), which would authorize independent retirement systems to divest from fossil fuel companies and remains in committee; and WHEREAS: Private prisons helped to create the rise of mass incarceration, and the City of Cambridge cannot in good faith invest tax-payer dollars in an industry that profits from rising incarceration rates; and WHEREAS: According to the ACLU study \u201c[Banking on Bondage](https://www.aclu.org/banking-bondage-private-prisons-and-mass- incarceration),\u201d incarceration is at record levels in the United States, draining the resources of governments, communities, and taxpayers, while the private prison industry, which now holds 16% of U.S. prisoners, has \u201cseen a gigantic windfall\u201d in recent years; and WHEREAS: A [2012 Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/11pdf/10-1104.pdf) case ruled that inmates in private prisons, where a [disproportionate number](https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2014/03/13/289000532/why-for- profit-prisons-house-more-inmates-of-color) of inmates are Black, are not afforded the same rights as federally-run prisons; and WHEREAS: Cambridge residents should have the right to know that their city\u2019s funds are not being placed in the hands of any money manager or bank that has exposure to the fossil fuel or private prison industry;

and WHEREAS: The [Massachusetts Municipal Depository Trust [MMDT]](https://www.mymmdt.com/mmdt/home.do) offers municipalities pools of investment that are also allowed by the State, yet includes offerings that fund the fossil fuel industry with 2.5% in energy companies including pipeline builder Kinder Morgan, another 3.1% in utilities including fossil fuel companies, and banking institutions invested in fossil fuels; and WHEREAS: The Budget Department already seeks to use only local banks when investing CDs and other funds, yet has no policy on avoiding banks that fund the fossil fuel sector or private prisons; and WHEREAS: The [City of Cambridge Budget Book](https://www.cambridgema.gov/-/media/Files/budgetdepartment/FinancePDFs/fy21adoptedbudget/fy21adoptedbudget.pdf) Investment Policy states, in Section III, page 19, \u201cThis [investment] policy shall be reviewed during the City\u2019s Annual Budget and Public Investment Program process,\u201d and the budget adoption process will begin over the next month;

In-person and online learning will resume as usual following April Break on Monday, April 26th. There will be a different approach for the elementary, upper, and high school levels, based on the needs of the in-person expansion for rest of the school year. The staff planning days will be for infection control training and classroom setup in advance of the in-person dates. The staff planning day for the high school will be on May 5th and instead of having a full PD day for elementary schools, who are already in-person five days a week, there will be three new early releases on April 28, May 19, and May 26 for teacher collaboration and planning. The state is proceeding with MCAS testing this year. It is CPS\u2019s goal to make MCAS as minimally disruptive to students and educators to maximize daily, ongoing commitments to rigorous, joyful, and culturally responsive teaching and learning across our schools. Here are some key facts about MCAS testing for students in grades 3-8 this spring. Please visit [this page](https://www.cpsd.us/cms/One.aspx?portalId=3042869&pageId=70096417) for more details. \u00b7 Federal and state law require all students in grades 3-8 to take the MCAS in English Language Arts (ELA) and Mathematics, and students in grades 5 and 8 in Science, Technology, and Engineering (STE) \u00b7 There will be no negative impact to students based on their MCAS results or a family\u2019s choice to opt-out of testing \u00b7 The state has shortened this year\u2019s MCAS tests, which are expected to take 1-1.5 hours in math and STE and 2-2.5 hours in ELA \u00b7 This year, the state will not use MCAS participation rates or results to penalize schools or districts \u00b7 CPS uses a range of assessment tools to understand student progress and areas of need. Last week, I added a ceremony at the King Open School where the Consul General of Portugal, Jo\u0101o Fin do Lago delivered a generous donation of 122 Portuguese textbooks and a collection of children\u2019s reading books to the Ol\u00e1 Program. On Thursday, April 8th, the School Committee hosted Virtual Candidate Forums for the three finalists for the position of [Interim Superintendent of Schools](https://cpsd.tedk12.com/hire/ViewJob.aspx?JobID=3026).

CAMBRIDGE CITY COUNCIL - REGULAR COUNCIL MEETING: April 26, 2021 COVID-19 UPDATE QUESTIONS COUNCILLOR NOLAN 1. At this point in the pandemic, there is extensive evidence on mask use outdoors and the risk of Covid19 transmission. Being outdoors and not in close proximity for a prolonged period is an extremely low risk activity. If Governor Baker lifts the mask mandate statewide for outdoors, will Cambridge follow suit? 2. Now that anyone over 16 can get a vaccine and we are over the 50% initial dose, is there any sense that there is resistance to getting the vaccine? Any thoughts on how to ensure that all residents eligible get the vaccine? MAYOR SIDDIQUI 1. CPHD staff recently met with several Cambridge restaurant owners to get feedback on strategies to help restaurants with some guidance on air quality or posters that can motivate safe dining behaviors. Improving masks used by restaurant staff and assessing air turnover and placement of HEPA filter units were discussed as positive steps. The panel suggested that these safety measures are crucial to keep restaurants open. The panel also agreed that any way to convince establishments with indoor dining to collect contact info from all parties (or individuals) will be crucial during follow up contact tracing if there are transmission clusters. What are some next steps on these discussions?",

DePasquale, City Manager, relative to the appropriation of $750,000.00 from Free Cash to the Public Investment Fund Department of Human Services Programs Extraordinary Expenditures account, to provide necessary funds to implement repairs to the 3 swimming pools located at the War Memorial Pool Facility. I am hereby requesting the appropriation of $750,000.00 from Free Cash to the Public Investment Fund, Department of Human Services Programs Extraordinary Expenditures account to provide necessary funds to implement repairs to the 3 swimming pools located at the War Memorial Pool Facility. In 2019, $75,000 was appropriated for a study to determine necessary repairs to the concrete and circulation system at the War Memorial Pool, including design services. The Department retained the services of CDM Smith to perform a comprehensive assessment of the 3 pool foundations and 2 circulating systems. The assessment was completed in 2020 and confirmed that the aging pool foundations and circulating systems would be at risk of failure at multiple locations if significant repairs are not made. A full design process has been completed, including construction methods, materials, and drawings, to define the interventions necessary to keep each of the 3 pools operating safely. Working with the School Department, the Department\u2019s Recreation Division determined that the most appropriate and least disruptive time to do the work would be during the summer of 2021. The use of Free Cash to fund larger projects, such as this one, once costs have been determined is part of our planned approach to fund such projects which are outside the Capital Budget Process. I am recommending this appropriation to ensure the long term continued availability of this important School and City resource. With City Council approval, the project will go out to bid in April and it is expected that the work will be completed this summer.",

I am writing to submit the attached Zoning Petition which amends Article 8.000 of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance. The Law Department, along with the Community Development Department and Inspectional Services Department, have prepared this Petition to amend the Zoning Ordinance in order to comply with G.L. c.40A, \u00a76. A recent case from the Supreme Judicial Court (the \u201cSJC\u201d) has interpreted G.L. c.40A, \u00a76 to provide special protections to lawful preexisting nonconforming single and two-family dwellings. Bellalta v. Zoning Board of Appeals of Brookline, 481 Mass. 372 (2019). Specifically, the SJC held that if an alteration or addition to a lawful preexisting nonconforming single and two- family dwelling increases an existing dimensional nonconformity, but does not create any new dimensional nonconformities, the property owner is only required to obtain a special permit for the alteration or addition, and not a variance. This holding is limited to lawful preexisting nonconforming single and two-family dwellings. This holding is also in conflict with Article 8.000 of the Zoning Ordinance because presently in certain instances the Zoning Ordinance requires that a property owner obtain a variance for alterations or additions to a lawful preexisting nonconforming single and two-family dwelling, even where no new nonconformities are created. As an example, if a single or two-family dwelling is lawfully preexisting nonconforming because it exceeds the allowable Floor Area Ratio (\u201cFAR\u201d) and the property owner has planned an addition that will further exceed the FAR but not create a new nonconformity, by law the Zoning Ordinance cannot require the property owner to obtain a variance to allow the addition. Rather, that addition requires the grant of a special permit and finding that the proposed additional will not be substantially more detrimental than the existing preexisting nonconforming structure to the neighborhood. This Petition is necessary to bring the Zoning Ordinance into conformance with the SJC\u2019s interpretation of G.L. c.40A, \u00a76. The Law Department, Community Development Department and Inspectional Services Department will be available to discuss this Petition with you and with the Planning Board throughout the zoning amendment process.",

The provisions in this section shall not apply to any residential buildings that include affordable units. a. Embodied Emissions: As a condition of receiving an occupancy permit, the developer shall provide to CDD an accounting of the emissions generated by the construction of any Green Building Project. The Embodied Emissions shall be documented by a licensed engineer, using Passive House or other acceptable energy and emissions modeling software, and include: 1. Emissions for manufacturing all building materials used, including associated raw materials extraction, production and transportation. 2. Estimates for transportation emissions caused by delivering the materials to the construction site. 3. Emissions generated on the site by heavy equipment such as cranes. b. The Embodied Emissions shall not include: 1. Emissions associated with installing renewable energy facilities on site, including but not limited to solar PV and solar hot water, air source and ground source heat pumps, and any other systems that substantially reduce the future emissions of the building. 2. Emissions generated from human labor (e.g. individual transport, small power tools, food consumption, etc.). 3. Emissions for transporting landscaping materials and plants to the site. 4. Emissions associated with installing electric vehicle charging infrastructure (EVSE). c. Expected Annual Emissions. The developer shall present an accounting of the expected emissions to be generated by routine operation of the building over the course of one calendar year. Emissions will be calculated as metric tons of CO2 equivalent using a formula approved by CDD, taking into account the local emissions profile for the grid at the time the building is first occupied to convert grid electrical consumption (kWH) into emissions. The Expected Annual Emissions shall include: 1. Emissions from any permanently installed onsite combustion such as a natural gas boiler to heat the building. 2. Emissions from grid electricity delivered to the building for operating any permanently installed equipment and lights in the building, including but not limited to HVAC systems, elevators, and light fixtures. d. The Expected Annual Emissions calculation shall not include: 1. Renewable energy systems such as solar PV systems installed prior to occupancy that net meter to the building itself. 2. Tenant plug loads and tenant installed onsite fossil fuel combustion (e.g. a natural gas appliance). 3. Backup generators. 4. Transportation emissions associated with the building operation. 5. Emissions associated with electric vehicle charging at the building. e. Lifetime Expected Emissions. The Lifetime Expected Emissions from the building will be calculated based on a formula approved by CDD, and will include the following: 1. The expected decline of grid emissions, reaching zero no later than 2050. 2. Expected emissions reductions under the BEUDO regime. 3. Any long term contracts to directly purchase 100% renewable energy sourced from the FERC New England region (such as solar or wind generated energy, or biogas) entered into between the building operator and certified (by CDD) providers of 100% renewable energy shall be subtracted from the total. For example, if the developer has signed a contract for 10 years for the total expected grid electrical consumption to come from renewable sources, the first 10 years of grid electrical consumption shall be considered emissions free and would not contribute to the lifetime expected total emissions. 4. The formula will assume that no grid emissions will be generated by the building past 2050, and that any onsite fossil fuel equipment will also have been replaced by 2050, so that the building emissions will be modeled as a declining schedule reaching zero no later than 2050. f. Total Emissions. The Total Emissions expected to be generated by the building will be the sum of the Embodied Emissions and the Lifetime Expected Emissions. g. The developer will present a payment schedule for how to zero out the Total Emissions of the building, using a social cost of carbon formula approved by CDD. The payment schedule may be annualized over a period not to exceed 10 years. The outstanding balance shall act as a lien on the property in case it is sold. Any offset must demonstrate direct benefits to low-income and minority communities in Cambridge, including economic opportunity through job creation and or financial savings through e.g. utility bill reductions. Acceptable offsets must be approved by CDD, and will include: 1. No less than 25% of the mitigation funds shall be spent on green jobs development programs, including education and training, to help build capacity for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects in Cambridge. Any such program must be free of cost to participants, and successful completion of the program must lead to a certification in a specific skill such as, for example: Solar Installer, Weatherization Installer and Technician, Building Energy Analyst, Urban Forestry or Urban Agriculture. Specific criteria and certifications will be set by CDD via regulation. 2. Payment for energy efficiency upgrades to existing buildings located in the City of Cambridge. 3. Payment into the City of Cambridge Renewable Energy and Greenhouse Gas Reduction Revolving Fund for reducing emission in public projects, including affordable housing developments. 4. Payment for the installation of new solar PV systems to be located in the City of Cambridge. 5. Payment for the creation of community solar PV installations that benefit Cambridge residents by making discounted solar generated electricity available to them. Such systems need not be located in Cambridge but must be located in the Northeast Massachusetts and Boston (NEMA) load zone. 6. Payment for direct supply contracts of 100% renewable electricity from sources within the FERC ISO New England assigned to another building(s) in the City of Cambridge, including via participation in Cambridge\u2019s Community Choice Electricity (CCE) program.",

CAMBRIDGE CITY COUNCIL - REGULAR COUNCIL MEETING: April 5, 2021 COVID-19 UPDATE QUESTIONS VICE MAYOR MALLON 1. How is CPH working to ensure that unsheltered, unhoused residents are fully vaccinated? Is CPH working with the First Step Outreach van and HSHS street outreach team to administer vaccines to unhoused residents who did not receive them while in shelter? 2. How are we ensuring Cambridge residents, or employees at organizations based in Cambridge, who do not have legal status feel safe making an appointment and getting vaccinated? The federal program administered through the drugstore program ask for State ID's, and in this eligibility group, a paystub/work ID is required to prove eligibility which many residents who do not have legal status cannot provide. How are we providing a) access to vaccines safely to these vulnerable residents and/or b) marketing information on which clinics do not ask for ID/paystubs to our residents without legal status? COUNCILLOR NOLAN 1. The City council unanimously passed a policy order asking the city to waive all operating fees for businesses, including licenses, weights and measures, annual fees, etc. Since other cities like Somerville waived fees, the Council asked for Cambridge to at least match that and do even more in light of our resources. All the business associations in the city supported that order and confirmed that it would be helpful. Businesses have had some financial help - the community foundation, mayor\u2019s relief, federal funding, but those do not come close to filling the gaps. Small businesses across the city are still struggling and need help. To date the city has only waived 40% of a few license fees (liquor licenses) and not waived any other fees. The total impact to date has been a loss of $800,000. The city is scheduled to get $87 million in additional unplanned for funds from the American Rescue Plan, which can be used for these purposes. What are the plans for waiving more fees? 2. Cambridge continues to have relatively low number of new cases compared to the county and the state and low hospitalization and thankfully few new deaths. However, we are terrible compared to many other countries and still experiencing new cases daily. Of the new cases, do we have any sense of the origin and whether it is the new variants? We know the age is trending down, and it is primarily younger residents. Are we still doing any contact tracing and/or interview to understand how the cases are being spread? MAYOR SIDDIQUI 1. Can you share with the public what we\u2019re learning about vaccines in children? 2. When vaccine supply becomes available, what is the plan to reach residents in North Cambridge, where we see one of the highest COVID case rates? COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER 1. It was great to see the announcement that Riverbend Park will be open on Saturdays and Sundays starting on April 10. Thank you to the City Manager and staff for working with DCR to make this happen. Besides outdoor-dining, what are the current plans to give residents more space on City-owned streets for the duration of the pandemic via the shared streets program or other programs? 2. With all Massachusetts residents age 16+ soon being eligible to receive the vaccine starting on April 19, what is the City doing to get this information out to Cambridge residents and what should residents know about signing up for a vaccination (where to sign up, how long delays based on supply of doses may be, etc.)?",

      "full_text": "That the City Council go on record proclaiming April 5\u201311, 2021 as Cambridge Public Health Week in appreciation of the extensive work on the part of the public and private sectors in the city to create a better, more inclusive, more just community. WHEREAS: It has come to the attention of the City Council that National Public Health Week, organized by the American Public Health Association, is celebrated across the country from April 5\u201311 with a focus on creating a better, more inclusive, more just world through public health; and ---|--- WHEREAS: The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed longstanding health inequities that have taken a devastating toll on Black, Latinx, and other vulnerable populations in Cambridge and the nation. The global health crisis has brought into clear focus that people with fewer societal advantages, such as access to quality education, higher-paying jobs, safe housing and neighborhoods, and quality medical care, bear a disproportionate burden of disease; and WHEREAS: Cambridge is a city with a deep commitment to social justice that values its racially and ethnically diverse population, and despite efforts to pursue equitable policies, the data indicates that continued health disparities based on race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status persist in the City as they do nationally; and WHEREAS: In Cambridge, the cumulative COVID-19 infection rate since the beginning of the pandemic when compared to White residents is 2.5 times higher among Black residents, 2.9 times higher among Latinx residents, and 8 times higher among residents identifying as \u201cOther,\u201d a category that includes residents who are multiracial or who reported nationality in lieu of a listed category. While the death rates of Black, and Latinx residents are slightly above those of White residents, the death rate of residents identifying as \u201cOther\u201d is 3.3 times that of White residents; and WHEREAS: In Cambridge, we established Citywide collaborations and innovations throughout the pandemic to address and mitigate these inequities, with particular focus in neighborhoods disproportionately impacted by illness and death due to COVID-19, including: the provision of universal 7 day/week COVID-19 testing; formation of the Cambridge Pandemic Collaborative\u2014comprised of public and private partners\u2014to assist with testing and vaccine administration; implementation of Wastewater surveillance as an early warning system; and, establishment of the Cambridge Community Corps to provide outreach and support to hard-to-reach and vulnerable communities; and, as a demonstration that our outreach efforts have been successful, Cambridge is currently outpacing the state in vaccinating Black and Hispanic residents; and WHEREAS: In fall 2020, the Cambridge Public Health Department released the second edition of the Cambridge Community Health Assessment, which summarizes available data on demographics, physical and mental health, safety and violence, food access, housing, transportation, racism and discrimination, and other issues; and WHEREAS: Based on assessment findings, community stakeholders and health department staff identified three priorities for the City's new Community Health Improvement Plan: community and social resilience; healthy eating and active living; and mental health, with cross-cutting themes of health equity and racism as assured by Equity Champions; and WHEREAS: In addition to work set forth in the Community Health Improvement Plan, the Cambridge Public Health Department\u2014in partnership with the Department of Human Service Programs, the Community Development Department and any other City Departments\u2014shall conduct ongoing and enhanced analysis using all available data to understand the complexity of the societal, environmental, and behavioral factors that contribute to the impact of racism on access to those resources that promote good health, including good jobs, access to healthy and affordable food and housing, equitable transportation options, and excellent public education; now therefore be it RESOLVED: That the City Council go on record proclaiming April 5\u201311, 2021 as Cambridge Public Health Week in appreciation of the extensive work on the part of the public and private sectors in the city to create a better, more inclusive, more just community; and be it further RESOLVED: That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a suitably engrossed copy of this resolution to Claude A. Jacob, Chief Public Health Officer at the Cambridge Public Health Department on behalf of the entire City Council",

DePasquale, City Manager, relative to the appropriation of $1,500,000, from Free Cash, to the Public Investment Fund Public Works Extraordinary Expenditures account, to purchase and distribute standardized trash barrels to all residential buildings in the City\u2019s trash program. To further help control the rodent population in the city, an appropriation of $1,500,000 from Free Cash to the Public Works Public Investment Account is requested for the purpose of purchasing and distributing standardized trash barrels to all residential buildings in the City\u2019s trash program. In providing standardized trash receptables the City will then have in place City provided trash, recycling and organics toters. Requiring the use of good quality, adequately sized trash receptables is an important additional tool in the City\u2019s continuing effort to reduce the rat population. Additionally, the provision of such will then allow residents further divert recyclable materials from trash and move the city further along in its Zero Waste goals. Based on recommendations in the city\u2019s Zero Waste Master plan, adding standardized trash receptacles to our program will provide the following benefits to both employees and residents: \u00b7 Reduces potential for Rodents. \u00b7 Increases worker safety as containers can be emptied with semi-automated collection compared to manual collection. \u00b7 Has potential for decreased workers compensation claims with better ergonomics and reduced lifting of containers/bags. \u00b7 Increases collection efficiency with a reduced number of containers. \u00b7 Increases diversion from trash to recycling and organics. \u00b7 Improves aesthetics of sidewalks with fewer containers at the curb and with a smaller footprint, \u00b7 Reduces trash spillage Similar to the roll out of single stream recycling toters, residents will be given a receptacle(s) based on the size of their property. Understanding the limited space that properties in densely populated sections of the city have, every effort will be made to provide receptacles that have enough capacity while minimizing their footprint. The program will also be flexible enough to provide smaller or larger receptacles to residents who request different sizes. The intention at this time is not to limit the size toter given to residents but rather to work with residents to ensure that the toter(s) they are given are large enough to avoid overflow situations and small enough to ensure that they can properly accommodate them at their homes. The picture below illustrates the various sizes we expect to offer residents. ![](/Citizens/GetImage.aspx?Type=25&ID=/Aspose.Words.e0a40571-617e-42b1-b3c0-4fbe6d2b7f76.001.png) At this time, given the disruption associated with COVID it may take longer than expected to procure and distribute these receptacles. Based on a conservative schedule, we estimate that these materials will be distributed to residential buildings in the city by the spring of 2022.",

DePasquale, City Manager, relative to the appropriation of $335,000 from Free Cash to the Public Investment Fund Public Works Extraordinary Expenditures account, to purchase and install Big Belly solar compactors on Cambridge Street between Inman Square and Lechmere Station. I am herby requesting an appropriation of $335,000 from Free Cash to the Public Investment Fund Public Works Extraordinary Expenditures account, to purchase and install Big Belly solar compactors on Cambridge Street between Inman Square and Lechmere Station. Funds will provide for 40 new compactors along Cambridge Street which will replace the existing Victor Stanley barrels in the area. This investment will significantly improve the overall appearance of the commercial district, reduce rodent activity along the street, and improve the collection efficiency in this neighborhood. Big Belly compactors transform public litter collection into an efficient, clean and well managed operation. These dual-purpose receptacles: one side is a solar-powered trash compactor and the other is a single-stream recycling receptacle will increase the capacity of litter bins on Cambridge Street and will quadruple the number of recycling receptacles in the area. The latest Big Belly receptacles are of a heavier gauge material and can be opened by floor peddle as well as by a chute handle. Because these bins compact trash and thus have approximately 5 times the capacity of regular trash bins, they need to be emptied less frequently than traditional trash bins. They also transmit data about fullness levels, notifying staff when specific bins need to be emptied. This enables a \u201cbefore full\u201d service by City staff and vehicles, thus reducing operating costs for collection as more such bins are installed across the city over time. Finally, given the solid nature of these facilities they have been shown to deter rodent activity in the areas they have been deployed in. The installation of these facilities further amplifies the City\u2019s commitment to working with the community in addressing this public health issue.",

DePasquale, City Manager, relative to request for approval to submit a Home Rule Petition that (1) would authorize the City of Cambridge (\u201cCity\u201d) to relocate land protected by Article 97 of the Massachusetts Constitution (\u201cArticle 97\u201d) at the Father Callanan Playground and Fields in Cambridge (\u201cCallanan Field\u201d) that are adjacent to the Tobin Montessori and Vassal Lane Upper Schools (the \u201cSite\u201d), and (2) would authorize the City to construct subsurface geothermal wells under a portion of the Callanan Field. I am writing to request that you approve the submission of a Home Rule Petition that (1) would authorize the City of Cambridge (\u201cCity\u201d) to relocate land protected by Article 97 of the Massachusetts Constitution (\u201cArticle 97\u201d) at the Father Callanan Playground and Fields in Cambridge (\u201cCallanan Field\u201d) that are adjacent to the Tobin Montessori and Vassal Lane Upper Schools (the \u201cSite\u201d), and (2) would authorize the City to construct subsurface geothermal wells under a portion of the Callanan Field. Specifically, relief is required from the Legislature to complete the Tobin Montessori and Vassal Lane Upper Schools Project (\u201cProject\u201d). As background, the current school building has equipment and finishes which are well past their useful life, and with the expected increase in student population, the building is in dire need of renovation and replacement. The Project envisions a new building which will provide for better stormwater management and which will contemplate a goal of zero on site greenhouse gas emissions. The Project will include low flow plumbing fixtures, heat pumps, a high-performance building envelop, geothermal wells, energy recovery systems, on site renewable energy, expanded use of natural light, as well as other sustainability features. The Callanan Field contains open space protected by Article 97. Land that is held and dedicated for parkland uses pursuant to Article 97 (\u201cPark Land\u201d) may only be re-used for another use with the consent of two thirds of both houses of the Legislature. Article 97 provides in relevant part that: \u201cthe people shall have the right to clean air and water, freedom from excessive and unnecessary noise, and the natural, scenic, historic, and esthetic qualities of their environment.\u201d \u201cLands and easements taken or acquired for such purposes shall not be used for other purposes or otherwise disposed of except by laws enacted by a two-thirds vote, taken by yeas and nays, of each branch of the general court.\u201d In order to complete the Project, some of the Park Land must be removed from Article 97 protection and utilized for school use. City staff have met with staff of the Commonwealth\u2019s Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs (\u201cEOEA\u201d) about the Article 97 issues associated with the Project. The City indicated to EOEA staff that it proposes to replace the Park Land that needs to be removed with about 40% more dedicated land than what it proposes to remove. EOEA staff indicated their support for the City\u2019s proposal with regard to the Project and more specifically, the City\u2019s proposed Article 97 Park Land replacement plan. As shown in the plan attached hereto as Attachment A, the existing site conditions contain about 193,540 square feet of Park Land, shown in green. The proposed new site conditions propose the removal of about 10,640 square feet of Park Land (shown in gray on Attachment B), and replacement with about 40% more designated Park Land than is being removed, for a total of about 14,500 square feet of newly designated Park Land (shown in blue on Attachment B), bringing the total designated Park Land at Callanan Field to about 197,700 square feet. Attachment C shows the proposed total designated Park Land, which will be in a contiguous parcel and will include numerous new park amenities, including newly renovated playgrounds, various new park features, rain gardens and trees, and a redeveloped recreational use path. The boundaries established in the attachments define the limits, more or less, of the building footprint and its relationship to the dedicated open space. This space only establishes the parameters of the community space and is not fully designed. Once approval is given the design team will meet will all stakeholders(Community, City & School) in subsequent meetings to finalize the design package. As noted above, EOEA staff have indicated support for the City\u2019s proposal with regard to this Project and the City\u2019s Article 97 plan. Relief is also required from the Legislature to construct deep subsurface geothermal wells under the Park Land, which are an important part of the Project\u2019s sustainability features. The proposed approximate location of the geothermal wells is depicted on Attachment C, shown in green with hatching. All existing public park and open space uses that are currently conducted in that part of the Callanan Field will continue to be conducted after the installation of the deep subsurface geothermal wells, which will have no effect upon the usability of the Park Land. In order to proceed with the Project, which will provide a more usable and comfortable school building, advance the City\u2019s sustainability goals, and increase and improve the City\u2019s designated Article 97 protected land, I ask that the City Council vote in favor of filing the attached Home Rule Petition.",

I am writing to submit the attached Zoning Petition which amends Article 8.000 of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance. The Law Department, along with the Community Development Department and Inspectional Services Department, have prepared this Petition to amend the Zoning Ordinance in order to comply with G.L. c.40A, \u00a76. A recent case from the Supreme Judicial Court (the \u201cSJC\u201d) has interpreted G.L. c.40A, \u00a76 to provide special protections to lawful preexisting nonconforming single and two-family dwellings. Bellalta v. Zoning Board of Appeals of Brookline, 481 Mass. 372 (2019). Specifically, the SJC held that if an alteration or addition to a lawful preexisting nonconforming single and two- family dwelling increases an existing dimensional nonconformity, but does not create any new dimensional nonconformities, the property owner is only required to obtain a special permit for the alteration or addition, and not a variance. This holding is limited to lawful preexisting nonconforming single and two-family dwellings. This holding is also in conflict with Article 8.000 of the Zoning Ordinance because presently in certain instances the Zoning Ordinance requires that a property owner obtain a variance for alterations or additions to a lawful preexisting nonconforming single and two-family dwelling, even where no new nonconformities are created. As an example, if a single or two-family dwelling is lawfully preexisting nonconforming because it exceeds the allowable Floor Area Ratio (\u201cFAR\u201d) and the property owner has planned an addition that will further exceed the FAR but not create a new nonconformity, by law the Zoning Ordinance cannot require the property owner to obtain a variance to allow the addition. Rather, that addition requires the grant of a special permit and finding that the proposed additional will not be substantially more detrimental than the existing preexisting nonconforming structure to the neighborhood. This Petition is necessary to bring the Zoning Ordinance into conformance with the SJC\u2019s interpretation of G.L. c.40A, \u00a76. The Law Department, Community Development Department and Inspectional Services Department will be available to discuss this Petition with you and with the Planning Board throughout the zoning amendment process.",

On January 29, 2021, the City executed a professional services agreement with The Collins Center, with deliverables including 2 memoranda presenting the major options of Forms of Government available to Cambridge, the key differences between these options, and a second memo summarizing the Council\u2019s feedback regarding the current Charter and Form of Government, providing options for pathways the Council might consider moving forward, respectively. As of March 11, 2021, the Collins Center delivered the draft first memo, which includes background on forms of government in Massachusetts, history of Cambridge\u2019s Charter and potential options for change. During the week of March 15, 2021, the Collins Center team met with each Councillor individually (individual meetings to conclude on 3/19/2021) to discuss the draft first memo, and to hear Councillor\u2019s perspectives and feedback regarding the proposed options. The next steps for the project will be to draft the second memo, based on the information drawn from the individual discussions and any recommendations that resulted from these conversations. The two drafts will then be provided to the Mayor and City Manager for review. All feedback from the Mayor and City Manager will then be complied into the final versions of the memoranda. The Collins Center (at the request of the City Manager or Council) will present the final memoranda, as well as answer any questions at a regular meeting of the City Council.",

CAMBRIDGE CITY COUNCIL - REGULAR COUNCIL MEETING: March 22, 2021 COVID-19 UPDATE QUESTIONS COUNCILLOR MALLON: 1. Parents are wondering what the DHSP plans are for a \"Spring on the Fields\" program as well as plans for IN PERSON summer camps and programming. Will DHSP be offering an outdoor afterschool activity program like they did in the Fall and if/when will they be announcing in-person summer programming plans. 2. Can you please provide an update on when the Cambridge public libraries will be open for browsing. The libraries have been closed for over a year for in-person browsing, and bookstores have remained open safely with state mandated capacity limits. This has created an inequity in who in our community can access new reading materials. As we continue to move toward an opening of other departments to the public, a plan with an opening date needs to be announced for this critical resource for our residents, especially our youngest readers. COUNCILLOR NOLAN 1. What is the current thinking on extending outdoor places in our streets and how will we include the community in discussions of whether the current parking spots and sidewalks being used will continue throughout the pandemic and beyond. 2. What do we know about a schedule for summer programs for all city sponsored programs, for adults and youth and children? MAYOR SIDDIQUI: 1. The federal government recently announced that they released vaccine equity funding to increase trust, vaccine acceptance and administration for the 20 equity municipalities- how is CPHD referencing these strategies for our continued local efforts for vaccine equity (even if we aren\u2019t among those 20 municipalities)? 2. After Cambridge Court Apartments, what is the next building to receive on-site vaccination? 808-812 Memorial Drive, 402 Rindge have a number of CHA voucher households with elderly residents. COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER 1. Now that the Metro North Regional Vaccine Partnership sites have been announced in Somerville, what is the City doing to publicize the launch dates to Cambridge residents and ensure that residents can access the appointments? COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: 1. Have Cambridge residents outwardly expressed specific concerns or hesitations around any of the available COVID-19 vaccines? COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN 1. Many scholars living in the Port, including in public housing buildings like Washington Elms and Newtowne Court, have relied on the 68 bus to get to CRLS each morning. The MBTA recently cut the 68 route as part of its \u201cForging Ahead\u201d service cuts. How has the city worked with the MBTA to ensure impacted scholars can still get to school on time? Has there been any direct communication between the city and the impacted scholars? While the MBTA has made some accommodations in the afternoon, has the city asked them to run a single route of the 68 bus in the morning so that those scholars can easily make it to CRLS? 2. 120 residents currently relying on the CASCAP Representative Payee program to obtain their social security benefits each month will lose access to their money when the program ends at the end of April 2021. Just 20 of those residents will be able to access the same services through BayCove. The $800-$900 that folks have been collecting each month from Social Security has been a lifeline during this historic pandemic, so it is important that we prevent a coverage gap. However, it can take up to six weeks to change somebody\u2019s Representative Payee, and that\u2019s assuming an alternative provider is even available. Time is running out. What is the city\u2019s plan to ensure homeless residents in Cambridge do not lose access to their Social Security benefits when they are already strained by the COVID-19 pandemic? 3. On March 18, 2021, Governor Baker announced that Massachusetts will reopen to Phase IV, Step 1. This means, among other things, that large capacity sports and entertainment venues will be permitted to operate at 12% capacity, gathering limits for event venues and in public settings will increase to 100 people indoors and 150 people outdoors, and that dance floors will be permitted at weddings and other events. This level of re-opening conflicts directly with the advice from national experts, as well as our own Expert Advisory Panel, and puts our community at grave risk of a COVID resurgence given the presence of new rapidly spreading variants, reduced testing capacity, and the nascent stage of the vaccine rollout. Will Cambridge re-open to Phase IV, Step 1 on Monday, and if so, what venues would be allowed to open in Cambridge that aren\u2019t currently operating, and at what capacity? How will we protect our most vulnerable residents who continue to bear the brunt of this pandemic, including our low-income and Black and Brown communities?",

(8) Housing Plan - providing the approximate number and mix of housing unit types proposed on each residential site; (9) Phasing Plan - describing the general sequence and timeline for the detailed design and construction of all major project elements, including buildings, landscaping, streets, and utilities, and the completion or conveyance of any public infrastructure or property interests; (10) Sustainability Plan - describing: (i) how the sustainability requirements set forth in Section 22.20 will be met; (ii) expected greenhouse gas emissions from the development and strategies employed to improve energy efficiency and support renewable energy production through individual building design and by utilizing existing or new district-wide energy systems, with reference to the recommendations of the City\u2019s Net Zero Action Plan; and (iii) expected vulnerability of the development to the effects of climate change, including increased precipitation, flood risk, temperature, and urban heat island effect, and strategies to promote resiliency within individual building sites and within the Master Plan as a whole, including natural stormwater management systems, increased vegetation and shade, and measures to withstand and recover from extreme climatological events, with reference to the recommendations of the City\u2019s relevant Climate Change Preparedness and Resilience planning documents; (11) Transportation Plan - incorporating: (i) a Transportation Impact Study required by Section 19.20; (ii) a Shared Parking Study that identifies opportunities for reducing the total amount of parking required to serve all uses through the sharing of parking spaces by multiple uses;

(12) Environmental Comfort Plan - providing professional assessments of the impacts of the development on neighboring properties and the general public in terms of excessive noise, lighting, wind, and shadows, and describing measures taken to mitigate such impacts through building location and massing, arrangement of uses, screening, and other building and site improvements; and (13) Architectural Character Plan - describing general approaches to the design of buildings, landscaped areas, streets, and pathways, identifying the type of visual character that the development will aim to achieve, with the expectation that specific designs of individual buildings and spaces will be reviewed in further detail as they are developed. 20.930.3 Master Plan Approval. The Planning Board may grant a Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Special Permit, incorporating any approved special permits for the Development Parcel, subject to the following provisions: (a) Criteria. In addition to the general special permit criteria set forth in Section 10.43, the Project Review Special Permit criteria set forth in Section 19.25, and all other criteria applicable to the special permits being sought, the Planning Board shall find that the following criteria are met when granting a Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Special Permit: (1) The Master Plan is in substantial conformance with the vision, goals, and recommendations set forth in the Alewife District Plan, including any amendments to the Alewife District Plan or future City planning reports that address the Alewife District, including but not limited to the topics of land use, open space, urban form, mobility, climate and environment, housing, economy, and zoning, and with any urban design guidelines published by the City pursuant to the Alewife District Plan or any amendments thereto or future planning reports that address the Alewife District; (2) The Master Plan is in substantial conformance with applicable standards for flood and heat resilience recommended through the City\u2019s Climate Change Preparedness and Resilience planning efforts or future climate change planning efforts; and (3) The Master Plan will result in the completion of a publicly accessible connection for bicyclists and pedestrians, at a minimum, across the railroad right of way between the Triangle District and the Quadrangle Northwest District, with conditions incorporated into the project phasing that will ensure its completion. A connection that accommodates passenger shuttles is desirable. (4) Housing - The revised zoning requires that a development proposal must be in general conformance with the Alewife District Plan, which would include land use. The Alewife District Plan calls for residential use west of the extension of Spinelli Place, which is about 40-50% of the anticipated development area. If desired, the Council could add provisions in the \u201cCriteria for Approval\u201d section such as a minimum amount or percentage of residential use, and/or requirements for phasing. An approach used in past mixed-use developments has been to require the residential phase to commence before 60% of permitted commercial uses are built, and to complete the residential phase before or concurrently with the completion of commercial uses. Within these constraints, a timing and phasing plan for the development would be subject to review and approval by the Planning Board. (5) Parking - This is also part of the required conformance with the Alewife District Plan as included in the revised text. As in other areas of redevelopment, the Alewife District Plan anticipates that parking would be used flexibly to serve uses throughout the area at different times while minimizing the number of parking spaces provided. Minimum parking ratios by use would be eliminated except for a smaller minimum for housing to mitigate possible impacts on public street parking, and maximum parking ratios by use would be established as follows: a. Retail: maximum 1.5 per 1,000 SF b. Office: maximum 1.1 per 1,000 SF c. R&D: maximum 0.8 per 1,000 SF d. Industrial: maximum 0.5 per 1,000 SF e. Residential: maximum 0.75 per dwelling unit, minimum .25 per dwelling unit (b) Conditions. The Quadrangle Northwest District Master Plan Special Permit shall set forth conditions to ensure that the applicable criteria are met, including but not limited to the following conditions: (1) Approved land uses and dimensional characteristics of the Master Plan at an aggregate level and for individual building sites; (2) Required public improvements and other benefits such as infrastructure and open space; (3) Required measures to mitigate development impacts, including but not limited to transportation impacts and construction activity; (4) Procedures for review and approval of the designs of individual buildings, open spaces, public improvements, and other components of the Master Plan; and (5) Timing and phasing for completion of the different components of the Master Plan, including but not limited to required public improvements, benefits, and mitigation. (c) Commencement. The commencement of construction of any single building approved in a Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Special Permit shall constitute exercise of the special permit for purposes of M.G.L. Chapter 40A and Section 10.46 of this Zoning Ordinance. The timing of completion shall be set forth by the Planning Board in the conditions of the special permit, which timing may be extended by the Planning Board upon a showing of good cause, and shall be subject to other conditions related to timing and phasing set forth in the special permit conditions. (d) Amendments. A Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Special Permit may identify specific modifications to the Master Plan that may be subject to future approval by a written determination of the Planning Board. Otherwise, the Planning Board shall determine whether a proposed modification is a Major Amendment or Minor Amendment according to the standards set forth in Sections 12.37.1 through 12.37.3 of this Zoning Ordinance. 20.930.4 Modifications to Standards. Except as otherwise set forth herein, any project receiving a Quadrangle Northwest District Master Plan Special Permit shall comply with all other applicable development standards set forth in this Zoning Ordinance. The following modifications may be authorized by the Planning Board upon granting a Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Special Permit: (1) The Additional FAR provisions of Paragraph (1) of Section 20.95.11 of this Zoning Ordinance may be applied to a Quadrangle Northwest Development Parcel in its entirety if the proposed development incorporates construction of a publicly accessible pedestrian and bicycle bridge connection across the railroad right of way between the Quadrangle Northwest District and the Triangle District or incorporation of structural elements into a building's design that includes or would permit future construction of such a pedestrian connection (that are acceptable to the City for that purpose), as well as the conveyance (in a form acceptable to the City) of the necessary fee or easement property interests in land that would permit access to such a connection, in a manner and to an extent determined to be sufficient to significantly advance the objectives of the Alewife District Plan . (2) The height of any building, regardless of use, may be increased to a maximum of eighty-five (85) feet, but shall remain subject to the limitations of Section 20.95.2, Paragraph 1(a) within 100 feet or 200 feet of a residential or Open Space district, provided the Planning Board finds that the entire leasable ground story of any non-residential building (excluding entrances/exits, lobbies, circulation, utilities, loading, and other functions necessary to serve upper-story uses or the building as a whole) is planned, designed, and constructed for the occupancy of light industrial uses and/or businesses that require light industrial space but also include a consumer- facing or community-focused component as described in the Economy Recommendations of the Alewife District Plan, with floor-to-ceiling heights that the Board finds to be suitable for such uses. The Planning Board may approve a limited number of Retail and Consumer Service Establishments to provide neighborhood amenities if they do not collectively occupy more than twenty percent (20%) of any building\u2019s total Ground Story and the Board finds that they do not detract from the emphasis on light industrial spaces as described in the Alewife District Plan. A residential building, which may include above-grade structured parking that is located to the rear of and visually screened from the street by principal-use residential space, may also be increased to a maximum of eight-five (85) feet without being required to meet the other requirements of this Paragraph. (3) If the Planning Board finds that the ground story of any building requires elevation above the existing mean grade in order to conform to flood resilience standards as established by the City, then the maximum height of any building may be further increased by not more than four (4) feet or the difference between the ground story finished floor elevation and the existing mean grade, whichever is lesser. To make such finding, the Planning Board shall have received and reviewed a written report from the City Engineer describing flood resilience standards applicable and the impact of those standards to the development site. (4) Spaces within the ground story of any non-residential building that are reserved for light industrial uses or businesses that require light industrial space but also include a consumer-facing or community-focused component as described in the Economy Recommendations of the Alewife District Plan may be excluded from the calculation of Gross Floor Area for the purpose of applying the limitations and requirements of this Zoning Ordinance, provided that the dimensions of such spaces, their permitted range of approved uses, and other conditions to ensure that the intent of the Alewife District Plan is met shall be set forth in writing by the Planning Board in the Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Special Permit. (5) Applicable minimum parking requirements shall be waived, and the Planning Board shall set forth maximum limitations and other conditions pertaining to the development and operation of off-street parking facilities in accordance with the Mobility Recommendations of the Alewife District Plan. (6) Applicable yard requirements and limitations, with the exception of requirements for yards abutting a residential or Open Space district as set forth in Paragraph (2) of Section 20.95.31 of this Zoning Ordinance, shall be modified to the extent necessary to conform to the recommended building setbacks and street sections recommended in the Urban Form and Mobility Recommendations of the Alewife District Plan, as approved by the Planning Board.",

Commissioner Riley made the following announcements on Tuesday, March 9th (the full guidance is [here](https://urldefense.com/v3/__http:/track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/6e5i2p-JRcUzKVjRywKYHg**A/AAAAAQA*/RgRiKo2xP0RJaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZG9lLm1hc3MuZWR1L2NvdmlkMTkvb24tZGVza3RvcC9pbi1wZXJzb24tbGVhcm5pbmctZ3VpZGUuZG9jeFcHc2Nob29sbUIKYEgxWklg3gROolIZc3NpZGRpcXVpQGNhbWJyaWRnZW1hLmdvdlgEAAAAAQ**A__;fn5-fn4!!GolgDdAAPFHvrrz0!I5O7WXbyKlut01-iEjYuen_0fSD7eCO5VrKThciSbUEziKzIrctI076Nxafx_ZvaJdrf1FE$)): \u00b7 For elementary schools (grades K-5), hybrid and remote learning models will no longer count towards meeting the required student learning time hours as of Monday, April 5th, 2021\\. As a result, districts and schools are required to shift their learning model to full-time, in-person instruction, five days a week, for elementary grade levels, effective Monday, April 5th, 2021 \u00b7 For middle schools (grades 6-8), hybrid and remote learning models will no longer count towards meeting the required student learning time hours as of Wednesday, April 28th, 2021. As a result, districts and schools are required to shift their learning model to full-time, in-person instruction, five days a week, for middle school grade levels, Monday, April 28th, 2021 \u00b7 For high schools (grades 9-12), details and timing will be announced next month. Districts will be notified at least two weeks in advance of the date that high school students must return to full-time, in-person instruction. Districts are being told to prepare plans now Families will still have the choice for a fully remote option and should be asked about their preference for this expansion. Physical distancing between students should be at least 3 feet in classrooms and 6 feet during mealtimes, while adults should maintain 6 feet of distancing between students and other staff when feasible. While the regulations and documentation do not present much flexibility, we are working to get answers from DESE as quickly as possible and we hope to have more information very soon about next steps. CPS has been expanding in- person learning successfully with the implementation of our student surveillance testing and all of our infection control protocols. Governor Baker has announced [additional details](https://www.mass.gov/info- details/covid-19-vaccinations-for-k-12-educators-child-care-workers-and- school-staff) about vaccine appointments available to K-12 staff. Anyone who is employed on a full or part-time basis by CPS is now eligible, including educators, paraprofessionals, clerical and administrative staff, custodial staff, food-service staff, safety staff, administrators, bus drivers and monitors, and those employed by another organization to provide education or support in a school setting. IDs will not be necessary, and eligibility will be confirmed by signing a form when appointments are booked or during check- in.

On Wednesday, March 10th, CPS was granted access to 100 vaccines through the Cambridge Health Alliance with the requirement that they would be administered within the following two days. CPS, in conjunction with the Cambridge Public Health Department, made the decision to offer these doses on a first-come- first-serve basis to food services staff, custodians, maintenance, and safety specialist staff.

CAMBRIDGE CITY COUNCIL - REGULAR COUNCIL MEETING: March 15, 2021 COVID-19 UPDATE QUESTIONS COUNCILLOR NOLAN: 1. Some city staff have been working throughout the pandemic, and some have had some additional work, and some have had curtailed work due to office restrictions and quarantines. Now that the City and Commonwealth are able to see the light at the end of the tunnel, what can we expect for restoration of city services? As an example, the City extended resident parking permits, but the delay hasn\u2019t been explained. Some paid for permits 8 weeks ago and have yet to receive them - hopefully that will be resolved soon. What city services have a backlog and when can we expect operations to be relatively normal? 2. As people return to work, and more commuting, we need people to feel safe using public transit, since the pandemic has led to increased single occupancy vehicle trips, which is detrimental from a number of perspectives. How is the city communicating with the MBTA about the best way to handle the migration of folks back to work? Besides requiring masks, have they been working to gear up their schedules to have more frequent service to avoid crowding? Will they use their T ambassadors to help ensure mask wearing and distancing? Will local companies do anything focused on safe, distanced transportation once they start calling folks back into the office? MAYOR SIDDIQUI: 1. What is the status of CPH reaching homebound individuals with vaccines? 2. As more vaccine supply becomes available with the hope that local municipalities regain more access, how and where would CPH host community vaccination sites? COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: 1. With recent approval and increased production of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine, when will we start to see it available in the Cambridge community, and is the lower efficacy rate a concern?",

      "full_text": "The City Manager be and hereby is requested to confer with the City of Cambridge Law Department to review the above changes to the language of the Domestic Partnerships Ordinance and report back to the Council. PASSED TO A SECOND READING IN COUNCIL JULY 27, 2020. TO BE ORDAINED ON OR AFTER SEPTEMBER 14, 2020 ORDERED: That section 2.119 of the Ordinances of the City of Cambridge, titled Domestic Partnerships be amended to read as follows: Chapter 2.119 - DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIPS 2.119.010 - Recognition and scope. A. The City Council recognizes the diverse composition of its citizenry and values its people. The City Council acknowledges that the people's lives have evolved from when laws governing family relationships were enacted. Perpetuation of the traditional definitions of \"family\" excludes a significant segment of the Cambridge population, deprives them of recognition and validation, and denies certain rights that should be afforded to persons who share their homes, their hearts and their lives. The City, recognizing its commitment to nondiscrimination and fair treatment of its citizens and employees, adopts this chapter acknowledging domestic partnerships. B. The chapter allows persons in committed relationships who meet the criteria established by the City as constituting domestic partnerships to register at the office of the City Clerk and obtain a certificate attesting to their status. The chapter recognizes certain right of access for domestic partners. This chapter, in conformance with the Human Rights Ordinance, which bars discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, marital status and family status, also equalizes the treatment of City employees. 2.119.020 - Definitions. As used in this chapter: A. \"Competent to contract\" means eighteen years of age or older, and mentally competent to contract. B. \"Dependent\" means a minor who lives within the household of a domestic partnership and is: 1. A biological child or adopted child, or foster child of a domestic partner, if the child is not provided with medical insurance coverage by the Commonwealth; 2. A dependent as defined under IRS regulations; or 3. A ward of a domestic partner as determined in a guardianship proceeding. C. \"Domestic partner\" means a person who meets the criteria set out in subsection D of this section or who is registered as such in another jurisdiction. D. \"Domestic partnership\" means the entity formed by two or more persons who meet the following criteria and jointly file a registration statement proclaiming that: 1. They are in a relationship of mutual support, caring and commitment and intend to remain in such a relationship; and 2. They are not related by blood closer than would bar marriage in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts; and 3. They are competent to contract; and 4. They consider themselves to be a family. E. \"Mutual support\" means that the domestic partners each contributed in some fashion, not necessarily equally or financially, to the maintenance and support of the domestic partnership. (Ord. 1144 (part), 1992) 2.119.030 - Registration and withdrawal. A. Persons who meet the criteria set out in subsection D of Section 2.119.020 may make an official record of their domestic partnership by filing a domestic partnership registration form with the City Clerk. The domestic partnership registration shall include the name and date of birth of each of the domestic partners, and the name and dates of birth of any dependents of the domestic partnership, and shall be signed, under the pains and penalties of perjury, by all domestic partners. B. Domestic partners may amend the domestic partnership registration to add or delete domestic partners or dependents. Amendments to the domestic partnership registration shall be signed, under the pains and penalties of perjury, by all domestic partners. C. If any member of the domestic partnership is married or in another domestic partnership, notice of the registration of this domestic partnership and/or of the addition of new partner(s) to this domestic partnership must be given, by certified mail, to any marital or domestic partners outside of this domestic partnership. D. Any person in a domestic partnership may voluntarily withdraw from the domestic partnership by filing a withdrawal statement. 1. Any person in a domestic partnership may voluntarily withdraw from the domestic partnership by filing with the City Clerk, by hand or by certified mail, a withdrawal statement. The person filing the withdrawal statement must declare under pains and penalties of perjury that they are withdrawing from the domestic partnership and that a copy of the withdrawal statement has been mailed by certified mail to the other domestic partners at his, her or their last known addresses. The person filing the withdrawal statement must include on such statement the address(es) to which the copy(ies) were/was mailed. The fee for a domestic partnership withdrawal shall be $5.00. 2. The death of a domestic partner functions as an automatic withdrawal from the domestic partnership as to that partner. E. If there are only two persons in the domestic partnership, withdrawal of one person terminates the domestic partnership. If there are more than two persons in the domestic partnership, withdrawal of one partner does not terminate the domestic partnership as to the remaining persons in the domestic partnership. The voluntary withdrawal from a domestic partnership by a partner shall be effective seven days after the receipt of a withdrawal statement by the City Clerk. Prior to becoming effective, the person who filed the withdrawal statement may retract the withdrawal statement as follows: in person at the office of the City Clerk; or via certified mail addressed to the City Clerk, provided the retraction is received no later than seven days following the date the withdrawal statement was filed. If the withdrawal statement is retracted, the domestic partner shall give notice of the retraction, by certified mail, to the other domestic partner(s). The withdrawal of a deceased person from a domestic partnership shall be effective immediately upon the death of that domestic partner. F. If a domestic partnership is terminated by the death of a domestic partner, there shall be no required waiting period prior to filing another domestic partnership. If a person voluntarily withdraws from a domestic partnership, that person may not file another domestic partnership until ninety (90) days have elapsed from the effective date of such withdrawal. 2.119.040 - City Clerk\u2014Fees. A. The City Clerk shall collect a reasonable fee for filing a domestic partnership registration. The initial amount for this fee shall be fifteen dollars and it shall be adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with the fee for an application for a marriage license. B. The City Clerk shall collect the same fee charged for marriage certificates for certified copies of domestic partnership documents, other than the copy of the certificate of domestic partnership issued by the City Clerk to the domestic partners, as provided for in Section 2.119.050. 2.119.050 - City Clerk\u2014Records. A. Upon receipt of a domestic partnership registration and filing fee, the City Clerk shall issue a certificate of domestic partnership and shall mail to each of the domestic partners one certified copy of the certificate and one wallet-sized card indicating the existence of the domestic partnership, the names of the domestic partners and the names of the dependents of the domestic partnership, if any. B. The City Clerk shall maintain records of domestic partnerships registered in the City, including forms filed and certificates issued. The City Clerk shall provide forms to persons requesting them in accordance with Section 2.119.120. C. The City Clerk shall allow public access to domestic partnership records to the same extent and in the same manner as marriage licenses. 2.119.060 - Rights of domestic partners. Persons who have registered their domestic partnership at the office of the City Clerk pursuant to Section 2.119.030 are entitled to the following rights: A. 1. A domestic partner shall have the same visitation rights as a spouse or parent of a patient at the Cambridge City Hospital and all other health care facilities in the City. A dependent shall have the same visitation rights as a patient's child. 2. The term \"health care facilities\" includes, but is not limited to, hospitals, convalescent facilities, mental health care facilities, and other short- and long-term care facilities under the City's jurisdiction. B. 1. A domestic partner shall have the same visitation rights at all correctional facilities in Cambridge as a spouse or parent of a person in custody. A dependent shall have the same visitation rights afforded to the child of a person in custody. 2. The term \"correctional facilities\" includes, but is not limited to, holding cells, jails and juvenile correction centers under the City's jurisdiction. C. 1. A domestic partner, who is also the parent or legal guardian of a child, may file a form at or send a letter to the child's school to indicate that the parent's domestic partner shall have access to the child's records, access to school personnel in matters concerning the child, and access to the child, including the right to remove such child from the school for sickness or family emergency. The school shall afford such person access as directed by the child's parent. 2. When a domestic partnership is terminated pursuant to Section 2.119.030, it is the responsibility of the parent or guardian to notify the school, in writing, of the termination of rights of the former domestic partner. 3. The term \"school\" includes, but is not limited to, high schools, vocational schools, junior high and middle schools, elementary schools, preschool programs, after-school programs and day care programs. 2.119.070 - Employment benefits. A. The City and School Department shall provide the same health and other employment fringe benefits to employees with domestic partners as to employees with spouses. As used in this chapter, \"employees\" refers to active and retired employees of the City and the Cambridge School Department eligible for benefits pursuant to state or municipal law, employment policies or collective bargaining agreements. B. Employees must file a declaration of domestic partnership, signed under the pains and penalties of perjury, with their department administrator or Department of Personnel of the City or School Department, as appropriate, in order to obtain benefits under this chapter. On such declaration, employees shall agree to promptly notify the City or School Department, as appropriate, of any change in the status or their domestic partnership. There shall be no fee for such declaration. Employees shall not be obligated to file a domestic partnership registration form with the City Clerk. C. The City and School Department shall provide medical insurance coverage to an employee's domestic partner(s) as it does to an employee's spouse, and to the dependent(s) of an employees' domestic partnership as it does to an employee's child(ren). An employee may opt to decline medical insurance coverage for her or his domestic partner, without foregoing the right to obtain medical insurance coverage for her or his domestic partner at a later date. D. Upon termination of a domestic partnership by an employee, the domestic partner(s) shall be covered by medical insurance for a period of sixty days following the termination of the domestic partnership. If the employee leaves employment with the City or School Department prior to the expiration of the sixty days, the medical insurance shall lapse on the date that the former employee's insurance lapses. E. Upon termination of a domestic partnership by the death of an employee, the surviving domestic partner(s)'s medical insurance coverage shall lapse as it would for the spouse of a married employee, upon the death of such employee. F. Employees shall be granted a leave of absence, with pay, for the death of a domestic partner or family member of a domestic partner to the same extent as for a spouse or family member of a spouse. Use of the term \"in-law\" in employee handbooks shall include the relatives of a domestic partner. G. Employees shall be granted sick leave to care for a domestic partner to the same extent permitted to care for a spouse, and to care for a dependent of a domestic partnership to the same extent permitted to care for a child. H. Employees shall be entitled to take parental leave to take care of a child born to their domestic partner or a newly adopted child to the same extent as a married person. 2.119.080 - Limitation of liabilities. A. Nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted to contravene the general laws of the commonwealth. B. Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to impose liability upon a domestic partner for the health or medical expenses of his or her domestic partner, with the sole exception of the medical insurance contributions assumed by a City or School Department employee who is a member of a domestic partnership. C. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to create additional legal liabilities greater than those already existing under law or to create new private causes of action. 2.119.090 - Reciprocity. All rights, privileges and benefits extended to domestic partnerships registered pursuant to this chapter shall also be extended to domestic partnerships registered pursuant to similar laws in other jurisdictions. 2.119.100 - Retaliation.

The state\u2019s Command Center will also identify specific days designated for educators and school staff. Governor Baker has emphasized that appointment availability will be dependent on the federally-provided supply of vaccines, which are currently limited. President Biden also announced that all states must prioritize all educators, school staff, and childcare workers to receive their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine by the end of March. To help states with this effort, a federal pharmacy program will prioritize the vaccination of all school staff and childcare workers during the month of March. CPS will work closely with the Cambridge Public Health Department (CPHD, Cambridge Education Association (CEA), and other unions serving CPS employees to provide staff with information about vaccine distribution and appointments. On Monday, March 1st, the job posting for the Interim Superintendent position of the Cambridge Public Schools went live. I will keep everyone updated on the progress of our search. Also on March 1st, we began our [expansion of in-person learning](https://www.cpsd.us/cms/One.aspx?portalId=3042869&pageId=69802566). My School Committee colleagues and I have been welcoming cohorts in the mornings outside school buildings as families returned. On March 1st, Superintendent Salim and I greeted King Open and CSUS families and on March 4th, we said hello to the families outside the Cambridgeport and Amigos schools. It has been such a joy to see the smiles on the faces of our scholars, who are so excited to be back. A few of our schools currently have waitlists for in-person learning: \u25cf Amigos: 6 students at grade 4 and 3 students at grade 8 \u25cf Baldwin: 7 students at grade 2 \u25cf King Open: 2 students at grades 4 and 5 \u25cf Haggerty: 1 student at K Based on actual in-person enrollment in the first week, additional students may be accommodated. In addition, the hardship request process has been opened to families. As you all know, we are offering free COVID testing to all in-person students, teachers, and staff. We kicked off our student surveillance testing with hundreds of students participating and have launched an initial pilot of the state\u2019s pooled COVID testing program for elementary school students.

CAMBRIDGE CITY COUNCIL - REGULAR COUNCIL MEETING: March 8, 2021 COVID-19 UPDATE QUESTIONS VICE MAYOR MALLON: 1. Based on the Governor's announcement this week moving school-based staff into eligibility, what is our local plan to vaccinate our school-based staff here in Cambridge? The State vaccination website is impossible to navigate, and CVS is fully booked each day. CPSD welcomed 4-12th graders back into the classroom this week, and it's important to get this done quickly and in a coordinated fashion to both provide a level of safety for our staff, as well as instill confidence for families that school is safe to return to. COUNCILLOR NOLAN: 1. Do we have a sense of how the increased capacity for businesses and movement to Phase 3 step 2 has gone? And in line with that question, what has our capacity been to monitor for compliance with mask mandates and provide support for entities that need help opening, re-opening, or expanding while following all the continued regulations about safe operations? 2. With increased vaccine eligibility and ever-changing availability of supply, there has been a lot of concern from residents about accessing an appointment for vaccination. What has been done, and what can the city do to communicate in a timely manner how and when residents can sign up for vaccines? Do we know which of the methods of communication the city uses are the most effective, and are there other methods other cities are using that we might emulate? MAYOR SIDDIQUI: 1. Can CPH share any more updated race/ethnicity data of who has been vaccinated? COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: 1. When the Senior Center re-opens to the public for in-person activities, will people need to show a \"vaccine passport\" or some proof of having been vaccinated in order to enter and partake of the in-person activities? COUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER: 1. Now that the Johnson & Johnson vaccine has been authorized, when can we expect to start seeing doses in Massachusetts? What do residents need to know about which of the vaccines they\u2019re getting? 2. New daily COVID cases in Cambridge have come down from the numbers we were seeing in December, but they are still 3-4 times higher than they were from June-October. What do we know about how Cambridge residents are currently contracting the virus? For what percentage of the cases are we able to identify a likely point of transmission? COUNCILLOR TOOMEY: 1. A lifelong Cambridge resident and senior citizen contacted me to express her concerns about the difficulty of getting the COVID-19 vaccine. The City of Quincy has a dedicated local vaccination site at their senior center; does Cambridge plan to set up a similar central site? COUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN: 1. Currently our 7-day average of new cases of COVID seems to have stabilized at about 4 times what it was in late March 2020 when we declared a public health emergency and shut down the entire city to prevent the spread of COVID. Several more infectious variants of COVID are circulating worldwide, including here in Massachusetts, raising the risk of a 4th surge driven by these new variants. Vaccine distribution in the city has been spotty and concerns of racial and economic inequities in terms of access to the vaccine have not been sufficiently addressed. Black and Brown community members in Cambridge are contracting COVID at rates at least 3 times higher than whites and are dying at rates 1.5 times higher than whites. I\u2019m hearing from concerned members of the community about their relatives dying and the city\u2019s failure to protect them. What is the scientific basis for reopening the city now to the degree that we are, including the complete lifting of indoor dining capacity limits and soon the opening of large venues, when our new case counts are stabilizing at such dangerously high levels, the risk of a 4th surge driven by variants is so great, and our Black and Brown community members remain disproportionately exposed? 2. More than 1 year into this devastating pandemic, the city has repeatedly refused to adopt a housing for all approach, despite the availability of federal funding to reimburse 100% of the costs of providing non-congregate shelter. What is the justification for this inhumane approach that leaves unhoused people vulnerable to the winter weather, COVID exposure, and the enormous stresses and mental health challenges of living on the streets? 3. Outdoor dining was a lifeline for many of our small businesses in 2020, can we get an update on when it will come back and in what form? How will we ensure that there is even better outreach to minority and women-owned businesses during the 2021 season? In particular, how can we bring the successes of Inman Square\u2019s approach (which included partial lane closures) to other neighborhoods that would benefit from such a dramatic intervention? 4. Additional open space created through Memorial Drive closures and the Shared Streets program was a lifeline for many residents in 2020. When will Memorial Drive closures begin in 2021, and is the city supportive of expanding them beyond the weekend? How can we learn from the successes and challenges of the Shared Streets program to ensure all residents have access to legitimate recreation space, including and especially residents of the Port, Wellington-Harrington, and East Cambridge?",

      "full_text": "A communication transmitted from Louis A. DePasquale, City Manager, relative to the City of Cambridge retaining its AAA rating from the nation's three major credit rating agencies. I am pleased to inform you, the taxpayers, and all our residents that the City of Cambridge has again retained its noteworthy distinction of being one of only 27 cities in the United States with AAA ratings from each of the nation\u2019s three major credit rating agencies. Since 1999, the City has received these ratings from Moody\u2019s Investors Service, S&P Global Ratings, and Fitch Ratings. These ratings are especially significant this year, as the COVID-19 Pandemic resulted in unexpected levels of uncertainty and financial impacts not seen by the City previously. The City has and continues to fund many new COVID-19 initiatives despite not being in the FY20 or FY21 budgets. Our ability to support these unforeseen initiatives is possible because the City is uniquely positioned financially due to our adherence to prudent fiscal policies and practices over the past several years. Since March 2020, when the COVID-19 crisis first emerged in Cambridge, the City has developed, implemented, and monitored our public health strategies to slow the spread of the virus. The City has provided almost $25 million in direct financial and community support to our most vulnerable residents during the Pandemic. This support -- funded through various City, community and federal funding sources -- has been distributed to the Housing Stabilization Program, small business community, non-profit community, arts sector, various homeless support programs, and Cambridge Public Schools. In addition, the City has also appropriated $10.5 million through the Coronavirus Relief Fund received as part of the Federal Cares Act to the State of Massachusetts and allocated to cities and towns. Funds have been used towards staff overtime costs related to COVID-19 testing sites and other projects; personal protective equipment; services and supports to Cambridge residents; meals for the homeless program; and activities and supports related to homeless services. The City has set up a COVID-19 Federal Emergency Management Agency (\u201cFEMA\u201d) grant project. The City has spent approximately $18 million to date on COVID-19 related expenses, and a portion of which the City anticipates will be reimbursed by FEMA. Our efforts are possible in part because of strong City management, sound fiscal policies set by the City Council, and a strong financial position that allows us to strategically use free cash reserves to support our COVID-19 pandemic response. Over the past year, we have demonstrated our ability to provide essential city services while also supporting COVID-19 related services and programs. Additionally, despite the Pandemic's impacts, the City has remained committed to expanding support for important community initiatives, including affordable housing, homelessness initiatives, infrastructure improvements and maintenance, equity and diversity efforts, and supporting the small business community. Achieving this credit rating allows the City to finance important projects throughout Cambridge at the most favorable interest rate, which results in property tax savings to our taxpayers and increased financial flexibility, which has proven to be critical over the past year. These ratings are in conjunction with the City\u2019s sale of $84.7 million in General Obligation bonds as well as a refinancing of $21.3 million of existing debt. It should be noted that refinancing of this existing debt is anticipated to result in significant savings to the City over the next several years. The competitive sale will take place on March 3, 2021. Capital projects funded in this bond issuance include DPW facilities repairs; street and sidewalk reconstruction; fire station renovations (River street and Lexington Avenue); River Street reconstruction; City Hall improvements; Tobin Montessori and Vassal Lane Upper School construction; school improvement projects; sewer reconstruction; and the Harvard Square Kiosk. The refinanced debt was originally issued in 2010 and 2011 for the CRLS renovation, and 5 Western Avenue improvements (former Police Station). The rating agencies highlighted the City\u2019s strong financial position; a large, stable, and diverse tax base; ample excess levy capacity under Proposition 2 \u00bd; budgetary flexibility; and a strong and experienced management team. While our priorities over the past year have primarily focused on addressing impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic, we have been required to carefully manage and monitor our revenue and expenditures. This has become more complex during the Pandemic. However, we have still continued to address ongoing city needs, basic services, and many key initiatives. As demonstrated in the following highlights from rating agencies, the City\u2019s ability to maintain healthy reserves and budget flexibility and fiscal management are considered strengths. Additionally, the agencies highlight the City\u2019s prudent approach to developing expenditure and revenue projections has served the City well and will need to continue in FY22. As part of this year\u2019s documents for the bond sale, the City was required to provide a COVID-19 disclosure statement that describes the budgetary impact of COVID-19 on the current year operations and actions taken to address budgetary issues. As you recall, in the fall when the City Council was required to take necessary tax classification votes in order to set the FY21 tax rate through the Department of Revenue, reductions were made to non-property tax revenues, such as: Hotel/Motel, Meals Excise, departmental revenues and State Aid. However, this included offsetting increases in revenues from the Debt and Health Claims Stabilization Funds, Free Cash, Building Permits, other revenue adjustments and the use of one-time Agency funds. Additionally, adjustments included the recission of $5 million from the General Fund Employee Benefits Budget to reflect estimated salary and fringe benefit savings based on vacant positions that would not be filled quickly, mainly due to the current COVID-19 related capacity restrictions. The above demonstrates our ability, working with the City Council, to manage our resources and to make necessary adjustments. The consistent recognition from the rating agencies reflects strong City Council fiscal policies and should be a source pride for the City. Additionally, I would like to thank the City\u2019s Finance Team and Department Heads and staff for their commitment to managing their expenditures, revenues, operating and capital budgets, and programs in the face of unprecedented challenges. Listed below are highlights from the Moody\u2019s, Standard & Poor\u2019s, and Fitch credit reports. Attached are the individual rating opinions. Moody\u2019s Investors Services Summary Cambridge (Aaa stable) benefits from a large and diverse tax base that continues to experience strong growth. The city's economy is driven by the presence of Harvard University (Aaa stable) and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT, Aaa stable) and the impressive research and development sector. Cambridge's financial position is strong with very healthy reserves and liquidity that are maintained by formal policies and conservative fiscal management. Both the debt burden and long-term liabilities for pension and OPEB are conservatively managed and are expected to remain manageable. Credit strengths \u00b7 Large tax base anchored by institutional presence and robust commercial sector \u00b7 Healthy financial position guided by formal policies and strong fiscal management \u00b7 Ample operating flexibility with excess levy capacity under Proposition 2\u00bd \u00b7 Low adjusted net pension liability that will decline further given annual pension contributions above the tread water metric Credit challenges \u00b7 High regional cost of living and cost of business \u00b7 Taxpayer concentration in research and development Rating outlook The stable outlook reflects the city\u2019s strong fiscal management that is committed to maintaining a healthy financial position given conservative multi-year budget forecasting and adherence to formally adopted fiscal policies. The outlook also incorporates the stabilizing presence of Harvard University and MIT as well as the long historical trend of positive valuation growth in the tax base. Factors that could lead to a downgrade \u00b7 Material growth in the debt burden or unfunded long-term liabilities \u00b7 Significant deterioration in the tax base or weakening of the local economy \u00b7 Trend of operating deficits that lead to significant reduction in cash and reserves Environmental, Social, Government and Management (ESG) Considerations Environmental Environmental risks are not material to the city's credit profile at this time. Moody's affiliate Four Twenty Seven indicates that Middlesex County in which the city resides has high exposure to hurricanes, medium exposure to extreme rainfall, water stress and sea level rise and low exposure to heat stress. The city is committed to addressing environmental risk associated with flooding and heat exposure. To date, the most comprehensive mitigation projects include improving natural barriers around the Alewife neighborhood as well as heat mitigation efforts through its urban canopy-public shade tree investment program. Longer term the city expects to release its Climate Change Preparedness and Resilience Plan by the end of calendar year 2021. The plan will include a net zero action plan for government, residential and commercial development. The plan was scheduled to be released in 2020 but has been delayed due to challenges related to the coronavirus pandemic. Social Cambridge leverages its strong credit profile by focusing on significant community initiatives. These initiatives currently include a robust bike ordinance, participatory budgeting that gives residents a voice in capital and other spending, the city providing a proportional share of funding towards the MBTA green line extension and offering a small business personal property tax exemption. Additionally, the city continues to increase its funding towards affordable housing projects. In fiscal 2020 a supplemental appropriation of $15 million was used to preserve 338 affordable housing units. In fiscal 2021 the city committed $12.3 million of Community Preservation Act funding and $15 million from the capital budget to the Affordable Housing Trust to finance the creation and preservation of new affordable housing. Governance The city's experienced management team is very strong, as evidenced by the maintenance of very healthy liquidity and reserves as well as adherence to formal fiscal policies, conservative multiyear budgeting and capital planning. Financial operations and reserves: healthy financial position is expected to remain due to conservative budgeting and robust revenue growth The city's financial position will likely remain strong over the near term given ample liquidity, robust revenue growth and operating flexibility under the tax levy limit that are maintained by conservative fiscal management. The fiscal 2020 audited financials reflect the first year of declines in general fund reserves in many years due to transfers out to cover capital projects. S&P Global Credit Overview Cambridge is an affluent suburb immediately adjacent to Boston. Home to both Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the city is at the epicenter of biotech, pharmaceutical, and other knowledge-based sectors, which continue to generate growth in the tax base. It faces challenges in addressing housing, transportation, and other infrastructure needs. However, it has a history of significant forward-looking financial planning and a track record of consistently outperforming the budget. We expect Cambridge to remain a desirable location to live and work, sustaining economic growth that will assist management in meeting future challenges. Despite a drawdown in reserves in fiscal 2020, which may continue into subsequent years as the city works to balance its tax rate, balance sheet, and capital needs, we believe it will maintain balanced long-term financial performance and significant budgetary flexibility, given its high reserve levels and unused levy capacity. The economic climate may continue to pressure certain nontax revenues, but we do not expect to revise the rating over the next two years. The long-term rating reflects our view of the following factors: \u00b7 Very strong economy, with access to a broad and diverse metropolitan statistical area (MSA); \u00b7 Very strong management, with strong financial policies and practices under our Financial Management Assessment (FMA) methodology; \u00b7 Adequate budgetary performance, with operating results that we expect could improve in the near term relative to fiscal 2020, which closed with an operating deficit in the general fund but an operating surplus at the total governmental fund level in fiscal 2020; \u00b7 Very strong budgetary flexibility, with an available fund balance in fiscal 2020 of 43% of operating expenditures, and the flexibility to raise additional revenues despite statewide tax caps; \u00b7 Very strong liquidity, with total government available cash at 54.2% of total governmental fund expenditures and 5.6x governmental debt service, and access to external liquidity we consider strong; \u00b7 Adequate debt and contingent liability position, with debt service carrying charges at 9.7% of expenditures and net direct debt that is 60.6% of total governmental fund revenue, as well as low overall net debt at less than 3% of market value and rapid amortization, with 83.3% of debt scheduled to be retired in 10 years, but a large pension and other postemployment benefit (OPEB) obligation; and \u00b7 Strong institutional framework score. Environmental, social, and governance factors The rating incorporates our view regarding the health and safety risks posed by the COVID-19 Pandemic. Absent the implications of COVID-19, we consider the city's social risks in line with those of the sector. While not directly on the Atlantic Ocean, we believe Cambridge is vulnerable to environmental risks, including rising water levels from climate change that could directly affect taxable properties. The city has a history of proactively addressing future challenges, and, to this end, management maintains long-term plans to improve environmental resiliency. We analyzed Cambridge's governance risks relative to its economy, management, financial measures, and debt and liability profile, and determined that all are in line with our view of the sector standard. Very strong economy We consider Cambridge's economy very strong. The city, with a population of 114,686, is in Middlesex County in the Boston-Cambridge-Newton MSA, which we consider to be broad and diverse. It has a projected per capita effective buying income of 169% of the national level and per capita market value of $525,216. Overall, market value grew by 9.6% over the past year to $60.2 billion in 2021. We expect Cambridge to continue to see growth in its tax base and believe its wealth and income metrics will remain stable. Very strong management We view the city's management as very strong, with strong financial policies and practices under our FMA methodology, indicating financial practices are strong, well embedded, and likely sustainable. The city's annual budget development process supports its overarching goals, which include significant investments in its education system, housing, transportation network, and other quality-of-life issues, while maintaining fiscal balance. Active management of discretionary spending and ongoing monitoring of intrayear spending ensure adherence to the adopted budget. Budget-to-actuals and investments are reported quarterly to the finance and investment committees, respectively. Management uses historical trend analysis to develop line-item and departmental expenditure and revenue assumptions. Very strong budgetary flexibility Cambridge's budgetary flexibility is very strong, in our view, with an available fund balance in fiscal 2020 of 43% of operating expenditures, or $321.7 million. We expect the available fund balance to remain above 30% of expenditures for the current and next fiscal years, which we view as a positive credit factor, along with the city's flexibility to raise additional revenues despite statewide tax caps. We expect budgetary flexibility to remain very strong, given the city's existing reserves and significant flexibility under the levy limit. We include the budget-stabilization fund in our calculations, which the city accounts for in committed general fund reserves. We do not anticipate a material change in available reserves, despite increased use of reserves in the current fiscal year. We also believe the city has significant flexibility under the state levy cap. It currently has $187 million in unused levy capacity, about 25% of the adopted 2021 operating budget expenditures. Fitch Ratings The City\u2019s \u2018AAA\u2019 GO bond rating and IDR reflect Fitch\u2019s expectation for Cambridge to maintain a high level of financial flexibility through economic cycles, consistent with a history of strong operating performance and budget controls. The rating further reflects the City\u2019s wealthy resource base and future potential for continued tax base increases, along with moderate expenditure growth and demonstrated ability to reduce expenditures during economic downturns. Fitch expects long-term liabilities to remain low based on the city\u2019s capital needs, very rapid pace of principal amortization, continued growth in economic resources and a practice of fully funding actuarially determined pension contributions. Key rating drivers Revenue Framework: 'aaa' Revenues are derived primarily from property taxes and total annual general fund revenue growth over the past 10 fiscal years has exceeded both U.S.GDP and CPI for the same period, reflective of strong growth in Cambridge's economy and tax base. Pandemic related declines in revenues and property values are likely to slow growth in the near term but prospects remain strong for future advancement. The city maintains significant excess levy capacity under the state's Proposition 2 1/2 law, providing for a high legal ability to raise revenues. Expenditure Framework: 'aa' The natural pace of spending growth is expected by Fitch to be in line with to below natural revenue growth over time. Carrying costs for debt and retiree benefits claim a moderate proportion of governmental spending. Fitch expects carrying costs to remain moderate even with future debt issuances and annual increases in other-post employment benefit {OPEB) and pension contributions. The city maintains strong legal control over headcount and other key employment terms as provided by state statute. Long-Term Liability Burden:'aaa' Cambridge's direct debt, net of water and sewer debt paid from user charges, and Fitch\u00ad adjusted net pension liabilities {NPL) are low at approximately 6% of residents' personal income. Fitch anticipates Cambridge's long-term liability burden will remain in line with the 'aaa' assessment based on expected growth in the city's population and personal income, future debt plans, and a rapid pace of principal amortization. OPEB liabilities compared to personal income are high, but management is actively managing these costs. Operating Performance:'aaa' Careful expenditure management combined with moderate tax levy increases that have aligned with tax base changes and conservative financial forecasting have led to the maintenance of considerable reserves over the past decade. Fitch expects the city will continue to demonstrate a high level of financial resilience and gap-closing ability throughout the current and future economic cycles Rating Sensitivities Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade: \u00b7 Failure to implement available policy measures that offset risks associated with a return to economic contraction consistent with Fitch's coronavirus downside scenario, resulting in an erosion of the city's gap-closing capacity; \u00b7 Although not expected, a significant decline in taxable assessed values leading to substantial diminishment of the city's excess banked levy capacity. Operating Performance Fitch expects the city to maintain a high level of financial resilience throughout the current and future economic cycles given its historically strong revenue performance, conservative budgeting practices and superior degree of inherent budget flexibility. The steady growth in revenues has supported surplus operations over the past several fiscal years and the city has built up its reserves to high levels, supporting its high level of financial flexibility. During times of economic weakness, management has controlled spending and staffing levels to offset reductions in revenues and Fitch expects management will continue this practice during the current slowdown. The city's strong budget monitoring practices and financial planning bolster the city's operating environment.",

      "full_text": "ORDINANCE 2021-6: A Zoning Petition Has been received from Beals Associates Inc. regarding Broad Canal Subdistrict Zoning Petition as submitted with strike outs. # 13.40 PUD-3 AND PUD 3A DISTRICTS: DEVELOPMENT CONTROLS Unless otherwise indicated in this Section 13.40, the following provisions apply equally to all PUD-3 districts. Where standards or other requirements applicable to development with the PUD-3 District pursuant to this Section 13.40 conflict with any other provision of the Zoning Ordinance, the provisions of Section 13.40 shall apply. 13.41 Purpose. The PUD-3 districts are intended to provide for the creation of a high quality general and technical office environment which permits larger scale development and supporting commercial activities and which encourages strong linkages between new development at Kendall Square and along the East Cambridge riverfront. The PUD 3A District specifically is intended to permit larger scale development along the Binney Street corridor, consistent with the scale of development permitted in the abutting PUD-3 District, which also creates large areas of contiguous Public Open Space in the PUD 3A district or in adjacent PUD Districts in order to create a better transition from neighborhoods to commercial areas. As required by Section 13.48 and 13.59, any Final Development Plan for a Development Parcel in a PUD-3A District containing increased density and heights as described in Sections 13.43.1(2) and 13.44.4 shall minimize noise from rooftop mechanical equipment; contain environmentally sustainable buildings; promote pedestrian usage of the sidewalks, an improved pedestrian environment, pedestrian connections to public transit, and a sense of neighborhood continuity by providing an interesting, lively, and active presence at street level, by requiring a mix of residential, retail, and other uses as part of the Final Development Plan and by providing attractive exterior through-block connector space; provide parking which is primarily located underground and is maintained at lower ratios than customarily required by the Zoning Ordinance, so as to eliminate surface parking lots and promote public transportation and other parking and traffic demand measures which will reduce automobile trips; be consistent with the Eastern Cambridge Design Guidelines dated October 15, 2001; and preserve certain existing structures which add to the character of the neighborhood. Any such Final Development Plan encompassing land area in excess of 10 acres is expected to be constructed over a lengthy period of time of up to 20 years. By meeting these requirements and providing large areas of contiguous Public Open Space, a Final Development Plan in the PUD 3A district meeting these requirements will promote the goals of the Eastern Cambridge Planning Study dated October 2001 and the public health, safety, and welfare. ## 13.41.1 Establishment and Scope of Subdistricts within the PUD-3 District. The PUD-3 District may be divided into Subdistricts as described below for the purpose of defining requirements that may not apply to the District as a whole. All provisions of the PUD-3 shall apply equally to each Subdistrict, except as provided for elsewhere in Section 13.40. 13.41.2 Description of the Subdistricts within the PUD-3 District. 13.41.2.1 The Board Canal Subdistrict is the area bounded by the point in the centerline of Third Street that is consistent with the point of intersection that the northern sideline of Lot #36 on Assessor\u2019s Map 14 would have with said centerline if said northern sideline were continued in a straight line to said centerline, then easterly by the northern boundary of said parcel and the northern boundary of the Broad Canal to the western sideline of Edwin H Land Boulevard, then running south across the canal and along the eastern sideline of Lot #23 on Assessor\u2019s Map 13 to the centerline of the MBTA Right of Way, then westerly to a point in the centerline of the MBTA Right of Way that is consistent with the point of intersection that the western sideline of Lot #26 on Assessor\u2019s Map 14 would have with said centerline if said western sideline were continued in a straight line to said centerline, then north along said western sideline and the western sideline of Lot #36 on Assessor\u2019s Map 14, then running west along the southern sideline of said Lot #36 to the centerline of Third Street, then running north along said centerline. 13.42 Uses Allowed in the PUD-3 Districts. The uses listed in this Section 13.42, alone or in combination with each other, shall be allowed upon permission of the Planning Board.

All uses listed in sections 4.32 and 4.33 and which are allowed or conditionally allowed in the base zoning district. 13.42.3 Institutional Uses. All clinic uses permitted by Section 4.33(d). 13.42.4 Office and Laboratory Uses. All uses listed in Section 4.34. 13.42.5 Retail Business and Consumer Service Establishments.

(7) Bowling alley, skating rink, tennis center or other commercial recreation establishments. 13.42.6 Other Uses. Any use not listed in subsections 13.42.1 - 13.42.5 shall be allowed only upon written determination by the Planning Board that such use is consistent with the objectives of the PUD-3 district and is necessary to support the predominant uses in the district. Certain additional uses may be permitted in the PUD-3A district as set forth in Section 13.59. 13.42.7 \u201cPerforming Arts Center\u201d means one or more buildings on the same or adjacent lots used exclusively for the production, creation, performing, presentment, screening, development or viewing of at least three distinct forms of theatrical, musical, cinematic, dance, oratorical and other performing arts, to be viewed or experienced in at least three distinct venues within such building or buildings, together with such uses customarily accessory thereto, such as, but not limited to, stage, backstage, rehearsal or practice, classroom, storage, mechanical, dressing room, green room, lobby shop and/or store, ticketing, restaurant and/or lounge, and accessory office uses. 13.42.8 In the Broad Canal Subdistrict, \u201cCanal Uses\u201d, which mean a use that by design requires or is intended to have direct access to the Broad Canal due to its location adjacent to or on the Broad Canal or which location enhances the use or the activation of the Broad Canal, including but not limited to floating restaurants (including sale of alcohol), open air place of entertainment, kayak or similar rentals and launch, marinas, boat basins or other commercial or recreational boating facilities, public walkways, facilities for fishing, waterborne transportation facilities, shall be allowed only upon written determination by the Planning Board that such use is consistent with the objectives of the Broad Canal Subdistrict. 13.43 District Dimensional Regulations. 13.43.1 (1) PUD-3 District: The maximum ratio of floor area to the total area of the Development Parcel shall be 3.0 for Residential Uses, 4.31 a-h, and Dormitory Uses, Section 4.33 b (7), and 2.0 for all other permitted uses. A portion or portions of the existing or former Broad Canal without reference to ownership may be counted in calculating the area of the Development Parcel. Each portion so counted shall be included in computing the development parcel area for one planned unit development. (2) PUD-3A District: The maximum ratio of floor area to total area of the Development Parcel shall be 1.25 except that the Planning Board may approve a Final Development Plan with a maximum FAR exceeding 1.25 but not to exceed a maximum FAR of 3.0 where the Final Development Plan meets the requirements of Section 13.59. Pursuant to Sections 13.59.4 and 13.59.9, certain building areas may be excluded from Gross Floor Area for purposes of calculating such FAR. (3) Broad Canal Subdistrict: Notwithstanding Section 13.43.1(1) above, the Permitted Gross Floor Area (GFA) in the Board Canal Subdistrict shall be a maximum of one million, four hundred thousand (1,400,000) square feet of GFA, given the area of the parcel exceeds 80,000 square feet. 13.43.1.1 Notwithstanding any other provision of the Zoning Ordinance, including the definition of Gross Floor Area in Article 2.000, the Gross Floor Area of a Performing Arts Center in the PUD-3 District shall include only publicly accessible, above grade, circulation, performance, and amenity spaces as measured from the interior face of walls of each space provided that all other dimensional requirements, limitation on the permitted number of seats, or other requirements imposed under a PUD-3 District Special Permit, as amended, have been found by the Planning Board to have been satisfied. 13.43.2 The minimum size of the Development Parcel for a PUD shall be two (2) acres. A Development Parcel within the PUD-3 may contain noncontiguous lots elsewhere in this PUD district or within adjacent PUD districts. A Development Parcel within the PUD-3A District may contain noncontiguous lots elsewhere in one or more of the PUD-3A District, the PUD-4C District and, solely for the purpose of including lots to be dedicated to Public Open Space, the PUD-2 District subject to the provisions of Section 13.59. There shall be no specified minimum lot size for lots located within a Development Parcel. Planning Board approval of all proposed lots located within a Development Parcel shall be required. 13.43.3 For the purpose of computing residential density, the minimum lot size for each dwelling unit shall be three hundred (300) square feet. Residential density shall be computed based on the entire Development Parcel. 13.43.4 There shall be no minimum width for the Development Parcel and no minimum width for lots located within the Development Parcel. There shall be no other minimum required front, rear and side yard requirements for a Development Parcel or for lots located within a Development Parcel. The Planning Board shall approve all such building setbacks. Any buildings on a parcel abutting the Broad Canal should be set back or so designed as to provide a pedestrian pathway along the canal\u2019s edge. 13.43.4.1 In a PUD-3A District, there shall be a setback of ten (10) feet from the streetline of Binney Street at and above a point between 78 and 85 feet above grade (the exact location of such point to be determined by the Planning Board in its review of the Development Proposal and Final Development Plan). Up to one-third of fa\u00e7ade length on a cumulative basis may be exempted from this requirement. 13.44 Height. 13.44.1 In the PUD-3 District the maximum height of any building shall be two hundred and thirty (230) feet, except as modified in Section 13.44.2. 13.44.2 In the PUD-3 District the Planning Board shall not approve any Final Development Plan in which twenty-five (25) percent or more of the land area of the Development Parcel is covered with such buildings or parts of buildings not exempted by Section 5.23 in excess of one hundred and twenty (120) feet in height or in which fifteen (15) percent or more of the land areas of the Development Parcel is covered with such buildings or parts thereof in excess of two hundred (200) feet in height. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Planning Board, in its discretion, may accept for review an application for a Special Permit based on a Development Proposal which deviates from the aforesaid provisions of this Section 13.44.2, provided that the Final Development Plan is in conformity with such provisions. Except as allowed by Section 13.44.21 below, lower buildings or building elements are encouraged closer to the Charles River while taller buildings or building elements are encouraged closer to Kendall Square. 13.44.2.1 In the Broad Canal Subdistrict, no more than one building shall be allowed to exceed two hundred fifty (250) feet in height. In reviewing a Development Proposal or Final Development Plan including a building that exceeds two hundred fifty (250) feet in height, the Planning Board shall give consideration to a building that is designed to be a distinctive architectural landmark. In no event shall any building having a height in excess of three hundred fifty (350) feet be permitted. 13.44.3 In the PUD-3 District, in evaluating a Development Proposal providing building height in excess of one hundred and twenty (120) feet, the Planning Board shall give consideration to evidence presented on the following: (a) that increased height will not cast shadows or alter air currents in ways that will unreasonably limit the amount of light and air reaching other buildings in the vicinity to a significantly greater extent that if the building height did not exceed one hundred and twenty (120) feet; (b) that increased height would mitigate detrimental environmental impacts such as excessive ground coverage, diminution of open space, and monotonous development; (c) that increased height would not adversely affect and would result in increased sensitivity to the visual and physical characteristic of the particular location through more harmonious relationships to the terrain and to the proposed and existing buildings in the vicinity that have functional or visual relationships to the proposed building; (d) that increased height would result from actions taken to lessen the impact of traffic and parking on the surrounding area; and (e) that the orientation and location of the proposed structure would not otherwise diminish the health and safety of the area around the development parcel. 13.44.4 In the PUD-3A District, the maximum height of any building shall be one hundred twenty (120) feet, except that the Planning Board may approve a Final Development Plan with a building height within the PUD-3A District of one hundred forty (140) feet subject to the requirements of Section 13.59. 13.45 Open Space. The minimum ratio of open space to the total area of the Development Parcel as defined in Article 2.000 and Section 5.22 shall be fifteen (15) percent except as modified below. 13.45.1 As part of a Special Permit for a PUD, the Planning Board may reduce the open space requirement if the development is located adjacent to a Public Open Space and if the development is physically and functionally integrated with the Public Open Space by means of building orientation, location of building entrances, pedestrian linkages between major activity centers, or similar factors, or if the development provides for contiguous Public Open Space as described in Section 13.59. 13.45.2 Open space shall include parks, plazas, landscaped areas open to the sky, playgrounds, balconies, roofs developed for recreational or leisure usage, and pedestrian ways such as bridges, decks, arcades, loggias, and gallerias as specified by the Planning Board. 13.46 Perimeter and transition. Any part of the perimeter of a PUD which fronts on an existing street or Public Open Space should be so designed as to complement and harmonize with adjacent land uses with respect to scale, density, setback, bulk, height, landscaping, and screening. Development in the PUD-3 districts should provide integrated pedestrian circulation systems, particularly strong linkages between the riverfront and Kendall Square. Development in the PUD-3A District should enhance the pedestrian experience along Binney Street. See Section 13.59.3 13.47 Parking and Loading Requirements. Development in the PUD-3 district shall conform to the off street Parking and Loading Requirements set forth in Article 6.000, except as modified by this Section 13.47. In the PUD-3A district these provisions shall be further modified by Section 13.59 for any development subject to the provisions of Section 13.59. 13.47.1 Off street parking facilities shall be provided as follows: (1) Residence: Minimum number of spaces per group of dwelling units: 10 per 10. (2) Public Assembly: Number of Seats requiring one space: 15. 13.47.2 Institutional, Retail and Office: Number of Square Feet of Gross Area Requiring One Space: (1) Institutional: 1,800 square feet (2) Retail and Office: Ground Floor: 900 square feet Other level: 1,800 square feet. 13.47.3 Notwithstanding Sections 13.47.1 and 13.47.2, development in the Broad Canal Subdistrict shall conform to the off street Parking and Loading Requirements set forth in Article 6.000, except as modified by this Section 13.47.3 as follows: (1) Maximum Parking. Maximum allowed parking for a PUD in the Broad Canal Subdistrict shall be limited by applying the rates set forth below to each use within the PUD and taking the summation of the result for all uses. Exceeding the maximum allowed parking shall require a waiver from the Planning Board of maximum parking required under the general provisions of Article 6.000. (2) Maximum of 0.9 spaces per 1,000 square feet of Gross Floor Area for office uses, excluding technical office (Section 4.34(a-e)). (3) Maximum of 0.8 spaces per 1,000 square feet of Gross Floor Area for laboratory use and technical office uses (Section 4.34(f)). (4) Maximum of 0.75 spaces per residential dwelling unit (Section 4.31(d-g)). (5) Maximum of 0.5 spaces per 1,000 square feet of retail (Sections 4.35 and 4.36). (6) Maximum of 1 space per 4 sleeping rooms for hotel use (Section 4.31(i)(2)). 13.47.4 The parking requirements of this Section 13.47, and as modified in Section 13.59 for development subject to the provisions of Section 13.59, may be satisfied anywhere on the Development Parcel, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Article 6.000. 13.47.5 The Planning Board, in its approval of a Final Development Plan in the Broad Canal Subdistrict for a Development Parcel, may waive any requirements for the amount, location and design of parking or loading facilities within a Development Parcel, and may permit loading facilities to be shared across various uses and lots within the PUD-3 District. 13.48 Where indicated in this Section 13.40, the provisions of Section 13.59 shall apply equally in the PUD-3A District. The Planning Board shall include in any Special Permit conditions that require ongoing compliance with any and all applicable provisions of Section 13.59. 4555979.3",

(8) Housing Plan - providing the approximate number and mix of housing unit types proposed on each residential site; (9) Phasing Plan - describing the general sequence and timeline for the detailed design and construction of all major project elements, including buildings, landscaping, streets, and utilities, and the completion or conveyance of any public infrastructure or property interests; (10) Sustainability Plan - describing: (i) how the sustainability requirements set forth in Section 22.20 will be met; (ii) expected greenhouse gas emissions from the development and strategies employed to improve energy efficiency and support renewable energy production through individual building design and by utilizing existing or new district-wide energy systems, with reference to the recommendations of the City\u2019s Net Zero Action Plan; and (iii) expected vulnerability of the development to the effects of climate change, including increased precipitation, flood risk, temperature, and urban heat island effect, and strategies to promote resiliency within individual building sites and within the Master Plan as a whole, including natural stormwater management systems, increased vegetation and shade, and measures to withstand and recover from extreme climatological events, with reference to the recommendations of the City\u2019s relevant Climate Change Preparedness and Resilience planning documents; (11) Transportation Plan - incorporating: (i) a Transportation Impact Study required by Section 19.20; (ii) a Shared Parking Study that identifies opportunities for reducing the total amount of parking required to serve all uses through the sharing of parking spaces by multiple uses;

and (13) Architectural Character Plan - describing general approaches to the design of buildings, landscaped areas, streets, and pathways, identifying the type of visual character that the development will aim to achieve, with the expectation that specific designs of individual buildings and spaces will be reviewed in further detail as they are developed. 20.930.3 Master Plan Approval. The Planning Board may grant a Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Special Permit, incorporating any approved special permits for the Development Parcel, subject to the following provisions: (a) Criteria. In addition to the general special permit criteria set forth in Section 10.43, the Project Review Special Permit criteria set forth in Section 19.25, and all other criteria applicable to the special permits being sought, the Planning Board shall find that the following criteria are met when granting a Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Special Permit: (1) The Master Plan is in substantial conformance with the vision, goals, and recommendations set forth in the Alewife District Plan, including any amendments to the Alewife District Plan or future City planning reports that address the Alewife District, including but not limited to the topics of land use, open space, urban form, mobility, climate and environment, housing, economy, and zoning, and with any urban design guidelines published by the City pursuant to the Alewife District Plan or any amendments thereto or future planning reports that address the Alewife District; (2) The Master Plan is in substantial conformance with applicable standards for flood and heat resilience recommended through the City\u2019s Climate Change Preparedness and Resilience planning efforts or future climate change planning efforts; and (3) The Master Plan will result in the completion of a publicly accessible connection for bicyclists and pedestrians, at a minimum, across the railroad right of way between the Triangle District and the Quadrangle Northwest District, with conditions incorporated into the project phasing that will ensure its completion. A connection that accommodates passenger shuttles is desirable. (4) Housing - The revised zoning requires that a development proposal must be in general conformance with the Alewife District Plan, which would include land use. The Alewife District Plan calls for residential use west of the extension of Spinelli Place, which is about 40-50% of the anticipated development area. If desired, the Council could add provisions in the \u201cCriteria for Approval\u201d section such as a minimum amount or percentage of residential use, and/or requirements for phasing. An approach used in past mixed-use developments has been to require the residential phase to commence before 60% of permitted commercial uses are built, and to complete the residential phase before or concurrently with the completion of commercial uses. Within these constraints, a timing and phasing plan for the development would be subject to review and approval by the Planning Board. (5) Parking - This is also part of the required conformance with the Alewife District Plan as included in the revised text. As in other areas of redevelopment, the Alewife District Plan anticipates that parking would be used flexibly to serve uses throughout the area at different times while minimizing the number of parking spaces provided. Minimum parking ratios by use would be eliminated except for a smaller minimum for housing to mitigate possible impacts on public street parking, and maximum parking ratios by use would be established as follows: a. Retail: maximum 1.5 per 1,000 SF b. Office: maximum 1.1 per 1,000 SF c. R&D: maximum 0.8 per 1,000 SF d. Industrial: maximum 0.5 per 1,000 SF e. Residential: maximum 0.75 per dwelling unit, minimum .25 per dwelling unit (b) Conditions. The Quadrangle Northwest District Master Plan Special Permit shall set forth conditions to ensure that the applicable criteria are met, including but not limited to the following conditions: (1) Approved land uses and dimensional characteristics of the Master Plan at an aggregate level and for individual building sites; (2) Required public improvements and other benefits such as infrastructure and open space; (3) Required measures to mitigate development impacts, including but not limited to transportation impacts and construction activity; (4) Procedures for review and approval of the designs of individual buildings, open spaces, public improvements, and other components of the Master Plan; and (5) Timing and phasing for completion of the different components of the Master Plan, including but not limited to required public improvements, benefits, and mitigation. (c) Commencement. The commencement of construction of any single building approved in a Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Special Permit shall constitute exercise of the special permit for purposes of M.G.L. Chapter 40A and Section 10.46 of this Zoning Ordinance. The timing of completion shall be set forth by the Planning Board in the conditions of the special permit, which timing may be extended by the Planning Board upon a showing of good cause, and shall be subject to other conditions related to timing and phasing set forth in the special permit conditions. (d) Amendments. A Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Special Permit may identify specific modifications to the Master Plan that may be subject to future approval by a written determination of the Planning Board. Otherwise, the Planning Board shall determine whether a proposed modification is a Major Amendment or Minor Amendment according to the standards set forth in Sections 12.37.1 through 12.37.3 of this Zoning Ordinance. 20.930.4 Modifications to Standards. Except as otherwise set forth herein, any project receiving a Quadrangle Northwest District Master Plan Special Permit shall comply with all other applicable development standards set forth in this Zoning Ordinance. The following modifications may be authorized by the Planning Board upon granting a Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Special Permit: (1) The Additional FAR provisions of Paragraph (1) of Section 20.95.11 of this Zoning Ordinance may be applied to a Quadrangle Northwest Development Parcel in its entirety if the proposed development incorporates construction of a publicly accessible pedestrian and bicycle bridge connection across the railroad right of way between the Quadrangle Northwest District and the Triangle District or incorporation of structural elements into a building's design that includes or would permit future construction of such a pedestrian connection (that are acceptable to the City for that purpose), as well as the conveyance (in a form acceptable to the City) of the necessary fee or easement property interests in land that would permit access to such a connection, in a manner and to an extent determined to be sufficient to significantly advance the objectives of the Alewife District Plan . (2) The height of any building, regardless of use, may be increased to a maximum of eighty-five (85) feet, but shall remain subject to the limitations of Section 20.95.2, Paragraph 1(a) within 100 feet or 200 feet of a residential or Open Space district, provided the Planning Board finds that the entire leasable ground story of any non-residential building (excluding entrances/exits, lobbies, circulation, utilities, loading, and other functions necessary to serve upper-story uses or the building as a whole) is planned, designed, and constructed for the occupancy of light industrial uses and/or businesses that require light industrial space but also include a consumer- facing or community-focused component as described in the Economy Recommendations of the Alewife District Plan, with floor-to-ceiling heights that the Board finds to be suitable for such uses. The Planning Board may approve a limited number of Retail and Consumer Service Establishments to provide neighborhood amenities if they do not collectively occupy more than twenty percent (20%) of any building\u2019s total Ground Story and the Board finds that they do not detract from the emphasis on light industrial spaces as described in the Alewife District Plan. A residential building, which may include above-grade structured parking that is located to the rear of and visually screened from the street by principal-use residential space, may also be increased to a maximum of eight-five (85) feet without being required to meet the other requirements of this Paragraph. (3) If the Planning Board finds that the ground story of any building requires elevation above the existing mean grade in order to conform to flood resilience standards as established by the City, then the maximum height of any building may be further increased by not more than four (4) feet or the difference between the ground story finished floor elevation and the existing mean grade, whichever is lesser. To make such finding, the Planning Board shall have received and reviewed a written report from the City Engineer describing flood resilience standards applicable and the impact of those standards to the development site. (4) Spaces within the ground story of any non-residential building that are reserved for light industrial uses or businesses that require light industrial space but also include a consumer-facing or community-focused component as described in the Economy Recommendations of the Alewife District Plan may be excluded from the calculation of Gross Floor Area for the purpose of applying the limitations and requirements of this Zoning Ordinance, provided that the dimensions of such spaces, their permitted range of approved uses, and other conditions to ensure that the intent of the Alewife District Plan is met shall be set forth in writing by the Planning Board in the Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Special Permit. (5) Applicable minimum parking requirements shall be waived, and the Planning Board shall set forth maximum limitations and other conditions pertaining to the development and operation of off-street parking facilities in accordance with the Mobility Recommendations of the Alewife District Plan. (6) Applicable yard requirements and limitations, with the exception of requirements for yards abutting a residential or Open Space district as set forth in Paragraph (2) of Section 20.95.31 of this Zoning Ordinance, shall be modified to the extent necessary to conform to the recommended building setbacks and street sections recommended in the Urban Form and Mobility Recommendations of the Alewife District Plan, as approved by the Planning Board.",

CAMBRIDGE CITY COUNCIL - REGULAR COUNCIL MEETING: March 1, 2021 COVID-19 UPDATE QUESTIONS VICE MAYOR MALLON: 1. The CHA announced yesterday that they would not be receiving any new doses of vaccines. How will that impact the announced CHA vaccine site in Somerville (next to Target) from last week's meeting? 2. There seems to be an uptick in CPS staff COVID cases, from 53 on 2/21 to 59 on 2/22 which seem to be clustered at the FMA. What is being done to contain this uptick among staff at FMA? 3. Please give an update on vaccinations for our low-income elderly population through the onsite program with CHA. How many have been vaccinated, how many are left, what is the plan to finish vaccinating this vulnerable group? COUNCILLOR NOLAN: 1. From a public health perspective, a number of people have expressed concern about the impact of the pandemic on routine health care. Covid-19 meant the availability of routine health screenings and visits declined the past year - due to people either staying away from doctor\u2019s offices or not being able to schedule in person visits. Did Cambridge residents experience this - or was telehealth able to fill in adequately? For our most vulnerable populations, is there anything the public health department is doing or can be doing to ensure that the pandemic related challenges in getting routine health care does not have long-term adverse effects? 2. What is the status of applications for funds available for residents and businesses suffering from the economic impact of the pandemic - residents unable to pay rent or mortgages, businesses, or organizations at risk of closure. Have we seen the need for more funds to be allocated or have the efforts to date met most of the most urgent needs, from what we can tell? MAYOR SIDDIQUI: 1. What is the efficacy of the vaccines on the new COVID-19 variants? Can you share some information on the Johnson & Johnson vaccine? 2. Do we have any information on boosters being developed to address variants that emerge? 3. How has our messaging changed around masking changed? Should everyone be double masking? COUNCILLOR SIMMONS: 1. We learned that the Cambridge Housing Authority was able to help vaccinate seniors right inside their senior buildings, bringing the vaccines to them instead of forcing the seniors to drive to vaccination centers - how will we find and reach other home bound seniors (such as those in 1221 Cambridge Street and other non-CHA buildings) who do not have the ability to go to public vaccination sites? 2. As more vaccine doses become available in the coming weeks and months, what long-term plans does the Cambridge Public Health Department have to vaccinate all our seniors and those with mobility issues?",

Sina was a smart and hardworking 16-year-old student, who made a lasting impact on her teachers, classmates, and all who knew her. The Cambridge community is mourning the loss of this young life and my thoughts are with her family during this painful time. It is important for us to check in on each other and acknowledge pain as a community. Cambridge is a close community of individuals who are here for one another and we have to show compassion and hold each other in this moment. This year has been so difficult, especially for our youth, and it is imperative that we are able to create a space where everyone feels safe to reach out to a trusted adult and talk through any feelings of loss, grief, mental health struggles, or suicidal thoughts.

This building is designed to use 44% less energy than a typical school building and exemplifies our City\u2019s commitment to going green. A group of Cambridge School Committee members, educators, and community partners came together in late 2020 to create the Cambridge Collective and answer the question: \u201cHow can we provide young people opportunities to be with one another and caring adults?\u201d. From their conversations, \u201cDown with Design\u201d was born\u2014a series of safe, outdoor, social opportunities for high school students designed by CRLS students in 10th and 11th grade, to be held on the last Sunday of each month through June. On Sunday January 17th, \u201cDown with Design\u201d brought 22 CRLS students to Starlight Square where the young designers provided music, journaling stations, a collaborative art project, and discussion/reflection prompts, both at Starlight and during a walk around Sennott Park.

The Planning Board may grant a Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Special Permit, incorporating any approved special permits for the Development Parcel, subject to the following provisions: (a) Criteria. In addition to the general special permit criteria set forth in Section 10.43, the Project Review Special Permit criteria set forth in Section 19.25, and all other criteria applicable to the special permits being sought, the Planning Board shall find that the following criteria are met when granting a Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Special Permit: (1) The Master Plan is in substantial conformance with the vision, goals, and recommendations set forth in the Alewife District Plan, including any amendments to the Alewife District Plan or future City planning reports that address the Alewife District, including but not limited to the topics of land use, open space, urban form, mobility, climate and environment, housing, economy, and zoning, and with any urban design guidelines published by the City pursuant to the Alewife District Plan or any amendments thereto or future planning reports that address the Alewife District; (2) The Master Plan is in substantial conformance with applicable standards for flood and heat resilience recommended through the City\u2019s Climate Change Preparedness and Resilience planning efforts or future climate change planning efforts; and (3) The Master Plan will result in the completion of a publicly accessible connection for bicyclists and pedestrians, at a minimum, across the railroad right of way between the Triangle District and the Quadrangle Northwest District, with conditions incorporated into the project phasing that will ensure its completion. A connection that accommodates passenger shuttles is desirable. (4) Housing - The revised zoning requires that a development proposal must be in general conformance with the Alewife District Plan, which would include land use. The Alewife District Plan calls for residential use west of the extension of Spinelli Place, which is about 40-50% of the anticipated development area. If desired, the Council could add provisions in the \u201cCriteria for Approval\u201d section such as a minimum amount or percentage of residential use, and/or requirements for phasing. An approach used in past mixed-use developments has been to require the residential phase to commence before 60% of permitted commercial uses are built, and to complete the residential phase before or concurrently with the completion of commercial uses. Within these constraints, a timing and phasing plan for the development would be subject to review and approval by the Planning Board. (5) Parking - This is also part of the required conformance with the Alewife District Plan as included in the revised text. As in other areas of redevelopment, the Alewife District Plan anticipates that parking would be used flexibly to serve uses throughout the area at different times while minimizing the number of parking spaces provided. Minimum parking ratios by use would be eliminated except for a smaller minimum for housing to mitigate possible impacts on public street parking, and maximum parking ratios by use would be established as follows: a. Retail: maximum 1.5 per 1,000 SF b. Office: maximum 1.1 per 1,000 SF c. R&D: maximum 0.8 per 1,000 SF d. Industrial: maximum 0.5 per 1,000 SF e. Residential: maximum 0.75 per dwelling unit, minimum .25 per dwelling unit (b) Conditions. The Quadrangle Northwest District Master Plan Special Permit shall set forth conditions to ensure that the applicable criteria are met, including but not limited to the following conditions: (1) Approved land uses and dimensional characteristics of the Master Plan at an aggregate level and for individual building sites; (2) Required public improvements and other benefits such as infrastructure and open space; (3) Required measures to mitigate development impacts, including but not limited to transportation impacts and construction activity; (4) Procedures for review and approval of the designs of individual buildings, open spaces, public improvements, and other components of the Master Plan; and (5) Timing and phasing for completion of the different components of the Master Plan, including but not limited to required public improvements, benefits, and mitigation. (c) Commencement. The commencement of construction of any single building approved in a Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Special Permit shall constitute exercise of the special permit for purposes of M.G.L. Chapter 40A and Section 10.46 of this Zoning Ordinance. The timing of completion shall be set forth by the Planning Board in the conditions of the special permit, which timing may be extended by the Planning Board upon a showing of good cause, and shall be subject to other conditions related to timing and phasing set forth in the special permit conditions. (d) Amendments. A Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Special Permit may identify specific modifications to the Master Plan that may be subject to future approval by a written determination of the Planning Board. Otherwise, the Planning Board shall determine whether a proposed modification is a Major Amendment or Minor Amendment according to the standards set forth in Sections 12.37.1 through 12.37.3 of this Zoning Ordinance. 20.930.4 Modifications to Standards. Except as otherwise set forth herein, any project receiving a Quadrangle Northwest District Master Plan Special Permit shall comply with all other applicable development standards set forth in this Zoning Ordinance. The following modifications may be authorized by the Planning Board upon granting a Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Special Permit: (1) The Additional FAR provisions of Paragraph (1) of Section 20.95.11 of this Zoning Ordinance may be applied to a Quadrangle Northwest Development Parcel in its entirety if the proposed development incorporates construction of a publicly accessible pedestrian and bicycle bridge connection across the railroad right of way between the Quadrangle Northwest District and the Triangle District or incorporation of structural elements into a building's design that includes or would permit future construction of such a pedestrian connection (that are acceptable to the City for that purpose), as well as the conveyance (in a form acceptable to the City) of the necessary fee or easement property interests in land that would permit access to such a connection, in a manner and to an extent determined to be sufficient to significantly advance the objectives of the Alewife District Plan . (2) The height of any building, regardless of use, may be increased to a maximum of eighty-five (85) feet, but shall remain subject to the limitations of Section 20.95.2, Paragraph 1(a) within 100 feet or 200 feet of a residential or Open Space district, provided the Planning Board finds that the entire leasable ground story of any non-residential building (excluding entrances/exits, lobbies, circulation, utilities, loading, and other functions necessary to serve upper-story uses or the building as a whole) is planned, designed, and constructed for the occupancy of light industrial uses and/or businesses that require light industrial space but also include a consumer- facing or community-focused component as described in the Economy Recommendations of the Alewife District Plan, with floor-to-ceiling heights that the Board finds to be suitable for such uses. The Planning Board may approve a limited number of Retail and Consumer Service Establishments to provide neighborhood amenities if they do not collectively occupy more than twenty percent (20%) of any building\u2019s total Ground Story and the Board finds that they do not detract from the emphasis on light industrial spaces as described in the Alewife District Plan. A residential building, which may include above-grade structured parking that is located to the rear of and visually screened from the street by principal-use residential space, may also be increased to a maximum of eight-five (85) feet without being required to meet the other requirements of this Paragraph. (3) If the Planning Board finds that the ground story of any building requires elevation above the existing mean grade in order to conform to flood resilience standards as established by the City, then the maximum height of any building may be further increased by not more than four (4) feet or the difference between the ground story finished floor elevation and the existing mean grade, whichever is lesser. To make such finding, the Planning Board shall have received and reviewed a written report from the City Engineer describing flood resilience standards applicable and the impact of those standards to the development site. (4) Spaces within the ground story of any non-residential building that are reserved for light industrial uses or businesses that require light industrial space but also include a consumer-facing or community-focused component as described in the Economy Recommendations of the Alewife District Plan may be excluded from the calculation of Gross Floor Area for the purpose of applying the limitations and requirements of this Zoning Ordinance, provided that the dimensions of such spaces, their permitted range of approved uses, and other conditions to ensure that the intent of the Alewife District Plan is met shall be set forth in writing by the Planning Board in the Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Special Permit. (5) Applicable minimum parking requirements shall be waived, and the Planning Board shall set forth maximum limitations and other conditions pertaining to the development and operation of off-street parking facilities in accordance with the Mobility Recommendations of the Alewife District Plan. (6) Applicable yard requirements and limitations, with the exception of requirements for yards abutting a residential or Open Space district as set forth in Paragraph (2) of Section 20.95.31 of this Zoning Ordinance, shall be modified to the extent necessary to conform to the recommended building setbacks and street sections recommended in the Urban Form and Mobility Recommendations of the Alewife District Plan, as approved by the Planning Board.",

I am writing to submit the attached Zoning Petition which amends Article 8.000 of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance. The Law Department, along with the Community Development Department and Inspectional Services Department, have prepared this Petition to amend the Zoning Ordinance in order to comply with G.L. c.40A, \u00a76. A recent case from the Supreme Judicial Court (the \u201cSJC\u201d) has interpreted G.L. c.40A, \u00a76 to provide special protections to lawful preexisting nonconforming single and two-family dwellings. Bellalta v. Zoning Board of Appeals of Brookline, 481 Mass. 372 (2019). Specifically, the SJC held that if an alteration or addition to a lawful preexisting nonconforming single and two- family dwelling increases an existing dimensional nonconformity, but does not create any new dimensional nonconformities, the property owner is only required to obtain a special permit for the alteration or addition, and not a variance. This holding is limited to lawful preexisting nonconforming single and two-family dwellings. This holding is also in conflict with Article 8.000 of the Zoning Ordinance because presently in certain instances the Zoning Ordinance requires that a property owner obtain a variance for alterations or additions to a lawful preexisting nonconforming single and two-family dwelling, even where no new nonconformities are created. As an example, if a single or two-family dwelling is lawfully preexisting nonconforming because it exceeds the allowable Floor Area Ratio (\u201cFAR\u201d) and the property owner has planned an addition that will further exceed the FAR but not create a new nonconformity, by law the Zoning Ordinance cannot require the property owner to obtain a variance to allow the addition. Rather, that addition requires the grant of a special permit and finding that the proposed additional will not be substantially more detrimental than the existing preexisting nonconforming structure to the neighborhood. This Petition is necessary to bring the Zoning Ordinance into conformance with the SJC\u2019s interpretation of G.L. c.40A, \u00a76. The Law Department, Community Development Department and Inspectional Services Department will be available to discuss this Petition with you and with the Planning Board throughout the zoning amendment process.",

DePasquale, City Manager, relative to the appropriation of $1,000,000 from the Community Benefits Stabilization Fund to the Grant Fund Human Services Other Ordinary Maintenance for the purpose of entering into grant agreements with nonprofit organizations to provide services to vulnerable residents during the COVID-19 emergency and recovery. I am hereby requesting the appropriation of $1,000,000 from the Community Benefits Stabilization Fund to the Grant Fund Human Services Other Ordinary Maintenance for the purpose of entering into grant agreements with nonprofit organizations to provide services to vulnerable residents during the COVID 19 emergency and recovery. The City Council previously approved my request for an appropriation of $1 million dollars from the Community Benefits Stabilization Fund for this purpose on May 18, 2020. Those funds were awarded to 106 community-based organizations based on recommendations from the Community Benefits Advisory Committee. Based on the continuing needs related to the COVID-19 pandemic and the capacity of Cambridge\u2019s not for profit community to address those needs, I am recommending the appropriation of the additional $1 million dollars. Pursuant to Chapter 2.127 of the Cambridge Municipal Code, the Community Benefits Advisory Committee (CBAC) is charged with soliciting and evaluating applications for the use of community benefits funds from community-based organizations based on priorities established by the City Council. The City Council voted on a broad set of priorities when it adopted the 2017 Community Needs Assessment, which can be viewed at <https://www.cambridgema.gov/CDD/News/2-17/communityneedsassessmentreport>. The Needs Assessment is very comprehensive and continues to provide important, broad guidance. That needs assessment was considered by CBAC in designing the simple application and speedy decision-making process by which the $1 million dollars was allocated last summer. Our nonprofit community provides basic needs and other critical supports for low-income, under-resourced, and vulnerable families and individuals at risk. The Cambridge Nonprofit Coalition has surveyed the nonprofit community twice and heard about both the deep needs of our residents as well the increased financial stress of the not for profits even as many of them have received a variety of different grants through the City or other funders. The use of Community Benefits Funds through grant agreements with nonprofit organizations will provide additional COVID-19 related assistance and critical supports to both the nonprofit organizations and to our residents impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. If this appropriation is approved, CBAC will proceed with a process closely following the successful process by which the earlier $1 million was awarded in grants. The City Council should be proud of the assistance the City has been able to provide to its residents, small businesses and nonprofits through the Mayor's Disaster Relief Fund, the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority, federal Community Development Block Grant and CARES funding, the Housing Stabilization Fund and the Community Benefits Fund.",

Funds were received from contributions to the East Cambridge Open Space Fund and will be used to fund the design and construction of three new parks in the East Cambridge/Kendall Square area; Timothy J. Toomey, Jr. Park, Triangle Park and Binney Street Park. I am hereby requesting the appropriation of $5,717,250 from the Mitigation Stabilization Fund to the Public Investment Fund Department of Public Works Extraordinary Expenditures account. Funds were received from contributions to the East Cambridge Open Space Fund. These funds are dedicated for open space purposes in the East Cambridge area per an agreement with Alexandria Real Estate Equities <https://www.cambridgema.gov/~/media/Files/CDD/ZoningDevel/CommitmentLetters/commit_alexandria_ord1319.pdf> outlining the commitment of these funds. These funds, in combination with previous contributions from Alexandria Real Estate Equities ($9,500,000) and Boston Properties Inc. ($2,000,000), will be used to fund the design and construction of three new parks in the East Cambridge/Kendall Square area; Timothy J. Toomey, Jr. Park, Triangle Park and Binney Street Park. Use of Funds: \u00b7 Construction of the Timothy J. Toomey, Jr. Park (formerly Rogers Street Park) is currently underway and is expected to be completed by fall 2021. This new 2.2-acre neighborhood park includes play areas, sand and water play, a new permanent dog run, and picnic seating areas and benches around the park. The project also includes a park maintenance storage area that will facilitate the use of green park maintenance equipment in the East Cambridge area. \u00b7 Construction at the 2/3-acre Triangle Park is anticipated to begin in spring 2021 and be completed by late 2022. The proposed design has been updated to emphasize tree plantings and canopy growth <https://www.cambridgema.gov/-/media/Files/CDD/ParksandOpenSpace/ParkProjects/EasternCambridge/Triangle_RevisionTwoPager_20200811_WEB.pdf> in an area of the city that has relatively less canopy coverage, in accordance with the recommendations of the Urban Forest Master Planning process, while retaining the passive quality that was the intent of the original park design. Nearly 400 new trees will be planted, creating an urban grove of trees to provide high quality natural shade over movable seating and furniture. \u00b7 The 1-acre Binney Street Park is to be a future dog park and will include a portion of the Grand Junction Multi-Use Path. The design and construction documents for this project are substantially complete. The schedule for the construction of this project is being finalized, pending coordination with adjacent improvements on Binney Street and the routing of Eversource transmission lines in the area. This funding, in combination with previous appropriations, is anticipated to cover the design and construction of all 3 new parks, based on current project estimates. Those estimates were created by professional designers and include standard construction contingencies. However, if the bids come in higher than estimated, I anticipate coming back to the Council for an additional appropriation in order to complete these 3 critical new public open spaces in East Cambridge.",

      "full_text": "A communication transmitted from Louis A. DePasquale, City Manager, relative to Awaiting Report Item Number 19-75, regarding the feasibility of partnering with a local research institution to conduct a study that determines how many ridehail vehicles are on the roads during both on and off-peak times and their impacts on congestion and safety. In response to Awaiting Report 19-75, regarding the feasibility of partnering with a local research institution to conduct a study that determines how many ridehail vehicles are on the roads during both on and off-peak times and their impacts on congestion and safety, Director of Traffic, Parking, and Transportation Joseph Barr and Assistant City Manager for Community Development Iram Farooq report the following: Over the past few months, City staff have entered into initial discussions with research staff from the Department of Urban Studies and Planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, to explore the feasibility of obtaining more detailed data on trips made in ridehail vehicles (also known as Transportation Network Companies, or TNCs). Currently, the only information directly available to cities and towns is the total number of passenger pick- ups within each municipality in each calendar year, which is reported as part of the10\u00a2 per ride fee that is transferred to each municipality from the Department of Public Utilities (which is responsible for regulating TNCs in Massachusetts). Because the City does not have the authority to further regulate TNCs, access to any data beyond the aggregate yearly total of passenger pick ups would require voluntary participation on the part of the TNCs. Although the recently passed Transportation Bond Bill (H.5248-An Act Authorizing and Accelerating Transportation Investment) included language requiring additional detailed data reporting from TNCs, those sections were vetoed by the Governor and it is unclear if and when such requirements might be considered again in the future. As members of the City Council may be aware, the two principal TNCs that operate in Massachusetts are Uber and Lyft, and both have been reluctant to share detailed data about the pick-up and drop off locations of trips that are enabled by their applications, for both customer privacy and competitive reasons. This is particularly the case with government agencies, since the data would then be subject to a public records request, potentially leading to the disclosure of information that the TNCs consider confidential and/or proprietary. However, as the original policy order notes, there have been some cases in other locations where the TNCs have been willing to share data with private research institutions that are not subject to public records requests, who can then analyze and present data to government agencies in a form that can be released publicly without compromising private and/or sensitive information. Based on these successful examples, we have begun discussion with MIT researchers on this topic, since there are multiple faculty who have prior experience working with TNCs on research and data issues, although not in exactly the same manner as contemplated in this policy order. Based on these discussions, there are potential overall questions that could be explored if the TNCs were willing to provide access to additional data: \u00b7 More detailed information on pick up and drop off locations, including data that is stratified by time of the day, day of the week, or time of the year. In addition to helping the City understand where we may want to establish pick up and drop zones for TNCs, this could also help us understand the variability of demand and the locations where TNCs may be causing congestion. \u00b7 Information about TNCs operating without passengers, either when traveling to a pick-up or when they have completed a drop off and have not yet picked another trip. It\u2019s important to note that analyzing these so-called \u201cdeadhead\u201d trips can be complicated by the fact that many drivers operate for both TNCs, such that these trips can sometimes be double counted across both networks, or an active trip being made on one TNC might appear as deadhead time on the other TNC. \u00b7 Information about what percentage of TNC rides are shared, as well as details about the fares that are charged to customers. This information would be helpful in understanding current trends and future potential for ridesharing. Maximizing the number of trips that can be shared is an important goal for the City. Based on these initial discussions, the MIT research staff we have been talking to are working on drafting an initial data request letter to be sent to representatives of both Uber and Lyft, asking to initiate more detailed discussions regarding the potential to share data of various types and levels of detail. Working with MIT has the potential to create a partnership with researchers who are highly skilled in data analytics and will be able to analyze and synthesize the data to help us develop technical conclusions and policy recommendations. Based on discussions with regional partners, we also believe that there is the potential to successfully apply for grants for this project, to support the technical research that MIT staff and students would be performing. Although we are not assured of success in developing this data sharing partnership, we believe that it is an effort worth pursuing. We will continue to keep the City Council updated on the progress that we make, both in setting up the data sharing and analysis partnership, and in the results of the analysis. We are also interested to learn more about any specific questions that the Council may be interested in answering with this data, and the types of policy initiatives that you may be interested in pursuing, as these will help guide both the data that we request and the analyses that we pursue.",

      "full_text": "A Zoning Petition Has been received from Cambridge Redevelopment Authority regarding a Zoning Ordinance to reflect the proposed changes to the KSURP. Petition Language: To amend Article 14 of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT: KENDALL CENTER Introduction: When Eversource announced its plans for a new electrical substation on Fulkerson Street, the City Manager asked City and CRA staff, as well as representatives from the local development community, to explore an alternative site for the facility. After the numerous hearings held by City Council regarding the substation proposal, Boston Properties (BXP) approached the City and CRA about the idea of placing the substation on the site of the existing \u201cBlue Garage\u201d within the MXD District of the Kendall Square Urban Renewal Project Area. Although this alternate site is highly preferred to the Fulkerson Street location, there are nonetheless many complex technical challenges associated with relocating the substation to this parcel. It involves not only the design of the substation and high voltage access routes to the location, but also completing plans for the housing program currently outlined in the Infill Development Concept Plan, fulfilling interim and future parking requirements, and designing locations for additional development to provide financial support for this alternative location. The CRA hereby submits this zoning petition to amend the Article 14 of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance: MXD Development District: Kendall Center in order to accommodate the relocation of the Eversource substation to the BXP site. Corresponding changes will also be required to the Kendall Square Urban Renewal Plan. These changes would affirm the regional utility infrastructure land use in the district, as well as provide for additional development rights and make adjustments to some dimensional restrictions to facilitate the alternative site. 1. Replace the current Subsection 14.21.7(6) with the following text: 14.21.7(6) Transformer station, substation, gas regulator station, or pumping station and related utility uses. 2. Replace first three paragraphs of current Subsection 14.32.1 with the text below: 14.32.1 The Aggregate gross floor area (GFA) of development in the District shall not exceed the sum of (i) four million, four hundred seventy three thousand (4,473,000) square feet, plus (ii) six hundred thousand (600,000) square feet that shall be limited to multi-family residential uses as permitted in Section 14.21.4(1), for a total Aggregate GFA not to exceed five million, seventy three thousand (5,073,000) square feet. Up to sixty thousand (60,000) square feet of such Aggregate GFA of four million, four hundred seventy-three thousand (4,473,000) in clause (i) of the preceding sentence, shall be allowable only by special permit pursuant to Section 14.72. At least two hundred thousand (200,000) square feet of the GFA restricted to housing uses shall occur only within the area designated on the Zoning Map as the \u201cAmes Street District\u201d and has been approved by special permit dated March 27,2015 (the \u201cAmes Street Residential Project\u201d). Additionally, a building permit for construction of a residential project of at least four hundred thousand (400,000) square feet shall be issued prior to or concurrently with the issuance of a building permit for any project utilizing Utility Project GFA (as defined in Section 14.32.2 below). The design review process for a residential project of at least four hundred thousand (400,000) square feet shall also precede, or proceed concurrently with, the design review process for any project utilizing Utility Project GFA, in accordance with a special permit approving a Concept Plan as set forth in Section 14.32.2 below. 3\\. Add the following paragraph to the end of Subsection 14.32.2: Any additional Infill GFA for commercial uses that is not the subject of the existing Concept Plan approved by Special Permit PB #315 on March 20, 2017 (as amended by Amendment #1 (Major) dated January 31, 2019) (collectively, the \u201cExisting Concept Plan\u201d) may only be utilized in conjunction with the development by NSTAR Electric Company d/b/a Eversource (or its successors and assigns) of a substation within the District (\u201cthe Substation Project\u201d) and only on property within the District owned by the entity (or an affiliate thereof) that provided the land on which the Substation Project is to be developed. For the purposes of this Article, the eight hundred thousand (800,000) square feet of Infill GFA for commercial uses that is not the subject of the Existing Concept Plan may sometimes be referred to as \u201cUtility Project GFA\u201d. The issuance of a building permit for the Substation Project shall precede or be issued concurrently with the issuance of a building permit for any project utilizing Utility Project GFA. The MXD District is expected to achieve high standards for urban design, architectural design, environmental sustainability and open space design, and to transform the area into a recognizable center of activity and civic life for Kendall Square and the surrounding neighborhoods. The District should create open space to serve residents in the area, as well as workers, students from nearby institutions, and visitors. It should promote permeability at the edges of the District, and create public spaces that will feel welcoming and comfortable for all users. 4. Replace current Subsection 14.32.2.1(8) and 14.32.2.1(9) with the following text: 14.32.2.1 Infill Development Concept Plan Requirements: 8) A plan describing street, public infrastructure, and utility improvements to be undertaken in coordination with the development program, including all proposed water, stormwater and sewage facilities, and (in conjunction with the Substation Project) the general location of the proposed substation, which shall also be submitted to the Department of Public Works for review. 9) A plan illustrating proposed building scale, height and massing, including a model and a study demonstrating the anticipated shadow and wind impacts of all proposed buildings taller than 100 feet, and a general description of proposed mitigation measures that will be employed. Additionally the plan will include a narrative describing the plan\u2019s compatibility, coordination and consistency with the urban design guidelines set forth in the Kendall Square Final Report of the K2C2 Planning Study (\u201cK2 Guidelines\u201d) the Volpe Working Group\u2019s Planning & Design Principles dated July 20, 2017 (the \u201cVolpe Guidelines\u201d) and the planning principles referenced in Section 14.32.2. 5. Replace current Subsection 14.32.2.2 with the following text: 14.32.2.2 Findings and Approval. The Planning Board shall grant a special permit approving a Concept Plan upon finding that the new development identified within the plan meets the criteria for approval of a Planned Unit Development set forth in Section 12.35.3(3) of the Zoning Ordinance and the criteria for approval of a Project Review Special Permit set forth in Section 19.25 of the Zoning Ordinance. In making its findings, the Board shall consider the objectives set forth in the K2 Guidelines and the Volpe Guidelines. The approval of a Concept Plan shall serve to meet any applicable project review requirements of Article 19.000, and no additional Project Review Special Permit shall be required for new development that is identified within an approved Concept Plan. In addition, while the location of the Substation Project is to be shown on a Concept Plan, the actual development of the Substation Project shall not be included within the scope of a special permit approving a Concept Plan (but shall remain subject to all applicable regulations governing the construction of such projects). 6. Add the following new Subsection 14.32.5(d) at the end of Subsection 14.32.5: d) Inapplicability to Utility Project GFA. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 14.32.5. there shall be no Innovation Space requirement for any project utilizing Utility Project GFA (nor shall any such project utilizing Utility Project GFA be entitled to utilize Innovation Space in order to obtain a GFA Exemption under Section 14.32.6(3) below). 7\\. Replace current Subsection 14.32.6(2) and 14.32.6(3) with the following text: 2) Outdoor Area Exemptions: Private outdoor decks or balconies for multi- family residential or commercial development, up to eight percent (8%) of the building floor area. 3) Innovation Space: Innovation Space GFA up to the lesser of either twenty percent (20%) of the Infill GFA dedicated to Office and Biotechnology Manufacturing Uses or one hundred five thousand (105,000) square feet. In order for the Innovation Space GFA to be exempt from the Aggregate GFA limitations, at least twenty five percent (25%) of the Innovation Space utilization (measured by square footage or shared space membership) must be set aside as below market rate space to be offered by the CRA or the City to qualifying tenants for short-term leases consistent with Section 14.32.5(b). 8. Add the following new Subsections 14.32.6(7) and 14.32.6(8) at the end of Subsection 14.32.6: 7) Electrical Substation: The Substation Project shall be exempt from Aggregate GFA calculation as well as the requirements as to Floor Area Ratio. Further, substation construction shall not constitute Infill GFA (or Utility Project GFA). 8) Educational Lab, Classroom or Training Facility: Up to twenty thousand (20,000) square feet of educational, health or workforce training facilities operated to provide services to the general public (as opposed to private facilities that are solely accessible by tenants or occupants of commercial buildings within the District), which such services are either permitted as of right within the District in accordance with the provisions of this Article 14 or may otherwise be permitted by special permit. 9. Add the following new paragraph at the end of Section 14.33: Notwithstanding the provisions of the immediately preceding paragraph, there shall be no maximum floor area ratio for any project utilizing Infill GFA (including Utility Project GFA). However, the District Development Limitations in Section 14.32 shall continue to apply. 10. Replace first paragraph of Section 14.34 with the following text: 14.34 Building Height Limitation. The maximum building height in the District shall be two hundred and fifty (250) feet. Notwithstanding the foregoing, one building within the District may reach four hundred (400) feet provided, however, that the occupied floors above two hundred and fifty feet (250) feet may only contain residential and associated amenity space. Additionally, the floorplate of any portion of a building above two hundred fifty (250) feet shall not exceed twelve thousand five hundred (12,500) square feet. 11. Replace current Section 14.38 with the following text: 14.38 Active Ground Floors. The ground floor of newly constructed buildings utilizing fifty thousand (50,000) square feet or more of Infill GFA, where that ground floor fronts onto Main Street, Broadway or Ames Street, must be occupied by (i) Retail and Consumer Service uses, as listed in Section 14.21.3, or (ii) active public gathering space (whether enclosed or open), along a minimum length of seventy-five percent (75%) of the building fa\u00e7ade along this frontage; provided, however, that the requirement shall be forty percent (40%) for any building with a fa\u00e7ade length of one hundred (100) feet or less along such frontage onto Main Street, Broadway or Ames Street. Dimensional variations and alternate uses may be approved by the Planning Board upon determining that the specific uses and designs proposed are consistent with the purpose and intent of this Section 14.38. Alternatively, if a Concept Plan provides for the redevelopment of existing buildings to include new Retail and Consumer Service uses along the ground floor of any of the identified street frontages, then the Planning Board may permit a reduction in the required length of active street frontage for new buildings for up to fifty percent (50%) of the length of new active street frontage provided in existing buildings and only if the Board finds that it results in a better outcome for the District as a whole. Banks and financial institutions shall not be considered active ground floor uses for the purposes of meeting this requirement. 12. Replace current Section 14.39 with the following text: 14.39 Letter of Commitment. It is acknowledged and agreed that the Letter of Commitment dated December 21, 2015 by Boston Properties Limited Partnership is hereby replaced by the Letter of Commitment dated January 28, 2021 by the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority. As such, the Letter of Commitment dated December 21, 2015 by Boston Properties is declared null and void and of no further force or effect, and shall no longer be binding upon Boston Properties Limited Partnership or its successors and assigns. 13. Replace the first paragraph of Subsection 14.52.2 with the following text: 14.52.2 With the exception of multi-family residential development, there are no minimum parking requirements for new development in the District. Residential development shall provide at a minimum 0.25 automobile parking spaces per dwelling unit. All proposed development shall be restricted from constructing parking spaces, either on or off the lot within the District, beyond the maximum allowances of Table 1. If a development includes more than one category of use, then the number of spaces allowed for the development shall be the sum of the allowance for each category of use. Where the computation of required spaces results in a fractional number, only a fraction of one half or more shall be counted as one. The Planning Board may approve arrangements for shared parking of such residential parking spaces with commercial spaces or otherwise adjust the minimum parking requirements based on review and analysis of anticipated parking demand within the Transportation Impact Study. 14. Replace current Subsection 14.52.3 with the following text: 14.52.3 The parking allowances specified in Table 1 may be satisfied by a lease agreement between the developer and the City, other public entity, or private consortium for use of parking spaces in a public or pooled private parking facility located within the District (or, in the case of the spaces required for residential uses, located outside of the District but within one thousand (1,000) feet of the residential building for which the parking is being provided, measured from property edge to property edge), provided that on a temporary basis, spaces required for residential uses may be within two thousand (2,000) feet of the residential building while permanent residential parking is being constructed. The total number of parking spaces leased and constructed within the district for development on a lot shall not exceed the maximum allowances provided for in Table 2. 15. Replace current Subsection 14.52.6 with the following text: 14.52.6 Bicycle Parking: Bike parking shall be provided as set forth in Section 6.100 of this Zoning Ordinance; provided that in issuing a special permit approving a Concept Plan, the Planning Board may determine that the bicycle parking requirements for individual buildings shown on the Concept Plan may be met utilizing a campus planning approach toward bicycle parking. 14.52.6.1 Intent: To allow flexibility within the high-density environment of the MXD District while providing high quality, equitable, and thoughtfully planned bicycle parking and sustainable transportation amenities for all users, consistent with Section 6.108.2. Given the complexity of infrastructure requirements of the Substation Project, the bicycle parking provisions set forth in Section 6.100 is infeasible, and a comprehensive bicycle parking plan will be needed to help to balance space constraints and competing uses on or near the ground level. 14.52.6.2 Bike Parking Plan: The bicycle parking plan may utilize a combination of the following strategies, or other design provisions that meet the principles of Section 6.108.3: a) Public Bicycle Sharing Facilities: Where a new, standard-size Public Bicycle Sharing Station or larger is provided (i) on the lot, or (ii) on a site within five hundred (500) feet of the lot, with written approval of the City if located on a public street or other City Property, or otherwise by legally enforceable mutual agreement with the owner of the land on which the station is to be located. If Public Bicycle Sharing Station(s) are provided, each bicycle dock within that station may count for up to two (2) required bicycle parking spaces. Should it be deemed beneficial to the operation of a Public Bicycle Sharing system by the Community Development Department and the Public Bicycle Sharing system operator, a developer may meet additional bicycle parking requirements by providing a secure, accessible and geographically central location for the storage and/or maintenance of the publicly shared bicycles. If a Public Bicycle Sharing storage and/or maintenance facility is provided, each designated bicycle storage space shall count for up to one-half (0.5) of a required bicycle parking space b) Countercyclical Bicycle Parking Facility: As the District will contain residential and commercial uses having different peak parking demand times, multiple buildings may share parking facilities within three hundred (300) feet from each other. A shared bicycle parking space may count as a required bicycle parking space for both a residential use and a commercial use within separate buildings within a campus plan. c) Complementary Valet Bicycle Parking: Bicycle parking may be provided through a valet bicycle parking program that is offered free of charge to users. In order to utilize valet bicycle parking, a developer must submit for the Planning Board\u2019s approval a plan describing: i. The design of the valet bicycle parking facilities (which shall not be required to conform with the dimensional regulations of Section 6.100). ii. The proposed number of attendants, number of bicycle parking spaces provided, hours of valet service operations, and other pertinent information. When an approved valet bicycle parking program that was utilized to meet the requirements of Section 6.100 is discontinued, the property owner must either bring the bicycle parking spaces into full conformance with the bicycle parking requirements of Section 6.100 or seek approval from the Planning Board for an alternative approach. The combination of the strategies above, or other provisions accepted by the Planning Board, shall allow a project to adjust the minimum required number of bicycle parking spaces, as supported through analysis made available to the Planning Board.",

Woodson](https://www.naacp.org/naacp-history-carter-g-woodson/) and [Jesse E. Moorland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_E._Moorland) founded the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History (ASNLH), which was charged with researching and publicizing the achievements of Black Americans, and which sponsored [National Negro History Week](https://www.zinnedproject.org/news/tdih/carter-woodson-black-history- month/) during the second week of February in 1926; and WHEREAS: As important as this public recognition of the countless contributions made by African-American citizens to the United States was, it would frustratingly take another half century before President Gerald Ford would formally declare February to be recognized as Black History Month; and WHEREAS: In the ensuing decades, Black History Month has been designated as a time when communities all across the country make a point of recognizing, highlighting, and celebrating the achievements made by African-American citizens to our country, and to bring those individuals who had otherwise gone under- recognized and underappreciated out of the shadows and into the full mainstream of the American Story where they belong; and WHEREAS: The City of Cambridge has been the home of many groundbreaking African- American leaders and history makers over the past two centuries, including the likes of Maria Louise Baldwin, Clement G. Morgan, Saundra Graham, and countless others who have helped shape this amazing community; and WHEREAS: In 2021, with Kamala Harris having recently made history in becoming the very first woman, Black, South Asian person to be sworn in as Vice President, a brighter spotlight is shining upon all those, both locally and nationally, who helped pave the way for this tremendous achievement; and WHEREAS: While the people of Cambridge should be delving more deeply into all the parts of our history, including the contributions made by African-Americans, throughout the entire year, we should nevertheless make a concerted effort during Black History Month to shine a spotlight on the contributions to our shared story that were made by the African-American individuals who walked these paths before us; now therefore be it RESOLVED: That the City Council go on record recognizing February 2021 as Black History Month in the City of Cambridge, and that the City Council encourages residents across the community to delve into the many contributions that African- American citizens have made in Cambridge since this city\u2019s earliest days.",

WHEREAS: The Ordinance Committee voted to recommend that the City Council amend the petition to incorporate the proposed changes from the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority. Now therefore be ORDERED: That the KSURP zoning petition filed on September 17, 2020 is hereby amended by substitution with the following language: Petition Language: To amend Article 14 of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT: KENDALL CENTER KEY Language additions are underlined. Language deletions are shown with strikethrough text. Amended language is shown with bold and double underlined text. Introduction: When Eversource announced its plans for a new electrical substation on Fulkerson Street, the City Manager asked City and CRA staff, as well as representatives from the local development community, to explore an alternative site for the facility. After the numerous hearings held by City Council regarding the substation proposal, Boston Properties (BXP) approached the City and CRA about the idea of placing the substation on the site of the existing \u201cBlue Garage\u201d within the MXD District of the Kendall Square Urban Renewal Project Area. Although this alternate site is highly preferred to the Fulkerson Street location, there are nonetheless many complex technical challenges associated with relocating the substation to this parcel. It involves not only the design of the substation and high voltage access routes to the location, but also completing plans for the housing program currently outlined in the Infill Development Concept Plan, fulfilling interim and future parking requirements, and designing locations for additional development to provide financial support for this alternative location. The CRA hereby submits this zoning petition to amend the Article 14 of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance: MXD Development District: Kendall Center in order to accommodate the relocation of the Eversource substation to the BXP site. Corresponding changes will also be required to the Kendall Square Urban Renewal Plan. These changes would affirm the regional utility infrastructure land use in the district, as well as provide for additional development rights and make adjustments to some dimensional restrictions to facilitate the alternative site. 1. Replace the current Subsection 14.21.7(6) with the following text: 14.21.7(6) Transformer station, substation, gas regulator station, or pumping station and related utility uses designed primarily to serve development within the District. 2. Replace first three paragraphs of current Subsection 14.32.1 with the text below: 14.32.1 The Aggregate gross floor area (GFA) of development in the District shall not exceed the sum of (i) three million, six hundred seventy three thousand (3,673,000) four million, four hundred seventy three thousand (4,473,000) square feet, plus (ii) six hundred thousand (600,000) square feet that shall be limited to multi-family residential uses as permitted in Section 14.21.4(1), for a total Aggregate GFA not to exceed four million, two hundred seventy three thousand (4,273,000) five million, seventy three thousand (5,073,000) square feet. Up to sixty thousand (60,000) square feet of such Aggregate GFA of three million, six hundred seventy three thousand (3,673,000) four million, four hundred seventy three thousand (4,473,000) in clause (i) of the preceding sentence, shall be allowable only by special permit pursuant to Section 14.72. At least two hundred thousand (200,000) square feet of the GFA restricted to housing uses shall occur only within the area designated on the Zoning Map as the \u201cAmes Street District\u201d and has been approved by special permit dated March 27,2015 (the \u201cAmes Street Residential Project\u201d). The commencement of construction for the Ames Street Residential Project, approved by special permit in 2015, shall precede the occupancy of any commercial GFA in excess of three million and seventy-three thousand (3,073,000) square feet, other than the 60,000 square feet of commercial space that may be permitted by special permit pursuant to Section 14.72.3.

If a development includes more than one category of use, then the number of spaces allowed for the development shall be the sum of the allowance for each category of use. Where the computation of required spaces results in a fractional number, only a fraction of one half or more shall be counted as one. The Planning Board may approve arrangements for shared parking of such residential parking spaces with commercial spaces or otherwise adjust the minimum parking requirements based on review and analysis of anticipated parking demand within the Transportation Impact Study. 14. Replace current Subsection 14.52.3 with the following text: 14.52.3 The parking allowances specified in Table 1 may be satisfied by a lease agreement between the developer and the City, other public entity, or private consortium for use of parking spaces in a public or pooled private parking facility located within the District (or, in the case of the spaces required for residential uses, located outside of the District but within one thousand (1,000) two thousand (2,000) feet of the residential building for which the parking is being provided, measured from property edge to property edge), provided that on a temporary basis, spaces required for residential uses may be within two thousand (2,000) feet of the residential building while permanent residential parking is being constructed. The total number of parking spaces leased and constructed within the district for development on a lot shall not exceed the maximum allowances provided for in Table 2. 15. Replace current Subsection 14.52.6 with the following text: 14.52.6 Bicycle Parking: Bike parking shall be provided as set forth in Section 6.100 of this Zoning Ordinance; provided that in issuing a special permit approving a Concept Plan, the Planning Board may determine that the bicycle parking requirements for individual buildings shown on the Concept Plan may be met utilizing a campus planning approach toward bicycle parking. 14.52.6.1 Intent: To allow flexibility within the high-density environment of the MXD District while providing high quality, equitable, and thoughtfully planned bicycle parking and sustainable transportation amenities for all users, consistent with Section 6.108.2. Given the complexity of infrastructure requirements of the Substation Project, the bicycle parking provisions set forth in Section 6.100 is infeasible, and a comprehensive bicycle parking plan will be needed to help to balance space constraints and competing uses on or near the ground level. 14.52.6.2 Bike Parking Plan: The bicycle parking plan may utilize a combination of the following strategies, or other design provisions that meet the principles of Section 6.108.3: a) Public Bicycle Sharing Facilities: Where a new, standard-size Public Bicycle Sharing Station or larger is provided (i) on the lot, or (ii) on a site within five hundred (500) feet of the lot, with written approval of the City if located on a public street or other City Property, or otherwise by legally enforceable mutual agreement with the owner of the land on which the station is to be located. If Public Bicycle Sharing Station(s) are provided, each bicycle dock within that station may count for up to two (2) required bicycle parking spaces. Should it be deemed beneficial to the operation of a Public Bicycle Sharing system by the Community Development Department and the Public Bicycle Sharing system operator, a developer may meet additional bicycle parking requirements by providing a secure, accessible and geographically central location for the storage and/or maintenance of the publicly shared bicycles. If a Public Bicycle Sharing storage and/or maintenance facility is provided, each designated bicycle storage space shall count for up to one-half (0.5) of a required bicycle parking space b) Countercyclical Bicycle Parking Facility: As the District will contain residential and commercial uses having different peak parking demand times, multiple buildings may share parking facilities within three hundred (300) feet from each other. A shared bicycle parking space may count as a required bicycle parking space for both a residential use and a commercial use within separate buildings within a campus plan. c) Complementary Valet Bicycle Parking: Bicycle parking may be provided through a valet bicycle parking program that is offered free of charge to users. In order to utilize valet bicycle parking, a developer must submit for the Planning Board\u2019s approval a plan describing: i. The design of the valet bicycle parking facilities (which shall not be required to conform with the dimensional regulations of Section 6.100). ii. The proposed number of attendants, number of bicycle parking spaces provided, hours of valet service operations, and other pertinent information. When an approved valet bicycle parking program that was utilized to meet the requirements of Section 6.100 is discontinued, the property owner must either bring the bicycle parking spaces into full conformance with the bicycle parking requirements of Section 6.100 or seek approval from the Planning Board for an alternative approach. The combination of the strategies above, or other provisions accepted by the Planning Board, shall allow a project to adjust the minimum required number of bicycle parking spaces, as supported through analysis made available to the Planning Board.",

      "full_text": "A Zoning Petition Has been received from Cambridge Redevelopment Authority regarding a Zoning Ordinance to reflect the proposed changes to the KSURP. Petition Language: To amend Article 14 of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT: KENDALL CENTER Introduction: When Eversource announced its plans for a new electrical substation on Fulkerson Street, the City Manager asked City and CRA staff, as well as representatives from the local development community, to explore an alternative site for the facility. After the numerous hearings held by City Council regarding the substation proposal, Boston Properties (BXP) approached the City and CRA about the idea of placing the substation on the site of the existing \u201cBlue Garage\u201d within the MXD District of the Kendall Square Urban Renewal Project Area. Although this alternate site is highly preferred to the Fulkerson Street location, there are nonetheless many complex technical challenges associated with relocating the substation to this parcel. It involves not only the design of the substation and high voltage access routes to the location, but also completing plans for the housing program currently outlined in the Infill Development Concept Plan, fulfilling interim and future parking requirements, and designing locations for additional development to provide financial support for this alternative location. The CRA hereby submits this zoning petition to amend the Article 14 of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance: MXD Development District: Kendall Center in order to accommodate the relocation of the Eversource substation to the BXP site. Corresponding changes will also be required to the Kendall Square Urban Renewal Plan. These changes would affirm the regional utility infrastructure land use in the district, as well as provide for additional development rights and make adjustments to some dimensional restrictions to facilitate the alternative site. 1.

In order to utilize valet bicycle parking, a developer must submit for the Planning Board\u2019s approval a plan describing: i. The design of the valet bicycle parking facilities (which shall not be required to conform with the dimensional regulations of Section 6.100). ii. The proposed number of attendants, number of bicycle parking spaces provided, hours of valet service operations, and other pertinent information. When an approved valet bicycle parking program that was utilized to meet the requirements of Section 6.100 is discontinued, the property owner must either bring the bicycle parking spaces into full conformance with the bicycle parking requirements of Section 6.100 or seek approval from the Planning Board for an alternative approach. The combination of the strategies above, or other provisions accepted by the Planning Board, shall allow a project to adjust the minimum required number of bicycle parking spaces, as supported through analysis made available to the Planning Board.",

Having collaborated with CPHD to review the most recent COVID-19 data, CPSD has determined that we will be able to safely reopen school buildings for in-person learning. This decision to resume in-person learning is aligned with CPS\u2019s updated COVID-19 health and safety framework, which the School Committee adopted at the Regular Meeting on Tuesday, January 5th <https://www.cpsd.us/cms/One.aspx?portalId=3042869&pageId=69870497>. The new health and safety framework is based on the recommendations of the Schools and the Path to Zero: Strategies for Pandemic Resilience in the Face of High Community Spread <https://urldefense.com/v3/__http:/track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/gjeRQ_cWl7ylgYiW5WDxZA**A/AAAAAQA*/RgRh13WbP0T_aHR0cDovL3RyYWNrLnNwZS5zY2hvb2xtZXNzZW5nZXIuY29tL2YvYS9XMVZtY0dLTnJDbl8zbjh4SndEOWVRfn4vQUFBQUFRQX4vUmdSaDFQaElQMFJFYUhSMGNITTZMeTluYkc5aVlXeGxjR2xrWlcxcFkzTXViM0puTHpJd01qQXZNVEl2TVRndmMyTm9iMjlzY3kxaGJtUXRkR2hsTFhCaGRHZ3RkRzh0ZW1WeWJ5OVhCM05qYUc5dmJHMUNDbF9yeU1UelgyVTlWVUpTRzJOeWFYTjBhVzVBWld4c2FYTnpkSEpoZEdWbmFXVnpMbU52YlZnRUFBQUFBUX5-VwdzY2hvb2xtQgpf9htC9l8GuMqoUhRia2ltQGNhbWJyaWRnZW1hLmdvdlgEAAAAAQ**A__;fn5-fn4!!GolgDdAAPFHvrrz0!LjyNb6turVODWPKk2-wPAnoRk_KsOjktfti- EIb2VTEWy4I9E8_fstSWx7HM5oKXtBY$> report. Highlights of this framework include: \u00b7 CPS using the COVID-19 metrics to inform rather than decide when schools open/close-taking a more nuanced approach and considering every case on its own, based on who was exposed and how, to determine the proper course of action (View updated dashboard here <https://www.cpsd.us/cms/One.aspx?portalId=3042869&pageId=69798726>) \u00b7 Three-feet distancing in classrooms for scholars in grades PK-5 and 10-day quarantining upon exposure, as approved by the School Committee at the Special Meeting on December 22nd (see here <https://cpsd.us/cms/One.aspx?portalId=3042869&pageId=69860497> for more information) \u00b7 Expanding the surveillance testing program to include students in grades 6-12 and exploring options for testing younger students \u00b7 Strengthening communication and training of students, staff, and families on infection control procedures \u00b7 Developing school-level \u201cinfection control teams\u201d Prior to this vote, we heard testimonies on the subject of school reopening, from over 100 community members who came to Public Comment and we received emails from hundreds more. Thank you to everyone who has reached out to us. There is no perfect and risk-free solution out there, and everyone\u2019s concerns have been valid. At the end of the day, we all want the same thing: to provide the best education possible to our kids and getting our scholars and educators back in classrooms safely.

Here is his summary of the grade level plans: \u00b7 Preschool - Grades 3: We will continue the current model, using criteria to prioritize students for in-person learning seats, four days per week. The shift to 3-foot distancing will allow us to combine many currently split in- person classrooms, distribute support staff to support additional learners across the school, and possibly support more 2 - 3 grade students in-person. \u00b7 Grades 4 - 5: CPS will use the criteria to prioritize students for in-person learning seats, four days per week. Each school will implement this approach differently, depending on the staffing and enrollment scenario at each school. This may mean students may participate in mixed classrooms, where educators are supporting both in-person and remote learners or may be assigned to a new teacher and classroom. \u00b7 Grades 6 - 8: Students will be assigned to two cohorts, which will attend school in-person either Monday/Tuesday or Thursday/Friday. In the case of capacity limits due to staffing, students will be prioritized using district wide criteria. Students will be dismissed at lunch, with grab-and-go meals, and remote learning continuing in the afternoon. \u00b7 Grades 9 - 12, CRLS: In-person slots will be prioritized for Academic Tier 2 & 3 students (based on course grades) to attend in-person four days per week, and if there is additional space, 9th grade students. \u00b7 Grades 9 - 12, HSEP: HSEP will maintain its current operational model due to its success and student/family preferences. \u00b7 Wednesdays will remain a remote learning day for all students, to enable staff planning and collaboration Families are being sent an enrollment form on Friday, January 8th to specify their choice for either in-person or remote learning. This form will be due on Friday, January 15th. Schools will notify families on Monday, January 25th about their enrollment status and their classroom assignments. Additional discussion opportunities about upcoming plans will be announced soon (including school-based staff discussions and family information sessions, both districtwide and for individual schools). The state has extended the deadline for students to receive their required flu vaccine (unless there is a religious or medical exemption provided) to February 28th, 2021. CPS students between the ages of 12-22 can receive a flu shot at the Teen Health Center. Our upcoming meetings are as follows: \u00b7 Tuesday, January 12th, 2021 o Curriculum & Achievement Subcommittee Meeting | 5:30 PM \u00a7 To discuss the successes, challenges, learnings, opportunities and needs of remote learning in CPSD this spring, looking ahead to the fall semester o Special Meeting | 7:00 PM \u00a7 To discuss the Superintendent\u2019s proposed plan for expanding in-person learning in February \u00b7 Tuesday, January 19th, 2021 o Regular Meeting | 6:00 PM \u00b7 Tuesday, February 2nd, 2021 o Regular Meeting | 6:00 PM Please do not hesitate to reach out with any questions, suggestions, or concerns. ![](/Citizens/GetImage.aspx?Type=25&ID=/Aspose.Words.0f507de5-408e-4027-b23b-1560c6339da3.002.png) Respectfully, Sumbul Siddiqui",

      "full_text": "A Zoning Petition Has been received from Cambridge Redevelopment Authority regarding a Zoning Ordinance to reflect the proposed changes to the KSURP. Petition Language: To amend Article 14 of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT: KENDALL CENTER Introduction: When Eversource announced its plans for a new electrical substation on Fulkerson Street, the City Manager asked City and CRA staff, as well as representatives from the local development community, to explore an alternative site for the facility. After the numerous hearings held by City Council regarding the substation proposal, Boston Properties (BXP) approached the City and CRA about the idea of placing the substation on the site of the existing \u201cBlue Garage\u201d within the MXD District of the Kendall Square Urban Renewal Project Area. Although this alternate site is highly preferred to the Fulkerson Street location, there are nonetheless many complex technical challenges associated with relocating the substation to this parcel. It involves not only the design of the substation and high voltage access routes to the location, but also completing plans for the housing program currently outlined in the Infill Development Concept Plan, fulfilling interim and future parking requirements, and designing locations for additional development to provide financial support for this alternative location. The CRA hereby submits this zoning petition to amend the Article 14 of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance: MXD Development District: Kendall Center in order to accommodate the relocation of the Eversource substation to the BXP site. Corresponding changes will also be required to the Kendall Square Urban Renewal Plan. These changes would affirm the regional utility infrastructure land use in the district, as well as provide for additional development rights and make adjustments to some dimensional restrictions to facilitate the alternative site. 1. Replace the current Subsection 14.21.7(6) with the following text: 14.21.7(6) Transformer station, substation, gas regulator station, or pumping station and related utility uses. 2. Replace first three paragraphs of current Subsection 14.32.1 with the text below: 14.32.1 The Aggregate gross floor area (GFA) of development in the District shall not exceed the sum of (i) four million, four hundred seventy three thousand (4,473,000) square feet, plus (ii) six hundred thousand (600,000) square feet that shall be limited to multi-family residential uses as permitted in Section 14.21.4(1), for a total Aggregate GFA not to exceed five million, seventy three thousand (5,073,000) square feet. Up to sixty thousand (60,000) square feet of such Aggregate GFA of four million, four hundred seventy-three thousand (4,473,000) in clause (i) of the preceding sentence, shall be allowable only by special permit pursuant to Section 14.72. At least two hundred thousand (200,000) square feet of the GFA restricted to housing uses shall occur only within the area designated on the Zoning Map as the \u201cAmes Street District\u201d and has been approved by special permit dated March 27,2015 (the \u201cAmes Street Residential Project\u201d). Additionally, a building permit for construction of a residential project of at least four hundred thousand (400,000) square feet shall be issued prior to or concurrently with the issuance of a building permit for any project utilizing Utility Project GFA (as defined in Section 14.32.2 below). The design review process for a residential project of at least four hundred thousand (400,000) square feet shall also precede, or proceed concurrently with, the design review process for any project utilizing Utility Project GFA, in accordance with a special permit approving a Concept Plan as set forth in Section 14.32.2 below. 3\\. Add the following paragraph to the end of Subsection 14.32.2: Any additional Infill GFA for commercial uses that is not the subject of the existing Concept Plan approved by Special Permit PB #315 on March 20, 2017 (as amended by Amendment #1 (Major) dated January 31, 2019) (collectively, the \u201cExisting Concept Plan\u201d) may only be utilized in conjunction with the development by NSTAR Electric Company d/b/a Eversource (or its successors and assigns) of a substation within the District (\u201cthe Substation Project\u201d) and only on property within the District owned by the entity (or an affiliate thereof) that provided the land on which the Substation Project is to be developed. For the purposes of this Article, the eight hundred thousand (800,000) square feet of Infill GFA for commercial uses that is not the subject of the Existing Concept Plan may sometimes be referred to as \u201cUtility Project GFA\u201d. The issuance of a building permit for the Substation Project shall precede or be issued concurrently with the issuance of a building permit for any project utilizing Utility Project GFA. The MXD District is expected to achieve high standards for urban design, architectural design, environmental sustainability and open space design, and to transform the area into a recognizable center of activity and civic life for Kendall Square and the surrounding neighborhoods. The District should create open space to serve residents in the area, as well as workers, students from nearby institutions, and visitors. It should promote permeability at the edges of the District, and create public spaces that will feel welcoming and comfortable for all users. 4. Replace current Subsection 14.32.2.1(8) and 14.32.2.1(9) with the following text: 14.32.2.1 Infill Development Concept Plan Requirements: 8) A plan describing street, public infrastructure, and utility improvements to be undertaken in coordination with the development program, including all proposed water, stormwater and sewage facilities, and (in conjunction with the Substation Project) the general location of the proposed substation, which shall also be submitted to the Department of Public Works for review. 9) A plan illustrating proposed building scale, height and massing, including a model and a study demonstrating the anticipated shadow and wind impacts of all proposed buildings taller than 100 feet, and a general description of proposed mitigation measures that will be employed. Additionally the plan will include a narrative describing the plan\u2019s compatibility, coordination and consistency with the urban design guidelines set forth in the Kendall Square Final Report of the K2C2 Planning Study (\u201cK2 Guidelines\u201d) the Volpe Working Group\u2019s Planning & Design Principles dated July 20, 2017 (the \u201cVolpe Guidelines\u201d) and the planning principles referenced in Section 14.32.2. 5. Replace current Subsection 14.32.2.2 with the following text: 14.32.2.2 Findings and Approval. The Planning Board shall grant a special permit approving a Concept Plan upon finding that the new development identified within the plan meets the criteria for approval of a Planned Unit Development set forth in Section 12.35.3(3) of the Zoning Ordinance and the criteria for approval of a Project Review Special Permit set forth in Section 19.25 of the Zoning Ordinance. In making its findings, the Board shall consider the objectives set forth in the K2 Guidelines and the Volpe Guidelines. The approval of a Concept Plan shall serve to meet any applicable project review requirements of Article 19.000, and no additional Project Review Special Permit shall be required for new development that is identified within an approved Concept Plan. In addition, while the location of the Substation Project is to be shown on a Concept Plan, the actual development of the Substation Project shall not be included within the scope of a special permit approving a Concept Plan (but shall remain subject to all applicable regulations governing the construction of such projects). 6. Add the following new Subsection 14.32.5(d) at the end of Subsection 14.32.5: d) Inapplicability to Utility Project GFA. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 14.32.5. there shall be no Innovation Space requirement for any project utilizing Utility Project GFA (nor shall any such project utilizing Utility Project GFA be entitled to utilize Innovation Space in order to obtain a GFA Exemption under Section 14.32.6(3) below). 7\\. Replace current Subsection 14.32.6(2) and 14.32.6(3) with the following text: 2) Outdoor Area Exemptions: Private outdoor decks or balconies for multi- family residential or commercial development, up to eight percent (8%) of the building floor area. 3) Innovation Space: Innovation Space GFA up to the lesser of either twenty percent (20%) of the Infill GFA dedicated to Office and Biotechnology Manufacturing Uses or one hundred five thousand (105,000) square feet. In order for the Innovation Space GFA to be exempt from the Aggregate GFA limitations, at least twenty five percent (25%) of the Innovation Space utilization (measured by square footage or shared space membership) must be set aside as below market rate space to be offered by the CRA or the City to qualifying tenants for short-term leases consistent with Section 14.32.5(b). 8. Add the following new Subsections 14.32.6(7) and 14.32.6(8) at the end of Subsection 14.32.6: 7) Electrical Substation: The Substation Project shall be exempt from Aggregate GFA calculation as well as the requirements as to Floor Area Ratio. Further, substation construction shall not constitute Infill GFA (or Utility Project GFA). 8) Educational Lab, Classroom or Training Facility: Up to twenty thousand (20,000) square feet of educational, health or workforce training facilities operated to provide services to the general public (as opposed to private facilities that are solely accessible by tenants or occupants of commercial buildings within the District), which such services are either permitted as of right within the District in accordance with the provisions of this Article 14 or may otherwise be permitted by special permit. 9. Add the following new paragraph at the end of Section 14.33: Notwithstanding the provisions of the immediately preceding paragraph, there shall be no maximum floor area ratio for any project utilizing Infill GFA (including Utility Project GFA). However, the District Development Limitations in Section 14.32 shall continue to apply. 10. Replace first paragraph of Section 14.34 with the following text: 14.34 Building Height Limitation. The maximum building height in the District shall be two hundred and fifty (250) feet. Notwithstanding the foregoing, one building within the District may reach four hundred (400) feet provided, however, that the occupied floors above two hundred and fifty feet (250) feet may only contain residential and associated amenity space. Additionally, the floorplate of any portion of a building above two hundred fifty (250) feet shall not exceed twelve thousand five hundred (12,500) square feet. 11. Replace current Section 14.38 with the following text: 14.38 Active Ground Floors. The ground floor of newly constructed buildings utilizing fifty thousand (50,000) square feet or more of Infill GFA, where that ground floor fronts onto Main Street, Broadway or Ames Street, must be occupied by (i) Retail and Consumer Service uses, as listed in Section 14.21.3, or (ii) active public gathering space (whether enclosed or open), along a minimum length of seventy-five percent (75%) of the building fa\u00e7ade along this frontage; provided, however, that the requirement shall be forty percent (40%) for any building with a fa\u00e7ade length of one hundred (100) feet or less along such frontage onto Main Street, Broadway or Ames Street. Dimensional variations and alternate uses may be approved by the Planning Board upon determining that the specific uses and designs proposed are consistent with the purpose and intent of this Section 14.38. Alternatively, if a Concept Plan provides for the redevelopment of existing buildings to include new Retail and Consumer Service uses along the ground floor of any of the identified street frontages, then the Planning Board may permit a reduction in the required length of active street frontage for new buildings for up to fifty percent (50%) of the length of new active street frontage provided in existing buildings and only if the Board finds that it results in a better outcome for the District as a whole. Banks and financial institutions shall not be considered active ground floor uses for the purposes of meeting this requirement. 12. Replace current Section 14.39 with the following text: 14.39 Letter of Commitment. It is acknowledged and agreed that the Letter of Commitment dated December 21, 2015 by Boston Properties Limited Partnership is hereby replaced by the Letter of Commitment dated January 28, 2021 by the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority. As such, the Letter of Commitment dated December 21, 2015 by Boston Properties is declared null and void and of no further force or effect, and shall no longer be binding upon Boston Properties Limited Partnership or its successors and assigns. 13. Replace the first paragraph of Subsection 14.52.2 with the following text: 14.52.2 With the exception of multi-family residential development, there are no minimum parking requirements for new development in the District. Residential development shall provide at a minimum 0.25 automobile parking spaces per dwelling unit. All proposed development shall be restricted from constructing parking spaces, either on or off the lot within the District, beyond the maximum allowances of Table 1. If a development includes more than one category of use, then the number of spaces allowed for the development shall be the sum of the allowance for each category of use. Where the computation of required spaces results in a fractional number, only a fraction of one half or more shall be counted as one. The Planning Board may approve arrangements for shared parking of such residential parking spaces with commercial spaces or otherwise adjust the minimum parking requirements based on review and analysis of anticipated parking demand within the Transportation Impact Study. 14. Replace current Subsection 14.52.3 with the following text: 14.52.3 The parking allowances specified in Table 1 may be satisfied by a lease agreement between the developer and the City, other public entity, or private consortium for use of parking spaces in a public or pooled private parking facility located within the District (or, in the case of the spaces required for residential uses, located outside of the District but within one thousand (1,000) feet of the residential building for which the parking is being provided, measured from property edge to property edge), provided that on a temporary basis, spaces required for residential uses may be within two thousand (2,000) feet of the residential building while permanent residential parking is being constructed. The total number of parking spaces leased and constructed within the district for development on a lot shall not exceed the maximum allowances provided for in Table 2. 15. Replace current Subsection 14.52.6 with the following text: 14.52.6 Bicycle Parking: Bike parking shall be provided as set forth in Section 6.100 of this Zoning Ordinance; provided that in issuing a special permit approving a Concept Plan, the Planning Board may determine that the bicycle parking requirements for individual buildings shown on the Concept Plan may be met utilizing a campus planning approach toward bicycle parking. 14.52.6.1 Intent: To allow flexibility within the high-density environment of the MXD District while providing high quality, equitable, and thoughtfully planned bicycle parking and sustainable transportation amenities for all users, consistent with Section 6.108.2. Given the complexity of infrastructure requirements of the Substation Project, the bicycle parking provisions set forth in Section 6.100 is infeasible, and a comprehensive bicycle parking plan will be needed to help to balance space constraints and competing uses on or near the ground level. 14.52.6.2 Bike Parking Plan: The bicycle parking plan may utilize a combination of the following strategies, or other design provisions that meet the principles of Section 6.108.3: a) Public Bicycle Sharing Facilities: Where a new, standard-size Public Bicycle Sharing Station or larger is provided (i) on the lot, or (ii) on a site within five hundred (500) feet of the lot, with written approval of the City if located on a public street or other City Property, or otherwise by legally enforceable mutual agreement with the owner of the land on which the station is to be located. If Public Bicycle Sharing Station(s) are provided, each bicycle dock within that station may count for up to two (2) required bicycle parking spaces. Should it be deemed beneficial to the operation of a Public Bicycle Sharing system by the Community Development Department and the Public Bicycle Sharing system operator, a developer may meet additional bicycle parking requirements by providing a secure, accessible and geographically central location for the storage and/or maintenance of the publicly shared bicycles. If a Public Bicycle Sharing storage and/or maintenance facility is provided, each designated bicycle storage space shall count for up to one-half (0.5) of a required bicycle parking space b) Countercyclical Bicycle Parking Facility: As the District will contain residential and commercial uses having different peak parking demand times, multiple buildings may share parking facilities within three hundred (300) feet from each other. A shared bicycle parking space may count as a required bicycle parking space for both a residential use and a commercial use within separate buildings within a campus plan. c) Complementary Valet Bicycle Parking: Bicycle parking may be provided through a valet bicycle parking program that is offered free of charge to users. In order to utilize valet bicycle parking, a developer must submit for the Planning Board\u2019s approval a plan describing: i. The design of the valet bicycle parking facilities (which shall not be required to conform with the dimensional regulations of Section 6.100). ii. The proposed number of attendants, number of bicycle parking spaces provided, hours of valet service operations, and other pertinent information. When an approved valet bicycle parking program that was utilized to meet the requirements of Section 6.100 is discontinued, the property owner must either bring the bicycle parking spaces into full conformance with the bicycle parking requirements of Section 6.100 or seek approval from the Planning Board for an alternative approach. The combination of the strategies above, or other provisions accepted by the Planning Board, shall allow a project to adjust the minimum required number of bicycle parking spaces, as supported through analysis made available to the Planning Board.",

      "full_text": "A communication transmitted from Louis A. DePasquale, City Manager, relative to the biennial City of Cambridge Resident Telephone Survey for 2020. I am transmitting the results of the biennial City of Cambridge Resident Telephone Survey for 2020. I am very pleased to report that overall opinions of the City's core attributes remain very favorable, and residents' opinions of the City's COVID-19 response are widely regarded as positive. On perhaps the most all-encompassing measure of resident sentiment, satisfaction with overall experiences with the City is at a record high level for the 20-year history of this survey program. Last year was an incredibly challenging year, and I am extremely proud that during a pandemic, the percentage of respondents who are \"totally\" satisfied with their interactions with the City remained at the highest level we have seen over the course of this survey program. Moreover, the combined overall satisfaction rose from 55% in 2018 to 60% today. I believe this reflects our highly capable and extremely dedicated workforce and the focus they place on the initiatives and priorities of the Council. I want to thank City staff for their commitment to our community and for their hard work. This year's survey asked a series of questions regarding the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, 81% of respondents rated the City's handling of the pandemic as \"excellent\" or \"good.\" Specific to the City's performance during the COVID-19 pandemic, 79% of respondents rated public information services as \"excellent\" or \"good,\" 75% rated public health services as \"excellent\" or \"good,\" and 73% of respondents rated the City's online/virtual services as \"excellent\" or \"good.\" When asked about COVID-19 testing services, 56% of respondents provided a rating of \"excellent\" or \"good,\" while 19% \u201cdid not know.\u201d Almost three-quarters of survey respondents indicated that they closely follow public health updates and recommendations on COVID-19. Finally, survey respondents indicated they trust the state government the most for public health information (38%), followed by the City and state equally (26%), followed by the City government alone (24%), and lastly, the federal government (4%). Almost a third of respondents indicated that they experienced a loss of employment income since mid-March, with job loss twice as high as the norm (64%) among Hispanic residents and significantly higher among African-American residents (45%). The survey serves as a valuable tool to help inform us about issues and areas where the City is excelling and areas that the City may need to pay particular attention to, and where we might focus even more efforts in the future. I am proud that areas related to City performance, access to services, and public information have seen increases. Overall city performance is up since 2018, with fully two-thirds (66%) of respondents giving the City either \"excellent\" or \"good\" rating. The City's public information received an \"excellent\" or \"good\" rating from 83% of respondents. And this year, the fewest residents since the inception of the survey agreed with a statement that they were unable to conduct business with the City during regular business hours. In 2018, 43% agreed with the statement, and in 2020 just 32% agreed. Among the 11 City services we explored for performance, excellent ratings improved on: 'street maintenance' (+9) and 'public information' (+3). Several services experienced drops in \"excellent\" ratings from 2018. The largest declines were: fire department services (-16), schools and education (-15), and police department services (-10). Affordable housing/housing (30%) was again identified as the \"single most important issue facing the City of Cambridge today.\" Housing affordability continues to be a significant regional concern, and these results reaffirm the City's strong financial and policy commitment and prioritization of the issue. The COVID-19 pandemic (17%), educations and schools (9%), jobs and economy (7%), and climate change issues (5%) round out the top five \"single most important\" issues identified in the 2020 survey. Residents' ratings of the quality of life in Cambridge have risen since 2018, increasing from an \"excellent\" rating of 39% in 2018 to 42% in 2020, and \"Fair\" and \"Poor\" ratings decreased from 12% in 2018 down to 9% in 2020. An impressive 92% give \"excellent\" or \"good\" ratings to Cambridge as \"a place to live,\" and 89% give \"excellent\" or \"good\" ratings to Cambridge as \"a safe place to live.\" Moving forward, we will closely monitor areas that saw decreases in the \"excellent\" ratings, such as: economic development (-12), a place to raise a child (-8), a place welcoming to all races and cultures (-7) ability to have a positive impact on the community (-7), ability to participate in government (-6), and environmental planning and policy (-6). This year's survey also found that the percentage of residents who have ridden a bike more than 26 times (48%) has gone up 4 points since 2018, and those visiting a park more than 26 times (48%) has gone up 2 points since 2018. The percentage of residents who say they have \"never\" attended a City Council meeting (57%) has dropped 7 points since 2018. The number of people who have visited the City's website more than 26 times (15%) has tripled from 2018. The share of residents who say they have \"never\" visited the website (10%) is down 17 points since 2018. The primary method of conducting business with the City is now through the website (47%), and in- person interactions are down 15 points, dropping from 32% in 2018 to just 17% in 2020. The survey was conducted September 9 -September 13, 2020. The statistically valid random telephone survey of residents has been conducted every two years since 2000 and was led by Polity Research Consulting. A web version supplemented this year's survey, with 2,551 individual respondents completing the survey. The survey responses provide a snapshot of public sentiment towards various issues and public services in the City. Some variation in the results from survey to survey is expected. In reviewing the survey results, it is important to pay attention to any emerging and long-term trends. I hope you will look closely at the report by Polity Research Consulting to view all of the changes in the 2020 survey. Also enclosed is a separate compilation of aggregated results for various responses and corresponding survey results since 2000. Overall, for the 42 questions in this survey with historical data, 77% of the 2020 aggregated responses (32 questions) are above the historical average for each of the questions (see attached worksheet). I expect to work closely with City departments to further analyze the results to incorporate relevant insights into priorities and future work plans, and the overall budget process. I anticipate that the survey results will be a valuable tool for the Council and the public to understand community issues. I welcome a more detailed exploration of the survey results with the Council. I am happy to ask a representative from Polity Research Consulting to attend a committee meeting.",

In response to Awaiting Report Item Number 20-74, regarding keeping Riverbend Park opened beyond December 27, 2020, please be advised of the following: As requested in the policy order, City staff reached out to DCR to discuss the possibility of this extension. Based on these discussions, DCR has indicated that it is not feasible to further extend the Riverbend Park closures of Memorial Drive from Fresh Pond Parkway to Western Avenue. Both DCR and the City agree that extending Riverbend Park beyond the normal mid-November end date and including both Saturdays and Sundays has been successful and well used, and has benefited the community. However, emerging resource constraints for DCR make it infeasible to continue this program beyond the end of 2020. Going forward, we will continue to coordinate with DCR to determine if there are opportunities to make additional recreational opportunities available to Cambridge residents.",

Seidman regarding a financial assessment of the Canal District Kendall (PUD-CDK) Zoning Petition submitted by BioMed Realty. I am pleased to transmit a memo from the development economics consultant team led by Karl F. Seidman regarding a financial assessment of the Canal District Kendall (PUD-CDK) Zoning Petition submitted by BioMed Realty. This memo is in response to a Policy Order seeking a professional financial assessment of added value created for owner/petitioner-led up-zonings for developments of more than 50,000 square feet. It has been reviewed by staff in the Community Development Department, Assessing Department, Finance Department, and Budget Office. The analysis is an independent estimation of the net increase in project value to a developer if the proposed zoning change is adopted, given reasonable assumptions and information obtained by the consultant about current market conditions and project costs. The net increase in value is compared to the value of the community benefits proposed by BioMed Realty, which is based on the cost to the developer of providing such benefits. It should be noted that this assessment is an estimate that includes many variables that can change due to external factors and that can significantly impact development values and costs. Moreover, this analysis reflects a snapshot in time, and cannot accurately predict future market conditions or performance. For example, the long-term impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the office and lab market is not fully known or understood at this time. As described in the memo, a developer undertaking a project from conception to completion carries significant risk as market conditions change. If unfavorable conditions lead to the project\u2019s costs exceeding its value, the development might not go forward and the associated benefits would not be realized. In addition to explicit community benefits identified in the zoning and draft Letter of Commitment, the proposed development advances our planning goals and provides benefits to the public that cannot be quantified. By creating public space and an arts and culture anchor in the heart of Kendall Square, the proposed new building will deliver long-desired community-focused uses furthering Kendall Square\u2019s transformation from a predominantly commercial district to a vibrant, mixed-use neighborhood. The proposed relocation of the Eversource GTS infrastructure away from Third Street will have a transformative effect on the pedestrian environment along Third Street and this part of the City. Development will also result in both temporary and permanent jobs within Cambridge, and help to sustain the tax base and overall economic health of the City as a whole. I believe this analysis, along with the positive recommendations from the Planning Board and Ordinance Committee, demonstrate that this proposal will result in considerable benefits to the City that are balanced with the increased development value to the property owner. I want to thank Karl Seidman and his team for this work, and everyone who provided input to help bring this report to completion. As the first petitioner to be the focus of this type of assessment, I want to thank BioMed Realty for being a willing participant. I hope that this analysis provides the City Council with the necessary guidance to make its decision.",

      "full_text": "A communication transmitted from Louis A. DePasquale, City Manager, relative to the following requests relative to the eminent domain taking of 185 Larch Road: 1. Appropriate $7,702,000 from Free Cash to the General Fund Law Department Travel & Training (Damages) Account to cover the pro tanto payment toward the expenses of acquisition as required by the above referenced Sections of Chapters 40 and 43 of the General Laws for the property located at 185 Larch Road owned by BB&N; 2. Approve an Order to take by eminent domain a 185 Larch Road; and 3. Appropriate $10,798,000 from Free Cash to the General Fund Law Department Travel & Training (Damages) Account to fund the settlement of BB&N\u2019s remaining eminent domain damages claim. I am writing to recommend that the City Council approve an Order to take by eminent domain a parcel of land, consisting of approximately 4 acres, located at 185 Larch Road (as shown on Assessors Map 248, Parcel 79), owned by Buckingham Browne and Nichols School (BB&N) and known as Buckingham Field that is currently used as a playing field by BB&N. Pursuant to Section 30 of Chapter 43, Section 14 of Chapter 40, and Chapter 79 of the General Laws, all as amended, it is provided that the City Council may take in fee in the name of the City of Cambridge for any municipal purpose any land within the limits of the City not already appropriated for public use. For several decades the City Council has been asking City Managers to actively pursue opportunities to acquire and increase access to open space for all residents. Unfortunately, this goal has been very difficult to achieve due to the lack of availability of land suitable for open space use in Cambridge. Due to this, when BB&N expressed interest in selling Buckingham Field, we aggressively pursued this opportunity to acquire additional open space in Cambridge. Therefore, I am pleased to present this to you and I strongly recommend that the City take advantage of this unique opportunity to acquire land currently being used as athletic fields to increase the City\u2019s open space. BB&N is interested in selling Buckingham Field to the City, and has expressed a strong preference for its continued use as open space for future generations of Cantabrigians, and I recommend using the eminent domain process for what is called a \u201cfriendly taking\u201d as the means to acquire this property from BB&N. I also recommend that the City Council appropriate funds for the acquisition of Buckingham Field, as set forth in detail below. Background BB&N is in the process of acquiring land in Watertown to consolidate its athletic playing fields. This transaction is expected to be executed in January 2021. BB&N is purchasing approximately 6 acres in Watertown to consolidate its athletic complex and is therefore making Buckingham Field available to the City for purchase. As stated above, the ability to purchase approximately 4 acres of open space within the City is a rare opportunity. This property is situated across Fresh Pond Parkway from the Water Treatment Facility and Kingsley Park, and is a short distance from the Tobin School complex. Buckingham Brown and Nichols has offered to sell this parcel to the City (via the proposed friendly eminent domain taking) at a reduced sales price of $18.5 million which is below what they might expect to receive in a competitive sale environment. As part of our preliminary conversations about this potential sale, BB&N has indicated that it would like to retain the possible use of this athletic field for up to 3 years while its new athletic complex is being developed. Assuming that BB&N uses the athletic field during this three year period, BB&N will compensate the City for the continued use, and the compensation to the City would be the following: Year 1 - $0; Year 2 - $100,000 and; Year 3 - $200,000, for a total of $300,000. At this time, the City will pay $18.2 million and if BB&N does not use the field, the City will pay up to the remaining $300,000 of the $18.5 total purchase price. BB&N has indicated that the athletic field would be available for use by the City at the conclusion of BB&N\u2019s school year in the months of June, July and August for athletic uses, and for use by the City for School programs as well as other mutually agreeable programs at mutually agreeable times during the school year throughout the proposed 3-year option period. The City has agreed to work with BB&N to make available for BB&N\u2019s use City playing fields and tennis courts if not in use by the City during the transition. Excluding the golf course, there are approximately 265 acres of city-owned public open space in Cambridge, including parks, athletic fields and school playgrounds. The City\u2019s total land area is 6.26 square miles or 4,006 acres. Demand for open space in the city continues to be extremely high. This is especially true since Cambridge is one of the most densely populated cities in the country, and estimated population growth City-wide over the past decade has generally outpaced the expansion of public open spaces. Further, increasing the amount of open space in Cambridge is especially challenging because of an extremely limited amount of undeveloped private land, as well as typically very high costs to acquire land in the City. It is extremely important to explore, and when feasible act on, every opportunity to add to the City\u2019s open space network, especially during these difficult times as a result of COVID-19. Process As noted earlier, BB&N is expecting to close on their new property in Watertown in January 2021 and needs the City to complete the eminent domain proceeding and pay the proceeds to BB&N prior to the Watertown purchase. If the City chooses to move forward with this purchase, funds need to be appropriated, and the purchase and sale of this property must be executed and completed by early January 2021. The City intends to acquire this property through what is commonly referred to as a \u201cfriendly taking.\u201d A friendly taking describes the use of the statutory eminent domain procedure to acquire a property that an owner seeks to sell to the City. This property is already being valued below market value because the owner is a charitable educational organization that is tax exempt due to the charitable use of the property under Massachusetts Law, so the purchase price allowed pursuant to law is substantially lower than fair market value would be. The assessed valued for this property has remained at $6,161,600 for the past three plus years. This assessed value does not represent the property\u2019s current fair market value as tax exempt properties are only reviewed during the revaluation which occurs once every five years. The true indication of the current fair market-rate value of this property has been estimated by a highly qualified appraiser retained by the City Solicitor. The appraiser Steven R. Foster, MAI of Lincoln Property Company has determined that the fair market value of the property at its highest and best use, which is characterized as residential use, is $20,000,000. The City\u2019s Director of Assessment Gayle Willett has reviewed the Foster appraisal as an additional examination to ensure that the appraised value represents the current market rate value of the property. The City would pay the amount allowed by law as a pro tanto to BB&N. A pro tanto is an initial payment that the property owner can accept without prejudice to its right to bring a claim for the full amount of damages that it asserts is due. Under the law, the property owner has the right to challenge the amount of the pro tanto payment in a legal proceeding and could seek to persuade a court that it is entitled to the current fair market value of the property. The eminent domain procedure allows the City to exceed the limits that G.L. c.40, \u00a714 and G.L. c.43, \u00a730 impose on the purchase price of a property (which limit the purchase price that the City may pay to the average of the three prior years\u2019 assessed value plus a 25% increase) after an owner of land taken by eminent domain has sought damages for the remainder of the fair market value or purchase price of the property. The City intends, subject to the City Council\u2019s approval, to pay the remainder of the purchase price of $18,500,000 through settlement of an eminent domain damages claim-this is why this type of transaction is referred to as a \u201cfriendly taking.\u201d I will initiate a settlement of any such claim with the property owner if the City Council votes to approve the appropriation of the pro tanto, authorizes the taking of this property by eminent domain, and appropriates funds to settle the damages claim. As an overview, some of the steps in this process to satisfy legal requirements include: 1. The City has retained an appraiser, Steven R. Foster, MAI of Lincoln Property Company, who performed and evaluated a required independent appraisal of the property; 2. The City has received a First American Title Insurance Company Title Commitment issued by one of the company\u2019s agents, the law firm of Marsh, Moriarty, Ontell & Golder, P.C., who performed a full title examination of the property; 3. The City Council must vote to approve the Appropriation Order in the amount of $7,702,000 to appropriate funds from Free Cash to pay the pro tanto, as set forth above and below; 4. The City Council must, by a two-thirds vote, vote to approve the Order of Taking; and 5. The City Council must vote to approve the Appropriation Order in the amount of $10,798,000 to appropriate funds from Free Cash to settle the eminent domain damages claim and pay the remainder of the purchase price of $18,500,000, which will enable the City to acquire the property and thereby resolve BB&N\u2019s damages claim. Requests for Appropriation I am hereby requesting an appropriation in the amount of $7,702,000 from Free Cash to the General Fund Law Department Travel and Training (Judgement and Damages) Account to cover the pro tanto payment toward the expenses of acquisition as required by the above referenced Sections of Chapters 40 and 43 of the General Laws for the property located at 185 Larch Road owned by BB&N. After the City Council votes on the Appropriation Order to fund the pro tanto payment and votes by a two-third vote on the Order of Taking, I am also hereby requesting that the City Council vote to approve the second Appropriation Order to appropriate funds in the amount of $10,798,000 from Free Cash to the General Fund Law Department Travel and Training (Judgement and Damages) Account to fund the settlement of BB&N\u2019s remaining eminent domain damages claim. I strongly recommend that the City Council approve this unique opportunity to acquire a parcel of 4 acres presently used as open space and vote to approve the Orders of Taking and Appropriation of funds. However, if in future years the City Council may want the option of using this property for other municipal purposes, I have fashioned the Order of Taking to indicate that the land is taken for open space use or any other municipal uses or purposes.",

Statement of Goals and Guidelines and Standards for Review The Goal of the District and of this Order is to protect the Harvard Square Conservation District\u2019s distinctive physical and experiential characteristics and to enhance the livability and vital- ity of the District. The Historical Commission should seek to enhance the unique physical environment and visual form of the District; preserve its architecturally and historically significant structures and their settings; encourage creative design that contributes to the richness of its environment; mitigate character-diminishing impacts of new development; and discourage homogeneity by encouraging diversity of development and open space patterns and building scales and ages. The District must remain a pedestrian-friendly, accessible, human-scale, quirky, mixed-use environment that supports dynamic urban experiences, complements nearby neighborhoods, and respects the history and traditions of its location. The following Secondary Goals for the District are intended to provide general guidance in a wide variety of situations, and are not intended to be applied to every project. They are statements of policy, not prescriptive measures that must be applied equally in each situation. 1. Significant Buildings. Preserve historically or architecturally significant buildings and structures as well as those that contribute to the distinctive visual character or historical significance of the District. 2. Sustain the vitality of the commercial environment. Sustain the vitality of the commercial environment while preserving architecturally-significant or original building fabric at street level and above. Encourage the restoration of missing features where these have been documented. Except for protected storefronts, encourage creative contemporary commercial design inside the restored framework of storefront openings. Encourage creative signage. Support below-grade commercial spaces where appropriate. Regardless of use, encourage architectural solutions that preserve storefront fabric, transparency, and utility. 3. Contemporary Design. Where context allows, support creative, contemporary design for new construction that complements the context of abutting buildings and enhances the character of the subdistrict. Recognize and respect well-reasoned contemporary design during the review process. Support innovative approaches to enhancing the unique character of Harvard Square while mitigating the detrimental impacts of development on proximate areas. 4. Diversity of Form. Build on and sustain the diversity of existing building form, scale and material. Preserve and encourage appropriate green spaces, scale-appropriate open spaces, and new buildings that support the prevailing character of the subdistrict. Pre- serve the remaining wood frame buildings throughout the District. Maintain a consistent setback or streetwall condition where that character has been set. Support small-scale storefronts to preserve the vitality and character of the streetscape. 5. Public Environment. Create a high-quality public environment in the District with compatible materials, lighting, signage, and street furniture such as bollards, benches, move- able seating, and the like. Provide adequate facilities for trash and recycling and surfaces that can be cleaned and maintained. Encourage planted greenspaces and accommodate trees where possible. 6. Pedestrian Experience. Protect and enhance the pedestrian experience. Expand the net- work of pedestrian walkways and paths wherever they can conveniently provide alternate routes through the District. Increase public access to alleys and interior spaces where appropriate and upgrade the paving and landscaping of such spaces. Enhance accessibility and safety for pedestrians throughout the District. 7. Residential Development. Enhance the all-hours neighborhood quality of Harvard Square by supporting existing residential uses and encouraging additional residential units in mixed-use buildings. 8. Compatible Design. Encourage compatible design that supports a wide diversity of uses serving the needs of surrounding neighborhoods, students, workers and visitors from around the world. 9. Transportation. Encourage creative solutions to the District\u2019s transportation issues by providing balanced accommodations for through and local traffic, cyclists, and pedestri- ans. Promote smooth movement of traffic on through streets and seek creative design and management solutions for side streets where traffic volume and speeds can be regulated to give highest priority to pedestrians. Provide adequate bicycle parking throughout the District. Protect pedestrian safety and experience through careful design and place- ment of features such as loading docks, curb cuts, and receptacles for trash and recy- cling. Encourage replacement of surface parking lots with compatible new structures. Discourage provision of on-site parking for new construction. 10. Environmental Sustainability. Encourage environmentally sustainable development that takes into consideration the embodied energy of the existing built environment, material life cycles, passive design, energy conservation, and current standards for best energy conservation practices. Alterations to existing buildings that seek to promote energy conservation should be accomplished in a manner that respects character-defining mate- rials and designs. 11. Architectural lighting. Architectural (building fa\u00e7ade) lighting, streetscape lighting, and signage lighting, when allowed by a Certificate of Appropriateness, should reinforce definitive characteristics of historic and contemporary architecture as well as create high quality 24-hour streetscapes. To achieve these goals, projects should minimize bright- ness, and light trespass, monitor light color (temperature Kelvin), and focus lighting on significant features. The foregoing goals also recite the standards for preservation and change within the District. In addition to the factors specified in Section 2.78.220, and subject to any specific provisions of this Order, in exercising its authority with respect to the District and in considering applications for certificates of appropriateness, hardship, or nonapplicability, the Historical Commission shall be guided by the preceding general goal for the District as a whole and by such of the pre- ceding secondary goals as it determines to be applicable to the project or situation before it. The Historical Commission shall also be guided by the standards and guidelines described in the \u201cFinal Report of the Harvard Square Neighborhood Conservation District Study Committee,\u201d dated November 29, 2000, as amended by the \u201cFinal Report of the 2017-19 Harvard Square Conservation District Study Committee,\u201d which after public hearing the Historical Commission may adopt as regulations and thereafter amend from time to time. In addition, the Historical Commission and project proponents shall consider the amended goals and guidelines specific to each of the seven subdistricts that make up the Harvard Square Conservation District. The subdistrict goals and guidelines describe the physical and historical development of each area over time, identify notable buildings and spaces, and set forth preservation priorities and recommendations for each sub-district. As permitted by Chapter 2.78.190.B, the Historical Commission may determine from time to time after public hearing that certain categories of exterior architectural features, structures, or signs may be altered without review by the Commission; provided, however, that every such alteration shall be determined by the Executive Director of the Historical Commission to con- form to the regulations adopted by the Commission for the administration of the District.",

NEIGHBORHOOD & LONG TERM PLANNING, PUBLIC FACILITIES, ARTS & CELEBRATION COMMITTEE MEMBERS Councillor Patricia Nolan, Chair Councillor Dennis Carlone Vice Mayor Alanna Mallon Councillor Marc McGovern Councillor Quinton Zondervan In City Council December 21, 2020 ---|--- The Neighborhood & Long-Term Planning; Public Facilities, Arts and Celebrations Committee held a public hearing on Wednesday, October 14, 2020 at 2:00 p.m. in the Sullivan Chamber to discuss the process for conducting the feasibility study for municipal broadband and the Request for Proposal. Present at the hearing were Councillor Nolan, Chair of the Committee, Councillor Carlone, Naomie Stephen, Executive Assistant to the City Council, and Paula M. Crane, Deputy City Clerk. Present via Zoom were Vice Mayor Mallon, Councillor McGovern, Councillor Zondervan, Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler, Mayor Siddiqui, Louis DePasquale, City Manager, Lisa Peterson, Deputy City Manager, David Kale, Assistant City Manager for Fiscal Affairs, Nancy Glowa, City Solicitor, Patrick McCormack, Chief Information Officer, Information Technology Department, Lee Gianetti, Director of Communications and Community Relations, Christopher Schmidt, Heather Hoffman, John Hawkinson, Kathy Watkins, Kavish Gandhi, Ken Field, Lee Farris, Phyllis Bretholtz, Roy Russell and Saul Tannenbaum. Councillor Nolan convened the hearing and read the Call of the Meeting and the Governor\u2019s Order regarding remote participation. She asked for a Roll Call to indicate a quorum for the hearing. The roll was called and resulted as follows: YEAS: Councillor Nolan, Councillor Carlone, Vice Mayor Mallon, Councillor McGovern, Councillor Zondervan -5 NAYS: -0 ABSENT: -0 and a quorum was present. Councillor Nolan outlined steps that led to this hearing. She noted that the City established a Broadband Task Force (BTF) which worked from 2014-2016, and issued a report that is worth reading. She said that the next step was to recommend a feasibility study. She said that her understanding is that an RFP started being prepared at that time, but then work stopped and it never moved forward. She said that the City Council passed several orders which languished and never started. She said that the only thing that happened was a Digital Equity Study which was approved by the City Council in November of 2018, a 12-month that was supposed to be completed last January that also was significantly delayed. She stated that she saw a draft summary of that report prior to taking office in December of 2019. She said that the report is still not finished, and as a result the emergence of the Covid pandemic meant the report was delayed even further. She noted that only this past summer were many residents in public housing even surveyed. Councillor Nolan said that in February, the City Council passed an order for an RFP for feasibility study by April and in May the City Council voted down the IT budget. She said that in June the City Manager promised a study with an RFP by the summer. Councillor Nolan said that she and Vice Mayor Mallon met with City staff at the end of the summer and agreed to set up a meeting to review the elements of the RFP. She said that the timing is delayed yet again and the RFP has not yet been drafted. She said that she is hopeful that a productive hearing can be had. She explained that the Committee will begin with public comment, followed by remarks from City staff working on this issue. She said that a key part of the hearing will be questions from City staff to the City Council about expectations for the study. She noted her hope that the focus will be to provide guidance for City staff as they finalize the RFP. She stated that another hearing will be likely so that City staff can present where they are in thinking about the RFP and the study. Councillor Nolan opening the hearing to Public Comment at 2:06 p.m. Roy Russell, 40 Cottage Street, read from a prepared written statement (ATTACHMENT A) regarding issues that should be included in the RFP for a Cambridge Municipal Broadband Feasibility Study. Lee Farris, 269 Norfolk Street, stated that she is speaking for the Cambridge Residents Alliance who have long supported some form of municipal broadband. She said that it is known that there are gaps in coverage and that not everyone is able to get broadband for either financial reasons or the location where they live. She said that many middle- and upper-income people complain about the cost, low speed and quality that we do have. She stated that she trying to ensure that broadband is fast, affordable to a wide range of people and available to all in the city is her goal. As it relates to the delay by the City, she noted that she hopes that the City will move forward quickly without further delay. She questioned if the RFP is public and if so, how it can be accessed. Saul Tannenbaum, 16 Cottage Street, Upgrade Cambridge, stated that he endorses Mr. Russell\u2019s comments. He said that almost 4 years ago, the BTF presented its findings to the Committee. He said that at the time they were told that the City was working on and RFP and that the City would be coming to the City Council for an appropriation. He said that never happened. He said that the delay has had real world impact in terms of digital equity. He said one of the findings of the BTF was to work on digital equity but because the City stopped working on these, it was unprepared when the pandemic hit, and everything went online. He said that he recognizes that the City Council appropriated $50,000 on digital equity issues and he would like to see a report back on that. He said that the City should own and control the infrastructure and rely on private partners to provide the retail service. He said that it is disappointing at the least that we still don\u2019t have an RFP to review. He said that he is fortunate to have broadband service so he can participate in the meeting without problems while others cannot. Christopher Schmidt, 17 Laurel Street, thanked the City Manager for moving forward on this. He said that understanding the cost to build out a network is important. He said that he wants to ensure that whatever is done takes a real concrete look at what the costs are including working with the Electrical Department and technical advisers. He said that he wants to ensure that the RFP leaves the door open to not attach costs to the day-to-day operation. He said that the focus should be on treating this as a utility. He said that we must understanding what people are paying today. He said businesses must pay a premium for broadband services. He said that if you look at small businesses, these people are paying thousands of dollars. He noted that another important thing to look at is understanding options for models. He said that older residents depend on television and this needs to be considered in the RFP. Phyllis Bretholtz, 65 Antrim Street, stated that she supports everything that has been said. She said that her biggest concern is that this is a social justice issue. Families are struggling to maintain sanity for their children and seniors who do not have access because they cannot afford it is completely unethical. She strongly supports the City Manager and City Council moving forward and she is optimistic. Louis DePasquale stated that he looks forward to the discussion. He noted that he is joined by our Chief Information Officer Patrick McCormick and Director of Communications Lee Gianetti. He said that Pat and Lee have been involved with the City\u2019s broadband efforts for a number of years -- Lee as a member of the City Manager\u2019s Office and Pat as a member of the former Broadband Task Force and now as the City\u2019s CIO. He said that Pat and Lee are leading the City\u2019s digital equity initiatives and they are leading our broadband efforts moving forward. Mr. DePasquale thanked the Committee Chair, Councillor Nolan, and the Vice Mayor for organizing this meeting. He said that in June, based on feedback from the City Council, he committed to funding the next phase of a broadband feasibility study with an appropriation in the fall. He said that today he hopes that we will be able to engage in a meaningful discussion regarding the goals for our next steps and the City Council\u2019s shared expectations which will assist the City in finishing our scope of work. Mr. DePasquale said that the Committee is aware of his doubts regarding the sustainability and fiscal prudence of the City exploring a municipal broadband system and given that we are in the middle of a pandemic, the potential costs are very concerning to him. However, he noted that he wants to be clear that he is committed, like the City Council, to efforts that will help us address digital divide issues in Cambridge. He said that Lee and Pat are working on an RFP for the next steps in our municipal broadband feasibility work and they are working with our consultants to conclude our digital equity study. He stated his hope that we will be able to prioritize a solution that primarily addresses the needs of our most vulnerable residents. Mr. DePasquale said that there are a numerous issues and uncertainties that need to be worked out for us to have a common understanding of the impact a municipal broadband system will have on both the finances of the City and digital equity issues affecting our residents. He stated his hope that that as we collaboratively define the goals and expectations for our upcoming municipal broadband efforts, the City Council will support efforts and approaches that prioritize the needs of residents who are impacted by the digital divide. Lee Gianetti stated that they have been working on a scope of work for next steps in the broadband work. He said that before he gives an overview of how the City is thinking about how they are structuring their analysis, it would helpful for Pat McCormick to give a brief overview and summary of Broadband Task Force\u2019s recommendations and key questions that they believe should be included in the next phase of the City\u2019s efforts. Following Mr. McCormick\u2019s remarks, he will give the Committee an update on how the City is thinking about approaching the scope of work for an RFP. Pat McCormick stated that he is excited to speak on this topic. He stated that while he has only been working for the City since mid-April, he was a member of the BTF for the City for the entire two years. He said that he has been on a couple of other Broadband Task Force\u2019s in other communities and he has worked on broadband projects around the United States and other countries. He said that it is something that is near and dear to his heart. He stated that for those who are familiar with the BTF recommendations, it focuses on a few things. One is an enormous challenge to be focused enough to get really useful information. He said that the initial study by Tilson was quite good but very broad and wide and did not have the level of detail needed to understand the cost/benefits and tradeoffs that would be part of a municipal broadband project. He said that the BTF recommendation was fairly specific in the analysis. He said that digital equity was found by the BTF to be the #1 priority for the city. He said that the Digital Equity Study underway will bring forward a lot of information. He noted that the study has taken longer than anticipated but the results will be valuable. He said that Covid has been a global case study for those working around broadband and internet access. He said that there was decent data regarding the gaps in communities that are not well-served but whether it was student aged children, older residents wanting to connect with families in other states, or people working remotely, people have been using high bandwidth applications to accomplish those things. That means that while the Digital Equity Study had to be changed in some way, they were able to zero in on greater detail about connectivity issues for various purposes we will all benefit from having much more detail. He said that digital equity and municipal broadband are two important topics to look at. They are not one in the same. He said that a municipal broadband network can have many benefits. He said that it is not necessarily the fastest route to digital equity nor will it fully address digital equity unless that is part of the mandate. As it relates to the complexity of broadband, Mr. McCormick said that it is important to know exactly what benefits we are looking to achieve through a municipal broadband network. Another dimension is around business models. He said that there are many to choose from and he recommended that this must be narrowed down. There are always opinions that wireless is getting better and that it may mitigate the need for high speed fiber connectivity. He said that we should zero in on something specific. Lastly, we must incorporate what are the principals that matter most to Cambridge. Mr. McCormick said that the study needs to look at cost and financing, understanding that this is a major capital investment as well as a major operating cost. Lastly, we must look at revenue model and how is it sustainable. He said that he is excited to pick up where the BTF left off. Lee Gianetti said that as it relates to next steps in the process, the City is looking to conduct focused analysis regarding municipal broadband. The analysis will incorporate the goals of the BTF and the policy goals regarding broadband that the City Council has adopted. He explained that the findings that are beginning to emerge from the Digital Equity Study will also inform the work. He said that the city will be seeking analysis of cost, benefits, and risks of a municipal broadband system to allow the City to make informed decisions moving forward. Clarity around the question of what is the goal is a critical piece moving forward. Mr. Gianetti said that the City will be seeking to collect sufficient quantitative information that will allow the City to determine whether and how to pursue an appropriate municipal broadband network that could meet the City\u2019s goals. They will be seeking a model for how Cambridge can deal with digital inclusiveness and to achieve goals of the City Council and the BTF. He stated the need significant community outreach and interest in the proposed solution. He said that it was something that came up regularly and it is important to engage the community in the process. Specific tasks that will be sought will include a needs gap analysis, an evaluation of network solution, a financial feasibility analysis and funding model, and a detailed marketing analysis which will be critical to look at to determine whether a solution is viable to move onto the next step which would involve developing the overall parameters for a system to help the City assess capital and operating costs, interconnections, insurance, bandwidth, legal requirements, other costs to operate a network as well as the City\u2019s ability to provide operational support. He said that a comment made by a BTF member has stuck in head, \u201cWe don\u2019t have engineering problem, we have a goal problem.\u201d Mr. Gianetti said it comes down to what is it that we are trying to do and what problem are we trying to solve. He said that as the City looks at finalizing a scope of work for an RFP, it would be helpful to have more clarity from the City Council on what the expectations are. He said that there have been various approaches and goals described in different meetings and it will be helpful to understand from a City Council perspective what are the goals and what are the acceptable parameters for analysis. He said that public commenters have spoken about issues around the ownership of a system and what does that mean. He said the he hopes to have a high level conversation around various broadband approaches, what types of background information the City can provide the City Council, and at the next meeting they can come back with a specific proposal and provide an update on what was learned through the data gathered with the Digital Equity Study. He said that the data gathering phase is completed and consultants are working on the recommendation part of the report. Councillor Nolan thanked all City staff. Councillor Carlone made a motion to close Public Comment. The roll was called and resulted as follows: YEAS: Councillor Nolan, Councillor Carlone, Vice Mayor Mallon, Councillor McGovern, Councillor Zondervan -5 NAYS: -0 ABSENT: -0 and Public Comment was closed. Councillor Nolan stated that she appreciates the City moving forward and she would like to hold the balance of frustration of all who have been waiting for this for years. She said that would have been pleased to have this in place when the pandemic hit. She said that the BTF finished its work four years ago and if it would have been feasible, the City could have been doing that now. She said that 700 cities have networks and we are behind the curve instead of ahead of the curve. She said that she wants the City to be diligent. She reminded people that the City is in the process of developing the scopes of services and they want to hear what the vision is, what are the goals and to give input to come back and have a more specific set of scope of services. Councillor Zondervan stated that he is frustrated but is pleased that the conversation is happening. He stated that he sponsored a Policy Order detailing some of the priorities that should be looked at. One main priority was a digital equity study which the City has been engaged in. He said that we seem to be operating in this model where we assume that this has to be fee for service. He said that there are a lot of reasons to question that. He said that one of the simplest examples is our streets. He said that we do not charge people to drive on our streets and that facilitates all the commerce and activities that happen in the city. He said that the broadband concept is the digital road to the 21st century. He said that if we limit thinking to the idea that we have to charge people for service, it does not allow us to fully explore the possibility of equity. He asked why couldn\u2019t we have a model where people who move to Cambridge have access to the internet. He said that this does not mean its free, just as our roads are paid through taxes or other revenue sources. He said that it does not have to be fee for service. He said that the City could charge fees to corporations and large users. He said that for residents using basic infrastructure, we could explore possibility that it does not have to be a fee for service model. Councillor Zondervan said that as it relates to infrastructure and putting infrastructure in roads as they are being rebuilt, we see the utility companies put infrastructure in the road but we have not been willing to put in municipal broadband infrastructure in at the same time. He said that there is no technology that we are aware of that can move data faster than the speed of light. He said that installing fiber optics in the streets is a no-lose proposition. He said that the city should look at beginning to put in place infrastructure so that when we decide how to run it, we already have fiber in place in the streets so there would not be further delays. As it relates to the Digital Equity Study, Vice Mayor Mallon asked when the City Council might expect the full Digital Equity Study to be prepared and presented to the City Council. Mr. Gianetti said that he would be happy to give a presentation regarding the findings from the Digital Equity Study at the next hearing. He said that the consultants may be able to participate in that hearing. As part of the data gathering the city has done a city-wide mail survey as well as a targeted randomized mail survey. Mr. Gianetti said that the CHA has undertaken stakeholder interviews with experts, providers, service groups and residents. This is building a big picture of what are the actual problems and needs. He said that there is a big difference in the citywide survey and the CHA survey. He said that there is a bigger digital divide issue in the CHA with families in CHA housing. He said that this is where it will help inform the City as it puts together the scope for the RFP and how to prioritize this issue. He said that the report will be wrapped up by the end of November/early December. Mr. Gianetti noted that the City received the results from the CHA two weeks ago. Vice Mayor Mallon asked if consultants will be ready in one month\u2019s time to share initial findings and thoughts. Mr. Gianetti answered in the affirmative. Vice Mayor Mallon said she appreciates how digital inequity affects the community during a pandemic. She said that during Covid crisis, the most hard hit are low income residents. She noted that her priority is ensuring that the most vulnerable residents have access to high speed internet at low to no cost. She said that the City must seize every opportunity where we can create policies and programs for those most struggling and vulnerable. She said that this includes students. She said that she agrees that it is not a money problem, it is a goals problem. Councillor McGovern said that it has been said that municipal broadband is a way that we can address the digital divide, but not necessarily the only way. He noted that if the City decided today to move towards municipal broadband, it would be many years before anything would be up and running. He said that maybe we should look at ways to address the digital divide that is not about municipal broadband. He said that he would like to have some sense of a timeline and what would be done in the meantime to ensure that people have access as soon as possible. He said that we should further refine actual goals to ensure that we are moving in the right direction. How do we ensure that we have a reliable, high speed, cost efficient service that everyone can afford and has access to that provides the bandwidth that people need today and into the future? Councillor Carlone said that there is a great amount of study that has taken place. He said that as Vice Mayor Mallon and Councillor McGovern have said, his priority is that the government as the vehicle to serve people who do not have anyone serving them. He said that the cost has greatly outpaced inflation to people and Comcast is a highly profitable business. He said that there is enormous information that has not been fully shared. He agrees that this could have been done a lot sooner. He said that he remembers conversations in 2014 and 2015 about rebuilding roads in West Cambridge and not installing conduit for future use seems ignorant. He said that the cost of putting in the conduit is 90% of the cost versus the 10% of the cable. He said that he considers the Port as an example where much of the roads will be rebuilt so we should be putting in conduit for a future system. He noted that the key point to him is helping those who need it the most, including seniors who do not have the funds to pay increased taxes or cable. He said Santa Monica is a huge success and we are light years behind. Mayor Siddiqui said that City Council allocated $50,000 in the interim for students and Comcast coupon codes. She said that knowing how many families utilized this service and hotspots would be helpful. Councillor Nolan stated that she is interested to read the Benton Report which she will share with her colleagues on the City Council. She said that it is about public and private partnerships in 2020 referencing the pandemic and one model that can be used in municipal broadband. She said that it talks about the emerging model and she is interested to see the City reference that. She suggested that the City sit down with Upgrade Cambridge and/or brought back a task force as the scope of services is developed. Mr. Gianetti said that they have not engaged members of the community, but he will confer with Mr. McCormick to see how to engage people during the development phase. Councillor Nolan said that we must build on work that has already been done and it would be great to reach out to Upgrade Cambridge who has galvanized thousands of people across the city so that this will be a truly inclusive process. She said that her goal is to have a network across the entire city. She stated that she would like to ensure that the goal for Cambridge is to provide better service across the city with true inclusion and equity. She said that people could pay various amounts but with quality service. She suggested outreach to look at other models asked if any of those models will be incorporated into the scope of services. Councillor asked if we are including for best practice ideas. Mr. McCormick responded that they would be looking at different models. He said that he agrees that the majority of municipal broadband networks are fee for service. He said that in general, if many residents and businesses are willing to pay a similar price to what they pay now for better service then that would allow room for some means tested effort to have a more affordable service of equal quality for those most vulnerable. He noted that you would need sufficient revenue to balance off subsidized services. He said that you would also need the take rate to be high enough to make it work. He stated that one challenge is that municipal broadband is some version of a natural monopoly. He said that there is nothing preventing another provider from coming into Cambridge. We do not have an exclusive arrangement with Comcast to build a network. There is a high cost associated with building a network. These are very important elements to a study to understand the cost and feasibility to allow us to sustainably to operate in both the capital investment and operating costs. Vice Mayor Mallon stated that she would like members of city staff to meet with Upgrade Cambridge because there are benefits to have this group weigh in. She asked if there should be a motion that city staff meet with members of Upgrade Cambridge prior to the next hearing to ensure that they are represented on the RFP. She said that sometimes small businesses pay thousands of dolls for internet service. She asked if the city reached out to small businesses in the digital equity survey. Mr. McCormick said that the DES did not look at business service, only residential. Vice Mayor Mallon asked if there is any data around small business internet connectivity and cost? Mr. Gianetti responded that he will investigate that and if that is a gap area, they will talk to consultants on the small business piece. Vice Mayor Mallon said that small businesses have been hit hard by Covid and this could keep and attract small business owners. She said that any data or study that we have on cost to small businesses will be helpful. As it relates to the City providing Comcast free of charge to students for 12 months, Vice Mayor Mallon said that she agrees that municipal broadband is not the quickest way to solve the digital equity problem, but this could be a bridge to low income residents and seniors and students. As it relates to the Benton Report, Vice Mayor Mallon said that she wonders if the City Council could include in the RFP the exploration of a PPP model for moving forward. Vice Mayor Mallon asked if a motion should be made to have the City the Committee should make a motion to have the City team meet with Upgrade Cambridge around goals for the RFP prior to the next hearing. Louis DePasquale responded that he will happy to do so and will reach out to Upgrade Cambridge as soon as possible. Councillor Nolan stated that makes sense given the timing. Councillor Zondervan said that small businesses can be considered part of the residential customers in terms of broadband. He said that in a sense, just like the roads, a municipal broadband system is a national monopoly because it does not make a lot of sense to have duplicate cables running under the street competing with each other to move the information. He said that if we stay stuck in a fee for service model, we are limiting ourselves in terms of what we can be achieved. He said that a lot of other places that have been looked, did not have real access for residents. Essentially, they had guaranteed customers. He said that in Cambridge it is more complicated because we do have Comcast and they provide some level of internet service. Verizon provides a different internet service as well. He said that if we change the paradigm and treat it more like the roads and put the infrastructure in place and it is taxpayer funded and everyone has equal access to it then it opens up a lot more opportunity for us to ensure true equity of access. He said that fee for service does not need to be the only option. He said that we have known about the digital divide for many years and have been unwilling to confront the issue. He concluded by stating that there is a lot of opportunity to address these issues. Councillor Carlone said that it is interesting that the City Council is strongly pushing this issue. He said that he does a lot of reading on urban history and infrastructure is a key part of that. He asked Mr. McCormick if we are aware of a different kind of breakthrough in communication. If not, this becomes more pressing because everyday matters. He asked if there is there some advancement that is worth waiting for or is this as good as it is going to get? Mr. McCormick said that the internet for the near future is here to stay for various communication needs. In terms of the way you access the internet, there is always a debate of wireless, for example, catching up. He said that today\u2019s big debate is around 5G. Over time, it will offer faster speeds than we are used to via wireless. He said that fiber is the best way to have connectivity. He explained that fiber operates close to the speed of light and the hardware on the fiber cable can be upgraded without replacing the cable itself. He expects that we will get higher speeds from fiber cables even as wireless tries to catch up Councillor Zondervan said that terms of competition, he did not mean to suggest that there is no competition but that the situation is different when there are well established players and we are trying to compete with them versus when there are a lot of customers who are available either because we are able to offer a much improved level of service or because they simply don\u2019t have access to broadband. He said that if the model is limited to \u201cCan we compete with Comcast?\u201d we may well talk ourselves out of offering municipal broadband which would be a huge mistake. In response to Councillor Carlone\u2019s question to Mr. McCormick, he added that the known laws of physics do not allow for faster transmission of information than the speed of light so it is unlikely that we will find better than fiber cable. Councillor Nolan said that Loveland, Colorado had a lot of competitors. She said that her go to would be Chattanooga, Tennessee. She said that it is a totally different place and yet the fact that after they did municipal broadband the State of Tennessee forbid it. It wasn\u2019t because it wasn\u2019t working it was because it was working so well that they understood that they were going to prevent other municipalities from doing it. She said that the City should be at the forefront of this. She said that the City has stood in favor of net neutrality and open access. She asked if this is something that the City needs direction on as it relates to being an important element. She said that her understanding is that separate from this, the City Council has passed resolutions in favor of ensuring that neutrality and open access. Mr. Gianetti responded that the city has received clear direction from the Committee on those issues. Councillor Nolan asked Mr. Gianetti if enough information has been gleaned from the Committee. Mr. Gianetti replied that the City has received everything that is needed for follow-up steps. Mr. McCormack thanked all for input. He said that we are collectively close to the recommendation that was made by the BTF. He said that the conversation with Upgrade Cambridge will be another opportunity to test a gap analysis against that. Councillor Nolan thanked all those present for their attendance. Councillor Carlone made a motion to adjourn. The roll was called and resulted as follows: YEAS: Councillor Nolan, Councillor Carlone, Vice Mayor Mallon, Councillor McGovern, Councillor Zondervan -5 NAYS: -0 ABSENT: -0 and the hearing was adjourned at 3:43 p.m. For the Committee, ________________________________ Councillor Patricia Nolan, Chair Neighborhood & Long-Term Planning; Public Facilities, Arts and Celebrations Committee",

The popular projects will expand to include self-guided historical walking tours of Central Square in order to help facilitate foot traffic for small businesses that remain open. Collaboration with existing community groups, such as Cambridge Black Trailblazers, and the History Project, will also be enhanced in order to include oral history audio and video clips as part of the walking tours of both Inman and Central Squares. There will also be an adapted guide aimed at middle and high school age youth and those involved virtually with city-run after school programs as well as the expansion of a deck of playing cards highlighting Cambridge women who have contributed to our communities.

I am pleased to announce the appointment of the Cambridge Advisory Committee on City Art, Memorials and Markers. This Committee, as requested in Awaiting Report Item Number 19-74, will review public monuments, memorials, and markers throughout Cambridge \u201cto determine whether any of these commemorate those who were linked to the slave trade or engaged in other similarly shameful acts, (and) to determine which individuals - particularly women, people of color, and those from other historically marginalized communities - should be newly recognized.\u201d The Council Order recommended that the Committee \u201creview and borrow\u201d from the template that New York City <https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/monuments/downloads/pdf/mac-monuments-report.pdf> recently established for a similar effort to review, assess, and update their own public monuments, memorials, and public art. In summary, we expect the work of the Committee to: (1) develop recommendations to the City Manager and City Council on how the City should address City-owned monuments and markers, (2) develop procedures for review and assessment of those which may be viewed as inconsistent with the values of Cambridge, by which we mean a just City that prioritizes anti-racism, equity, diversity, and inclusion, and (3) make recommendations for how to determine which individuals or events might be newly recognized with a monument/public art, memorial or marker. Cambridge Advisory Committee on City Art, Monuments and Markers: \u00b7 E. Denise Simmons, City Councillor and Chair of the Civic Unity Committee \u00b7 Greggy Bazile, Artist/Muralist, Senior at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, interested in Architecture and Public spaces, Cambridge resident \u00b7 Brian Corr, Executive Director of the Peace Commission and Police Review & Advisory Board \u00b7 Melvin Downes, Jr., Black Trailblazers representative, The Cambridge Black History Project.

Cambridge resident \u00b7 Dr. Janie Ward, Simmons University, Professor and Chair, Department of Africana Studies and Education. Cambridge resident The work of this Committee will involve developing criteria and frameworks for evaluating memorials and markers, which will also inform future considerations by the City in regard to Awaiting Report Item Number 19-45, regarding streets, schools and public buildings. Meetings of the Committee will be open to the Public and held virtually on Zoom. We also expect there to be additional public feedback opportunities to better understand, in particular, what and whom residents would like to see represented in future memorials and public art. The work will commence in January and is expected to take 6 months.",

I am forwarding for your consideration a Home Rule Petition seeking special legislation from the Legislature which would authorize the City of Cambridge to provide police, fire and other emergency services (\u201cEmergency Services\u201d) to portions of the Cambridge Crossing project that are partially located in the cities of Boston and Somerville, with one such property wholly located within Somerville. As you know, Cambridge Crossing is a large mixed-use project situated on over 45 acres of land located in the cities of Cambridge, Boston and Somerville, and containing residential, office, laboratory and retail uses (the \u201cProject\u201d). Portions of the Project are not accessible by streets located in either Boston or Somerville and are only accessible by emergency responders by streets located in the City of Cambridge. The laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts generally prohibit municipalities from providing emergency services to properties located outside of their municipal boundaries. While there are certain exceptions for instances of mutual aid, the municipality in which a specific parcel of real estate is located is generally responsible for the provision of police, fire and other emergency services to such parcels and the buildings located on the parcels and the occupants of those buildings. In addition, Massachusetts law prevents municipalities from assessing taxes or other municipal charges against properties not situated within its municipal boundaries. Therefore, the special legislation that is enclosed here also would authorize the City to impose fees on the owner of any parcel located within the Project for the provision of these Emergency Services.",

The median wealth of white families is more than $100,000 while the median wealth of black families is approximately $10,000; and WHEREAS: The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these wealth gaps across race and gender, [disproportionally affecting people of color](https://www.msn.com/en- us/news/politics/how-covid-19-exacerbated-america-s-wealth-gap/ar-BB164lm2); and WHEREAS: In order to address these inequalities, a coalition of [Mayors across the country](https://www.mayorsforagi.org/who) \u2013 from Oakland, CA to Gainseville, FL \u2013 have committed to advocating in favor of cash-based guaranteed income policies; and WHEREAS: Cambridge has also signed onto the Mayor\u2019s for a Guaranteed Income Pledge and is actively working with community partners to pilot a universal basic income program in Cambridge in early 2021; and WHEREAS: Ongoing, direct cash payments will put real money in the pockets of people across the country and increase spending in our communities; and WHEREAS: These regular payments have shown to be more effective than unemployment benefits for families of color. The data show that another direct payment would increase Native American, Latinx/Hispanic, and Black family income by 4.1%, 3.9%, and 3.6% respectively, compared to 2% of household income for white families; and WHEREAS: Providing an income floor that would support families during this economic and public health crisis will benefit those individuals receiving ongoing cash assistance and the community at large; now therefore be it RESOLVED: That the Cambridge City Council go on record supporting the efforts of the Mayor\u2019s for A Guaranteed Income and supports ongoing, direct cash payments throughout the pandemic and until our economy recovers; and be it further RESOLVED: That the Cambridge City Council urges President-elect Biden, Speaker Pelosi and Leader McConnell to develop an ongoing federal guaranteed income that provides an income floor for all Americans.",

The roll was called and resulted as follows: PRESENT: Councillor Simmons, Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler, Vice Mayor Mallon and Councillor McGovern -4 ABSENT: Councillor Zondervan -1 A quorum was present. Councillor Simmons read from a prepared written opening statement (ATTACHMENT A). She then invited Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler for his opening remarks. Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler stated that Cambridge is facing an affordable housing crisis. He said that there are parts that must be addressed via state and federal funding. He said that Inclusionary Housing preferences are under the control of the City Council, that this is a tangible step that can be taken on the local level, and that he is excited to hear this evening\u2019s presentation. Councillor Simmons noted that the Housing Committee received a communication from Kavish Gandhi and asked that this communication be made part of the permanent record of the hearing. Councillor Simmons opened the hearing to Public Comment. Heather Hoffman, 213 Hurley Street, stated that she is glad to see this issue getting some attention. She said that she wondered whether an additional item could be considered: she said that she knows numerous people who live in Inclusionary units who have wanted to take in a homeless person (people whom they already know) to live with them, but have been prevented from doing so because of the existing rules. She said that this would be a more efficient use of the housing that we have available, and she hopes that the City Council considers changing the rules to allow this, if it is found to be legal to do so. She said this change in the rules could help some people to not be homeless. James Williamson, 1000 Jackson Place, stated that he did not have any comment prior to viewing the presentation by CDD. Councillor Simmons stated that Public Comment will remain open until 6:00 p.m. Councillor Simmons invited Chris Cotter to introduce the City team for this hearing. He stated that Justine Cabrera and Linda Prosnitz from the Community Development Department were joining in on tonight\u2019s meeting, as well as Maura Pensak, the Housing Liaison to the City Manager, and City Solicitor Nancy Glowa. He said that they are all happy to continue the conversation. He said that his department has spent a long time working on the Inclusionary recommendations with the Affordable Housing Trust, and they are pleased to present these recommendations to the Housing Committee tonight and to receive feedback. Mr. Cotter said that when thinking about potentially changing preferences, we unavoidably advantage some and disadvantage others. He said it is a very challenging thing to do. He said that his team has been able to talk and work with feedback they\u2019ve been given in order to revise these preferences. He said that the Affordable Housing Trust was building off of what they had previously heard from the City Council. Mr. Cotter gave an overview of a PowerPoint presentation titled Inclusionary Housing Resident Selection Preferences. (ATTACHMENT B). As Mr. Cotter wrapped up his presentation, he said that he looks forward to getting comments and feedback on this during and following this hearing. He said that the next steps would be for his team to put this material into draft standards and procedures for resident selection. He said this would then be looked at by the Law Department. He said that they want to expand the documentation requirements for residents, that there would be a revised and updated document explaining how we define what a resident is and what the City would accept for documentation, and that the CDD has heard from staff, from residents, and from the Council that they want to give applicants more choices and opportunities to confirm their residency. He said they will put this document together in such a way that is consistent with the Ordinance, and then this would be put into a draft form for Public Comment. That Public Comment period would need to be at least 30 days, it would be shared with all applicants, with residents, with building managers, and with anyone with a stake in the program to solicit their feedback. Following that process, the Trust would then review that feedback, process through it into a final draft, which would then become effective in changing the preference system. Councillor Simmons thanked Mr. Cotter and then asked about the \u201cNext Steps\u201d slide of the presentation. She asked if the draft recommendations go to the Affordable Housing Trust, then to the Law Department, and then back to the Housing Committee before going to the City Council? She said it was not quite clear to her. Chris Cotter said that there is no formal role for the Affordable Housing Trust in adopting any of these changes under the Inclusionary Ordinance. He said that under the Ordinance, it is the Community Development Department that has the authority to make these changes, with policy input from the City Council. He said that the CDD would draft standards and procedures for the Inclusionary Program, they would then put them out for Public Comment for 30 days; following that, the CDD would adapt based on the feedback they received, and then the CDD would issue final standards and procedures. He said that the next steps are for the Community Development Department to draft, in consultation with the Law Department, the document to ensure that it is being responsive to the requested changes, while adhering to the law. Mr. Cotter said that the Community Development Department certainly could come back and present these proposed final draft changes to the Housing Committee if that is requested. He said that the CDD understands the desire for this process to move forward quickly, and that it would likely take at least a couple of months. He said that we are currently talking about the general policy approach, but there are many details that need to be ironed out as it related to \u201cresidents.\u201d Councillor Simmons concurred that it would be a good idea to have the CDD come back and present this to the Housing Committee at least one more time prior to finalizing it. Councillor McGovern made a motion to close Public Comment. The roll was called and resulted as follows: YEAS: Councillor Simmons, Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler, Vice Mayor Mallon, Councillor McGovern and Councillor Zondervan -5 NAYS: -0 and Public Comment was closed. Councillor McGovern asked Mr. Cotter to discuss Slide #3, \u201cNumber of Applicants.\u201d He asked, of the 2,322 applicants who are classified as non- resident/non-worker, if we know how many formerly resided in Cambridge. Mr. Cotter replied that there is no way to know that, as it is not criteria included in our applications. Councillor McGovern said that to get a true sense of the list, in terms of which applicants have Cambridge ties, his preference would be to see someone who formerly lived in Cambridge and had to move out because of rising rents now have the ability to come back to Cambridge. Regarding the list that has the breakdown by unit \u2013 which is based on the total of 3,243 applicants \u2013 Councillor McGovern asked if we know how many of the 921 Cambridge applicants want a 1 bedroom, or a 2 bedroom? Mr. Cotter said that we know for the 683 applicants \u2013 of those, we have roughly 100 applicants in the 1 bedroom pool, with the balance evenly split between the 2 and 3 bedroom pool. Councillor McGovern said that this is important, because this makes it look like the majority of applicants want a 1 or 2 bedroom, but if just broken down by Cambridge residents, that may not actually be the case. Mr. Cotter responded by saying that in some ways, what\u2019s more readily available can actually drive the applicants, using the example that we know 3 bedroom units in this program are rare, and thus we do not see as many people applying for 3 bedroom units (because many would-be applicants realize how challenging it would be to obtain a 3 bedroom unit and therefore they do not apply for the program). Councillor McGovern said that, for the Cambridge residents out of that pool of 683 applicants, 100 are waiting for a 1 bedroom and the rest are waiting for either a 2 bedroom or a 3 bedroom, and that is a different breakdown than what is shown on Slide 3. Councillor McGovern said that on this slide, it looks like most applicants are waiting for 1 bedroom units. Mr. Cotter said that this reflects the fact that the program is able to serve 1 bedroom applicants more quickly, and we don\u2019t typically get to the non-Cambridge residents. He said that the program sees the most unmet demand in family sized units. Councillor McGovern said that he really wants to prioritize the program for people who are in Cambridge and have been here, as opposed to applicants with no previous ties to Cambridge and who may never have set foot in Cambridge. In regards to the emergency designation based around homelessness, Councillor McGovern has had to say to people who are unhoused and are couch surfing that they must spend a couple nights in a shelter so they can qualify as being homeless. He said that it is awful to tell someone that this is what they must do. He asked if we have thought about the couch-surfing issue, and is there a way to include those people as emergency homeless applicants? Mr. Cotter said that as we think about changes and developing more details, the Trust has talked about trying to be more expansive in terms of how homeless applicants are looked at. He said that the concern is that it becomes an easy threshold to meet, if we simply take people at their word that they\u2019ve been couch surfing, and then everyone now meets this emergency criteria. He said that the Trust has talked about looking at expanding the types of resources that they rely on to confirm that someone is homeless, such as looking at if they\u2019re working with a service provider, or with a social worker. Councillor McGovern said that he does still worry about the \u201ccliff effect\u201d where someone living in an Inclusionary unit has the opportunity to get a raise at work, and if they accept the raise they make just enough money to now be just over income, and they no longer qualify for the Inclusionary Housing program, but they don\u2019t make enough money to rent a non-subsidized unit, nor enough to buy a unit. He asked if there is any way to address that issue, and is it as big an issue as he believes it is. Mr. Cotter said that the CDD does see this from time to time, but it is not an overwhelming issue to the extent that it is brought to the CDD\u2019s attention. He said that for the home ownership program, there is no ceiling in terms of income eligibility once a person has signed on to the program and has purchased a unit. In terms of the Inclusionary Rental program, he said that there is a built in cushion in the ordinance for a tenant to remain eligible, and to the extent that an Inclusionary tenant\u2019s income extends over 100 percent AMI, which has happened on occasion, then CDD works with those people to look at their options, and they have had success on a case-by-case basis. Councillor McGovern said that it is important to let people know about this, as there may be many cases where it doesn\u2019t reach the attention of the CDD because tenants facing that raise that places them just above the income threshold ultimately decide not to take the job, for fear of jeopardizing their housing. Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler said that, in terms of feedback, he agreed with Councillor McGovern\u2019s points in needing to expand how we define homelessness and the documentation that is accepted. He said that we must explore giving additional weight to emergency housing needs. He said that we must prevent more people from getting priced out of Cambridge. We should also make sure we are increasing information to applicants and current participants, and we also need to increase the information to applicants about income changes they may experience during their wait. Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler asked how the CDD looks at preferences from other affordable housing providers in Cambridge, and how changing the Inclusionary preferences can be done to possibly meet the needs that are not being met by those other housing providers. For example, he cited that military veterans are given the same weighted preference at the Cambridge Housing Authority whether they come from Cambridge or whether they applied from out of state; if the veterans preference is already being addressed by the CHA, he asked if there might be other preferences that we could be addressing here. Mr. Cotter confirmed that some of the emergency criteria is more in line with what the CHA has in their criteria, but the CDD has kept some things that CHA does not have. He said the big difference is the preference for families with children, and this is not a typical preference that is seen. Mr. Cotter said that, by and large, our preference system is about as complex as one will find; in the CHA, you either get local preference or you don\u2019t, but in the Inclusionary program there is a graduated approach that is pretty complicated. Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler asked if there is a way to have a preference for people that grew up in affordable housing. Mr. Cotter responded that it is something that has been discussed. He said that most residency preferences are either live in or work in the community. He said that moving away from this could begin to create questions of fair housing. The advice the CDD has had is to not have preferences that require some duration of time, or time limited preference, or something that looks back very far into a person\u2019s housing history. He said that the CDD is now looking to include provisions that would include former residents. Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler said that he would like to think about changes where, if you have a family member or friend that you can stay with, but if you grew up in affordable housing and cannot go back to your family, it should be addressed. He said that he would be happy to follow up on this thread at a later time. Councillor Zondervan stated that this is a complex problem, and we clearly have a huge need for emergency housing. He stated that one of the things that he is seeing are cases where someone who was a Cambridge resident 4-5 years ago is now homeless, and how do we better address the needs of these people. Mr. Cotter said that in cases of someone who is homeless and whose last permanent address was in Cambridge, they would get the benefit of the preference. Councilor Zondervan said that he would appreciate an early look at some of the more detailed definitions of \u201cresident\u201d and of \u201chomeless\u201d that CDD comes up with. In terms of the point system for emergency housing, Councilor Zondervan said that he appreciates the effort into looking into this. He asked if it reasonable to try to increase the weight of the homeless preference, in some way. Mr. Cotter responded that the CDD is happy to get the feedback on the weighing of the various points, and they want to hear from the City Council on what the priorities were. In terms of emergency housing, they have tried to allow the emergency need to surpass the preference for veterans and families with children. He said that the question is more about the residency. With applicants that are homeless, he said that they try to look at the whole picture. Councillor Zondervan said that he appreciates the difficulty of the challenge. With regards to better serving those with Cambridge ties who are currently homeless, Councillor Zondervan mused that there may be a way to better align the CDD\u2019s criteria with the criteria utilized by the local shelters to confirm someone as being a Cambridge resident. Vice Mayor Mallon stated that there are people in emergency situations that could be affected by potential changes. Regarding the list that was shown by Mr. Cotter, she said it would be helpful to have it broken out by bedroom type and by Cambridge residents versus non-residents. In terms of recently displaced former residents, she asked what documentation is going to be needed? Mr. Cotter said that they try to be flexible, and they might look at a past lease, a past utility bill, and a range of other options. Vice Mayor Mallon asked if the CDD had any idea what additional documentation may be considered in proving residency. Mr. Cotter said that they are in the process of discussing how they might expand residency documentation, and they are trying to give people more choices in documentation. He said that they might consider weighting different documents to provide greater flexibility. He said that CDD has been looking to other housing programs and other cities to look at different models, and this is still being developed. Vice Mayor Mallon thanked Mr. Cotter for this work so far, and she looks forward to the next part of this process. Mayor Siddiqui said that this has come a long way since June of 2019, and many suggestions of the City Council have been incorporated. She said that, with regards to documentation to homelessness, many families who are couch surfing are in touch with City departments, such as the Mayor\u2019s Office or the Multi Service Center, and she suggests that perhaps we broaden the scope to include people that have worked been working with City departments or agencies as proof of homelessness. Councillor Simmons asked Mr. Cotter, regarding Slide 7: when the CDD is looking at former residents who met residency requirements at time of application, are we speaking to those who hold a mobile voucher? Mr. Cotter said yes and no. He said that the CDD had recommended, in the last meeting, to preserve residency status of any applicant in the program as long as they have an active application. This means that if someone lived in Cambridge when they applied to the program, they then are forced out of the City, and then their name reaches to the top of the list, they will be still be treated as a Cambridge resident because they were a resident at the time of applying. Mr. Cotter said that this is the change that CDD thinks will most dramatically affect resident applicants. He said that the second piece involves Cambridge residents who are issued a voucher, cannot find a unit in Cambridge, and secure a unit outside the City in order to keep their voucher active. Mr. Cotter that the new change being recommended is that these people, who have been displaced from Cambridge, would be able to apply for an Inclusionary Unit for up to one year after leaving Cambridge and they will still be treated as Cambridge residents, and this will be a big boost to giving these people the opportunity to move back to the City. Councillor Simmons said that she was happy to see the new veteran status. In terms of emergency need, she asked where domestic violence survivors fall in these criteria. Mr. Cotter said that on page 10, victims of domestic violence are listed. He said that the CDD wants to have the appropriate definitions in place, but they have allowed some flexibility for applicants to meet the criteria. Regarding time-limited transitional housing, Councillor Simmons asked if this housing wouldn\u2019t necessarily have to be in Cambridge. Mr. Cotter said that someone living outside of Cambridge would get that preference, but would not necessarily get the residency preference. He said that CDD would look at the address of the person prior to entering transitional housing. Councillor Simmons said that some victims of domestic violence have their address embargoed for safety purposes, and we would not want this to be an impediment to their getting housed. Mr. Cotter said that this is something that can be looked at when planning out how to establish criteria for that preference. Councillor Simmons then asked Mike Johnston or Maura Pensak for comments. Maura Pensak stated that she does not have anything to add, but that she appreciates the work of CDD and she appreciates expanding emergency and residency requirements, and recognizing the need of folks with children over the age of six having high priority. She looks forward to the next steps of this process. Mike Johnston stated that Mr. Cotter and his staff have done a great job, he thinks this is a great piece of work, and he looks forward to seeing it put in place. Councillor Simmons thanked Mr. Cotter and his staff, she said that this has been a long time getting to this place and she wants this issue to be expedited. She invited the Housing Committee members to put into writing any additional questions that they may have and she will have this material forwarded to Mr. Cotter. Councillor Simmons summarized her understanding that Mr. Cotter will now take recommendations and thoughts from the Housing Committee and work to update the guidelines, there will then be a 30 day period of Public Comment, then this will be brought back to the Housing Committee. She said that having a written timeline submitted to the committee would be helpful. Mr. Cotter confirmed that the next steps are to take what has been presented tonight and develop draft standards and procedures. He said he will share that with the City Council, and the schedule will include a 30 day public review comment process. He said that we will want to comply with the ordinance, and this will be mapped out. Councillor Simmons asked that Mr. Cotter get a timeline for the standards and procedures and then sit with the Housing Committee Co-Chairs to ensure that it fits with the trajectory. She said she would like to receive a timeline and then work through and get back to the committee, and Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler concurred. Councillor Simmons thanked the Committee, she said she is excited to move the process forward, and she is committed to working as expeditiously as possible to move this along. Councillor Simmons and Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler thanked all those present for their attendance. On a motion by Vice Mayor Mallon to adjourn the hearing, the roll was called and resulted as follows: YEAS: Councillor Simmons, Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler, Vice Mayor Mallon, Councillor McGovern and Councillor Zondervan -5 NAYS: -0 And the meeting was adjourned at 7:30 p.m. For the Committee, ________________________________ Councillor E.

In response to Awaiting Report Item Number 19-134, regarding increasing funding to the City's HomeBridge program, Assistant City Manager for Community Development Iram Farooq reports the following: The City has worked with the Affordable Housing Trust to plan for expanding the HomeBridge program to serve homebuyers earning between 100% and 120% of area median income (AMI). The Affordable Housing Trust recently approved changes which will allow for this program expansion. HomeBridge is a component of the City\u2019s homebuyer assistance programs which offers direct funding to homebuyers purchasing homes on the market. Through HomeBridge, the City provides buyers with between 40% and 50% of their home purchase price. HomeBridge, and similar prior assistance programs, have been funded by the Trust with Community Preservation Act (CPA) funds. CPA funds can be used to assist households whose incomes are less than 100% AMI. Homes purchased with HomeBridge funding become part of the City\u2019s stock of deed- restricted affordable housing. At its meeting on November 19th, the Trust approved measures needed to expand HomeBridge to households earning up to 120% AMI. The Trust also approved $3 million in funding for households earning between 100% and 120% AMI, which is expected to serve at least 8 to 10 homebuyers. CDD is now planning for the launch of this new program component which is expected to be available in January.",

I am hereby requesting the appropriation of Federal CARES Act funds in the amount of $1,256,118 to the Public Investment Fund Community Development Department Extraordinary Expenditures account. This is the second round of funding that the City has received through The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, also known as the CARES Act; a law intended to address the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. The City plans on using the funds to assist residents and small business owners who are impacted by the virus, and to support emergency housing assistance efforts. Half of the funding ($628,059) will support the Small Business Relief Grants program. Funding will provide short term financial assistance to approximately 100 eligible businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The program provides grants of up to $6,000 and may be used for commercial mortgage/rent, inventory, payroll, or purchase of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). The other half of funding ($628,059) will support the continuation of the City of Cambridge COVID-19 Housing Stabilization program which provides up to 6 months of housing assistance to eligible Cambridge residents. These additional dollars will support approximately 150 households who have not already received 6 months of assistance through this program.",

I am hereby requesting the appropriation of $1,250,000 from Free Cash to the Public Investment Fund Emergency Communications Extraordinary Expense account. Funds will be used for site maintenance and the replacement of critical infrastructure to support the City of Cambridge radio system. This request will support a technology refresh for the replacement of all repeaters and transmitters. Replacement of all repeaters with identical gear is necessary for all sites to ensure connectivity with radios and infrastructure as well as IP based comparators for remote monitoring. Due to the design of the radio infrastructure, they all must be replaced at the same time to ensure operational continuity with make and models. In addition, site maintenance is required to ensure that there is sufficient back up power and that HVAC and grounding systems continue to operate effectively. Radio replacement and infrastructure funding was considered as part of the City\u2019s FY21 capital budget plan, but it was determined that a separate appropriation from Free Cash during the fiscal year was the best way to finance this equipment.",

I am hereby requesting the following two (2) appropriations related to the Foundry: 1) First, I am requesting an appropriation of $6.0 million from Free Cash to the Public Investment Fund Department of Public Works Extraordinary Expenditures Account; 2) Second, I am requesting an appropriation of $3.5 million received from the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority (CRA) to the Public Investment Fund Department of Public Works Extraordinary Expenditures Account. The total cost for the design and construction for the Foundry Building is now $45.5 million. This includes a total construction cost, or Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP), with our contractor, of $37.5 million; and design, administration and contingency costs of $8 million. This brings the City\u2019s total contribution for the design and construction of the Foundry to $35 million and the CRA\u2019s contribution to $10.5 million. (The CRA is also contributing an additional $500,000 for a total of $2.5 million to operating costs once the facility opens.) This is a substantial increase from the original budget estimates and a $9.5 million increase over our 50% construction estimates which were pre-pandemic. Unanticipated costs are related to the following factors: \u00b7 Significant structural deficiencies with the existing wood trusses, including possibly the need to replace the existing wood roof sheathing. \u00b7 The new structural steel frame for the interior floors and required seismic reinforcement of the building needed a more significant foundation system which requires significantly more removal of contaminated soil and installation of a vapor mitigation system required by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection to vent the underside of the floor slab. \u00b7 The publicly bid Trade Contractors were $2 million over estimates ($10 million vs. $8 million estimated) \u00b7 Additional costs for wood windows, the exterior metal panel selection, & interior woodwork. \u00b7 Roadway reconstruction on Rogers and Bent Street and a new intersection design at Rogers and Third Streets that is intended to help draw the public from Toomey Park and the intersection to the Foundry Building. The roadway and landscaping is presently estimated to be $2.2 million but is also actively being evaluated for cost reductions. Total additional cost now needed to complete this project is $9.5 million. We are actively exploring ways to reduce costs for this project, and any savings to the $37.5 million GMP will be returned to the City at the completion of the project. We expect to share this savings proportionately with the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority. I recommend your approval of these appropriations.",

I am hereby requesting the appropriation of $9,277,190 from Free Cash to the General Fund School Department Salaries and Wages account ($7,446,360), General Fund School Department Other Ordinary Maintenance account ($1,781,455), and General Fund School Department Travel and Training account ($49,375), to fund additional costs associated with the reopening of schools with health and safety mitigations related to COVID-19. The School Committee Order is attached. Re-opening schools during the COVID-19 global pandemic has required substantial investments in health and safety mitigations, as well as additional staff, technology and instructional supports. In total, the estimated costs related to preparing and operating the City\u2019s schools for the 2020-21 school year is $16.3 million. The School Department has identified approximately $7 million to fund these costs: $5.4 million in federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act funding and other grants; and $1.6 million in reallocated FY21 General Fund budget line items. In order to finance the balance of the estimated costs, an additional $9,277,190 is needed. Additional costs ($16.3M total) include: \u00b7 Health & Safety Expenses ($5.4 million) - including Personal Protective Equipment for staff and students; additional sinks for hand washing in school buildings; improvements related to the ventilation systems including air scrubbers with HEPA filters, box fans, window repairs, an engineering study and a planned project to implement the recommendations of the engineering study; on-site COVID-19 testing for staff two times per week; \u00b7 Additional School-based Staff ($6.5 million) - in order to support social distancing of 6 feet within classrooms and to address additional special education service requirements; \u00b7 Instructional Supports ($1.9 million) - including the Extended Learning Time program at the M.L. King School and Fletcher Maynard Academy; instructional materials sent home to students who are learning remotely; expanded summer programming; funding for planning time for teachers and paraprofessionals working in-person; \u00b7 Technology ($1.3 million) - Including additional Chromebooks (to ensure that every student has one); additional and expanded software licenses to support remote learning; system upgrades; Hot Spots for families; additional technology staff to support expanded technology and data needs; \u00b7 Planning & Engagement ($688K) - including educator Collaboratives; task force and working groups; school planning; principal and summer work; \u00b7 School Lunch Program ($470K) - The USDA has issued a waiver that allows the district to offer free meals to all students, not just those who qualify for Free/Reduced lunch. The additional costs in this category primarily reflect the estimated lost revenue from paid lunches. In addition, the Department has purchased additional equipment, including carts for transporting meals to classrooms and tablets for meal tracking during distribution.",

Chapter 39, Section 23D to allow members of adjudicatory boards and commissions to vote on a matter before the adjudicatory body of which they are a member if the board member has missed one of the sessions regarding the matter at issue. I am writing to ask for your approval to allow members of adjudicatory boards and commissions such as the Planning Board, the Board of Zoning Appeal, the Historical Commission, the Conservation Commission and the License Commission, among other adjudicatory bodies, to vote on a matter before the adjudicatory body of which they are a member if the board member has missed one of the sessions regarding the matter at issue. Chapter 39, Section 23D of the Massachusetts General Laws, known as the \u201cMullin Rule\u201d (see attached statutory language), provides that members of municipal boards or commissions who are absent from no more than one session of an adjudicatory hearing may still act on the matter at a future session, provided that the municipality accepts this section of the law and that the absent member reviews a transcript or video or audio recording of the hearing and certifies that they have done so. This statute is known as the Mullin Rule because it overturns in part a court case which had provided that only members present at all sessions of an adjudicatory hearing on a particular matter are eligible to vote on that matter. Mullin v. Planning Board of Brewster, 17 Mass.App.Ct. 139 (1983). On a number of past occasions, hearing sessions have needed to be postponed on short notice due to a member\u2019s unanticipated absence for illness or other reasons, causing inconvenience to members of the public and applicants. Acceptance of the Mullin Rule for adjudicatory boards and commissions in Cambridge would help to forestall some of these issues in the future. Therefore, I am hereby requesting that the City Council accept the provisions of G.L. c.39, \u00a723D. I look forward to discussing this matter with you and answering any questions you may have.",

DePasquale, City Manager, relative to the appropriation of $850,000 from Free Cash to the Public Investment Fund Public Works Department Extraordinary Expenditures account, for a 30 -Year Post Closure Evaluation and Report of Danehy Park. I am herby requesting an appropriation of $850,000 from Free Cash to the Public Investment Fund Public Works Department Extraordinary Expenditures account, for a 30 -Year Post Closure Evaluation and Report of Danehy Park. Danehy Park was opened in 1990 and is a 50-acre open space that provides sports fields, walking paths, a dog park, and other open space amenities for the community. Prior to its use as a city park, the area was predominately clay, and between 1847-1952, the clay was extracted to manufacture bricks by the New England Brick Company. The result was a deep clay pit that the City used as its landfill between 1952 and 1971. With the capping of the landfill and the creation of the Park in 1990, the city reclaimed what was a waste site and turned it into a significant community resource. Permitting of the site is managed through the MassDEP, Division of Solid Waste in order to ensure that the site is managed in a safe manner and that landfill gases are properly managed and allowed to safely vent. The City contracts with CDM Smith to conduct quarterly monitoring, inspect the methane trench (which is the stone-filled trench around the perimeter of the park) quarterly, and develop an annual environmental monitoring report that is submitted to MassDEP. When the landfill was closed, MassDEP Solid Waste Management Regulations required the owner of a closed landfill to maintain, care for, and monitor the site during the post-closure period of a minimum of 30 years. Funds will be used to develop a 30-year Post Closure Report which will require, additional testing; an assessment as to the integrity of the existing cap, stormwater features, and landfill gas controls; an update to the environmental monitoring and maintenance plan; as well as an evaluation of the condition and functionality of the existing vent trench, and analysis of the cumulative effect of siltation on the vent trench system.",

I am hereby requesting an appropriation of $310,000 from Free Cash to the Public Investment Fund Community Development Department Extraordinary Expenditures account. Funds will be used for consultant services to conduct a study that will evaluate resident experiences in affordable housing in Cambridge. The purpose of the study is to identify and assess issues faced by residents living in inclusionary affordable housing units, and to compare their experience to residents living in market-rate units in the same buildings, and to that of residents living in non-inclusionary affordable housing. The analysis will focus on identifying any biases which may exist towards tenants and homeowners living in affordable housing from landlords, property managers, owners, neighbors, or tenant or homeowner associations; how prevalent such experiences are; and whether residents in market rate units in the same buildings and non-inclusionary affordable units in other buildings have similar experiences. The process will include a survey of tenants and homeowners living in affordable and market-rate units in buildings with inclusionary housing units, as well as other affordable buildings. There will also be focus groups conducted and data walk discussions to solicit input from and review findings with residents and stakeholders. A final report is anticipated to include recommendations on ways to improve experiences in inclusionary housing. The study process is anticipated to begin within the next several weeks and be completed late next year.",

On June 8, 2020, I updated you on the City\u2019s efforts to respond to the restaurant community\u2019s need to expand outdoor dining services and I requested and received the City Council\u2019s authorization to grant street obstruction approvals, which are required for restaurants to operate outdoor dining on the sidewalk or street, from that date until November 30, 2020. I am now requesting that the City Council extend its prior authorization for me or my designee to grant such approvals, along with any other necessary approvals for temporary street obstructions, from this date until sixty (60) days past the end of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts State of Emergency. On June 1, 2020, Governor Baker issued an Order Clarifying the Progression of the Commonwealth\u2019s Phased Workplace Re-Opening Plan and Authorizing Certain Re-Opening Preparations at Phase II Workplaces (the \u201cOrder\u201d). The Order temporarily waives some of the time-consuming procedural requirements for restaurants that are licensed to sell alcoholic beverages for on-premises consumption that are applying to operate outdoor dining services and waives the requirement that the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission approve such requests. The Order also waives zoning requirements that may prohibit outdoor dining services. Any approval for outdoor dining services issued pursuant to the Order was in effect only until November 30, 2020. However, on September 10, 2020, Governor Baker issued an Order Making Certain Phase III Adjustments, which included extending any approval for restaurants that sell alcoholic beverages to operate outdoor dining services until sixty (60) days past the end of the state of emergency or such earlier date that a city or town establishes. Pursuant to Governor Baker\u2019s extension of the outdoor dining approvals, the City has likewise extended approvals for outdoor dining until sixty (60) days past the end of the state of emergency. The Board of License Commissioners voted to automatically extend all currently issued Temporary Extensions of Licensed Premises, and for outdoor dining on City streets and sidewalks, the City has extended all Sidewalk Business Use Permits for outdoor dining and is amending the term of its License Agreement for restaurants that serve alcoholic beverages with outdoor dining until sixty (60) days past the end of the state of emergency. To allow the City to continue to respond to the restaurant community\u2019s need for outdoor dining in an expeditious manner, I am hereby requesting that the City Council extend its prior authorization for me or my designee to grant street obstruction approvals, along with any other necessary approvals for temporary obstructions, from November 30, 2020 until sixty (60) days past the end of the state of emergency. I look forward to discussing this matter with you and answering any questions you may have.",

NEIGHBORHOOD & LONG TERM PLANNING, PUBLIC FACILITIES, ARTS & CELEBRATION COMMITTEE MEMBERS Councillor Patricia Nolan, Chair Councillor Dennis Carlone Vice Mayor Alanna Mallon Councillor Marc McGovern Councillor Quinton Zondervan In City Council November 16, 2020 ---|--- The Neighborhood & Long-Term Planning; Public Facilities, Arts and Celebrations Committee held a public hearing on Wednesday, October 7, 2020 at 2:00 p.m. in the Sullivan Chamber on the reappointment of Christopher Bator to the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority for a term of five years and to discuss the Envision Cambridge citywide plan, and review how to set priorities and goals. Present at the hearing were Councillor Nolan, Chair of the Committee, Naomie Stephen, Executive Assistant to the City Council, and Paula M. Crane, Deputy City Clerk. Present via Zoom were Councillor Carlone, Vice Mayor Mallon, Councillor Zondervan, Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler, Mayor Siddiqui, Lisa Peterson, Assistant City Manager, Iram Farooq, Assistant City Manager for Community Development, Chris Cotter, Housing Director, Jeff Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development, Melissa Peters, Director of Community Planning, Community Development Department (CDD), Anthony Wilson, City Clerk, Tom Evans, Executive Director, Kathleen Born, Chairperson, Board Member, Christopher Bator, Board Member, Cambridge Redevelopment Authority (CRA), Catherine Zusy, Cynthia Hibbard, Doug Brown, Elaine DeRosa, Eric Grunebaum, Heather Hoffman, Henry Vandermark, James Zall, John Hawkinson, Lee Farris, Marilee Meyer, Marlene Lundberg, Nancy Ryan, Richard Krushnic and Suzanne Blier. Councillor Nolan convened the hearing and read the Call of the Meeting and the Governor\u2019s Executive Order regarding remote participation. She asked for a Roll Call to indicate a quorum for the hearing. The roll was called and resulted as follows: PRESENT: Councillor Nolan, Councillor Carlone, and Councillor Zondervan -3 ABSENT: Vice Mayor Mallon and Councillor McGovern -2 and a quorum was present. Councillor Nolan opened the hearing to Public Comment. Lee Farris, Cambridge Residents Alliance, read from a prepared written statement (ATTACHMENT A) noting that the Envision plan goals are good overall, but some of them conflict with each other. She asked that the City discuss creating a process on how to resolve conflicting goals. Suzanne Blier stated that she attended as many meetings as she could, but she emphasized that this is not a city plan. She said that the citizens asked for one and the City hired Utile and then decided that instead of an actual plan we would settle for goals, many of which are contradictory. She said that there is no zoning code or designation of places. She said that there are key areas of the city with no plans that have been updated in many years. This has opened the City to spot zoning. She asked the City Council to look at the contradictory elements of the plan. Heather Hoffman, 213 Hurley Street, stated that she is one of the few members of the public that attend the CRA meetings. She said that the CRA could teach every other board, commission, and City Council about how to treat the public and to encourage the public to take part in their deliberations. She said that she cannot think of a member of the current CRA board that she would be happy to see replaced. She said that she would like to see Mr. Bator reappointed. She said that as it relates to Envision, it is a monumental disappointment. She said that it is not a disappointment that the people that the City hired did a lousy job, it is a disappointment because the City administration required them to do a lousy job. She said that when talking about stability, the fact is that everything the city does undermines stability. She noted that the City Council has become interested in seeing how one particular thing that the city government can do affects rent, how about rampant commercial development with no creation of long-term housing. Councillor Nolan made a motion to close Public Comment. The roll was called and resulted as follows: YEAS: Councillor Nolan, Councillor Carlone, Vice Mayor Mallon, and Councillor Zondervan -4 ABSENT: Councillor McGovern -1 and Public Comment was closed at 2:13 p.m. Councillor Nolan invited Mr. Evans to briefly provide introduction to the CRA Board process. Mr. Evans noted that the CRA has guided the city through a dynamic period. He said that Mr. Bator grew up in Cambridge and has a long career in government service. He stated that Mr. Bator has been highly attentive to the Board\u2019s fiduciary position and has worked hard to ensure that resources that they have are extended to facilitate projects throughout the City of Cambridge. He stated that Mr. Bator has encouraged thoughtful investment in purchases and other strategic partnerships. Kathy Born added that the last eight years have been a terrific exercise in small democracy in the City of Cambridge through the CRA. They have been careful in setting goals and measuring accomplishments against those goals. She said that Mr. Bator has been a most conscientious Treasurer. She said that as it relates to financial matters, Mr. Bator has been at the helm when the CRA was taken over. She said that every member of the CRA are contributing members. She said that she is happy to continue to work with Mr. Bator. Christopher Bator stated that he is happy to answer any questions that people may have. He has been deeply honored to serve on the CRA since 2012. He said he is proud of the work that has been done which involved rebuilding the CRA from Ground Zero. He asserted that the CRA has a very talented and professional staff. He said that the CRA Board works wonderfully together. He noted that he cares most about trying to move the wealth that exists in Kendall Square and spread it to important needs across Cambridge. Councillor Carlone stated that the CRA has unique capabilities and that is one of the reasons he wants them to get involved in purchase of affordable housing. He said that he is impressed with Mr. Bator. He said that the more the City Council includes the CRA in implementing projects, the better. He thanked the CRA Board for its important work. Councillor Zondervan stated that he has been impressed by the work of the CRA and the number of times that they have been rescuers in difficult situations. Councillor Zondervan asked how we can do more to develop the city in a way that is just and benefits all residents. Mr. Bator stated that he would defer to Mr. Evans for a more substantive answer. Mr. Bator said that in his view, they are deeply committed to use the resources and talents of the CRA to assist the City, not just in the core responsibilities in Kendall Square. He said that they are looking for opportunities to do work where there is need. He said that they have had a very significant grassroots strategic planning effort in order to ensure that where they choose to use the resources, it is among the most important things in the purview of the CRA. He said that the CRA seeks guidance from all important entities in the City. Mr. Evans added that the last time that the CRA met with the City Council in February, the CRA was discussing a revisit of their strategic plan. He noted that he looks forward to a broader discussion and engage the City Council in this process. Vice Mayor Mallon thanked Mr. Bator for his continued service. She said that she is appreciative of the work of the entire CRA. She said that the City Council will be drawing on the CRA in the future to get the City through the Covid situation to see all the different ways to partner together to help those in the community that are struggling. Councillor Nolan said that she is thrilled that Mr. Bator will continue his work. She said that transparency has been a hallmark of the CRA, recently, after a time of trouble and operations that were not transparent and exhibited poor practices. She expressed gratitude that the current CRA board corrected those past deficiencies and now is a great example to the rest of the city. And noted that the Foundry project is a excellent example not yet mentioned of the CRA\u2019s good work Councillor Nolan made a motion to forward a favorable recommendation to the full City Council on the reappointment of Christopher Bator to the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority for a term of five years. The roll was called and resulted as follows: YEAS: Councillor Nolan, Councillor Carlone, Vice Mayor Mallon, Councillor Zondervan -4 NAYS: -0 ABSENT: Councillor McGovern -1 and the motion passed. Councillor Nolan moved to the Envision Cambridge citywide plan. She stated that the background for the meeting is that there have been many hours spent on Envision with a robust City process that sought to develop a comprehensive planning document for the City. She said that the last meeting of the City Council on this issue was in December of 2019. She stated that today\u2019s meeting is the first step in moving forward and getting the City back on track. She said that one of hundreds of ideas was the Affordable Housing Overlay which became a central focus. She said that there are planning goals, focus areas, 300 action items with 44 priorities. She said that the publication of the final plan brought together many of the elements into the City from a range of areas. She said that we must take a step back and review where Envision landed the City, what has happened since that process. She said that the interim document was put out in 2017 with a final document in 2019\\. She said that her hope is that the committee reviews how Envision is being used and how it is shaping the work of the City. She stated that it is important for the City Council to weigh in. Ms. Farooq stated that she is appreciative of being present when the committee is voting on the reappointment of Mr. Bator. She said that the CRA is a partner agency to the City and there have been many initiatives and endeavors in which they have worked in partnership. She noted that she is pleased to see positive feedback and to see him reappointed. As it relates to the impact of Covid 19 on Envision, Ms. Farooq said that as CDD has looked at, it is a long-term plan that has not been changed significantly by Covid. She said that it does shine a stronger light on some of the elements, particularly in the last 6-7 months such as community health, social equity, and racial equity. She said that CDD has been focused over the last several months on the response to the pandemic such as supporting residents and businesses. She said it was interesting for CDD to pivot back to the long-term planning mode in preparation for this hearing. She noted that CDD did not ask partner departments to be present for the hearing but their feedback is incorporated into the materials that CDD sent out earlier this week that includes updates on each of the topic areas in terms action status. She said that in terms of the prioritization process with Envision Cambridge and each of the topic areas, it is more of a framework for how to move forward in each endeavor. In looking at all the action items and working with the community and the working groups, they went through a process of prioritization to determine higher priority items and particularly which were short term versus long term. She said that at today\u2019s meeting they are focusing on the high priority, short-term actions. Within that ,they have tried to keep maximum flexibility. She said that in terms of the work that is taken up by CDD each year is what the particular needs of the moment are. In terms of what would be most useful to staff from today\u2019s discussion, Ms. Farooq noted that being able to understand what is important to the City Council and the community is very helpful as they move toward the budgeting process. Ms. Farooq introduced Community Development staff and invited Melissa Peters to give a summary of the materials that were sent to the Committee (ATTACHMENT B). Ms. Peters gave an overview which stated that Envision Cambridge is a roadmap to the year 2030, setting out a course of action to promote inclusive and sustainable growth. She noted that the plan recommends 37 Goals, 42 strategies, and 176 new actions across six planning topics: climate and environment, community wellbeing, economy, housing, mobility and urban form. Councillor Carlone stated that he appreciates the update. He reminded everyone that he co-wrote the Policy Order and it was a struggle to get it approved. He said that it was planning and urban design yet when he looked at the urban form section, there were guidelines but there were no urban design massing studies, height studies or open space studies. He does not know how you do zoning without an urban design analysis. He said that this baffles him. Ms. Farooq addressed in the Urban Form section many of the priority areas and action items that will get to the specific urban design recommendations that Councillor Carlone is speaking of. For example, one of the recommendations is taking a closer look at the Inman Square area and what development patterns there might look like, particularly as impacted by the Green Line extension. She said that as we delve into that level of plan, that will be more granular and would incorporate more detailed urban design input that Councillor Carlone is referring to. Councillor Carlone said that all the commercial districts need to be studied. He said that it is not on the list and if you are going to do that, add it. He said that urban design will study conflicts. Councillor Carlone said that a confusing thing to him is that Envision they mandated an urban design study of Alewife. A site plan was done. He asked if that is the Alewife plan? Ms. Peters responded that when they refer to the Alewife District Plan, it is the plan that came out of the Envision process that Utile helped with. She said that if it is in reference to current zoning, the existing Concord Alewife of 2010 is still the plan on the book. She said that as they have spoken with developers in the community, they have been pushing the goals and community aspirations from the new Alewife plan into the conversation. Councillor Carlone said that is priority one given the we are getting development proposals. Councillor Carlone said that starting a study could be three meetings. He noted that he would like a schedule of when things will be done. He said that it would be great to say, \u201cThese 3 should be done in 6 months.\u201d He said that we are well past starting. He stated that starting is a good thing but literally it does not really say anything. Ms. Farooq explained that the one reason they referenced everything to starting rather than concluding is because a large percentage of the actions are ongoing actions. She said that some actions will never be complete. She said that there are things that will have a start and end such as open space planning updates. She said that a larger set of actions are ongoing items that will not be completed so that is why they linked everything to starting the work. Councillor Carlone said that there is no idea how far along the work is. He said that words are not a plan, words are not a strategy. He said it would be great to receive updates every 3-6 months, specifically on what is being currently worked on and what is being accomplished. Councillor Zondervan thanked the staff for the update and added his voice to the call for more regular updates and the addition of dashboards. He stated that the Committee heard about conflicts between different roles and one way to address the issue is do holistic planning. He said what is great about Envision Cambridge is that the first step in holistic planning has been accomplished. He said that the next step is to evaluate our actions against all the goals. He stated that a lot of actions are driven by developers who buy property and then come to the City Council. He said that if we were having a more robust discussion in the context of Envision, we would take those proposals and air them to Envision. He said that the public should not feel so left out and powerless. He said that there needs to be more effort into evaluating plans and decision going forward against these goals. He said that we do not seem to be going through any kind of guided exercise that says how to adjust the zoning to move forward in a way to accomplish goals. He said that there are constantly individual issues that ensue an argument when we should evaluate all issues against zoning and goals and then see how zoning can be more aligned with goals. He asked how we create a real planning process based on goals developed through Envision that produces a plan through zoning that lays out what we are going to do where in the city. Ms. Farooq said that as it relates to a dashboard, they are working on putting together a direct dashboard and are now in conversation with IT Department to figure out how to do the technical work and get it on CDD\u2019s website. She said that it will take several months, and the hope is to have it available sometime next year. In terms of zoning and evaluation actions, Ms. Farooq said that there are actions that are identified, and it is easy to proceed one by one through these. She said it is more challenging when it is a development or rezoning proposal. At the staff level they built in that thinking into it, but they do not specifically do holistic planning. She said that they could utilize that method. She asked Jeff Robert to add to this. She said that there are two ways to think about how to take the conceptual citywide plan and translate that into zoning and it is not a small exercise. She said that the alternative is to take every proposal before CDD (whether coming from staff, the City Council, residents or developers) and then sieve it through the sift of Envision and see what the picture looks like. She said that we must pick one path or the other. She said that she would appreciate guidance. Mr. Roberts said that in terms of overall strategy, it is important to establish planning goals and then evaluate the policies, including the Zoning Ordinance, to understand how that aligns with goals. He said that much of that work has been done in the Envision Cambridge plan. There are 30 specific actions that related to zoning. He said that one approach to tackling those is to prioritize and to work through them in some order. He said that the alternative approach is to say, \u201cPut everything else on hold so we can do a fully comprehensive reconsideration of the whole Zoning Ordinance which can have benefit, but it will take a lot of time.\u201d He said that approach of focusing efforts on things that we want accomplished the most is a good strategy but if we want to take a different tact, we could but it would come with a lot of tradeoffs. Councillor Zondervan stated that he is conflicted because he understands the challenge and yet at the same time, he thinks how can we not do both things. He said that he struggles to reconcile these two approaches. Ms. Farooq said that when thinking about capacity and that as a constraining factor, it is not just if CDD has enough staff in the zoning division, it is also if there is enough staff in other department who are analyzing each of the components. She said it is a mushroom as well as capacity at Planning Board, Ordinance Committee, etc. She said that making changes incrementally has served us quite well. Vice Mayor Mallon stated that as it relates to staff capacity, she would love to see a dashboard of the Envision goals and actions and where we are on each one of them. She said that she wonders about staff capacity to do something like that. She asked if we should entertain the idea of hiring someone outside to put together a dashboard. She said that she would like to think about how to make that come to fruition without adding burden onto CDD. As it relates to regular progress reports, she stated that she has some questions. She wondered if they could be updated. She asked if there is a way to update progress reports via color-coding with a small blurb of what is happening. Something that would indicate where we are in the absence of a dashboard would be helpful. Vice Mayor Mallon asked if there is there a way to use the committees to move work forward. She asked how the City Council committee chairs can have more of a partner with action items and move them forward in that way. Ms. Farooq said that it is a great idea. She said it is a key way to build two-way communication around specific topics and actions. She said that the committees grapple with the same kind of restraint in doing multiple things at the same time. She welcomes that partnership. Vice Mayor Mallon asked if there is a way that progress reports could be updated to show a visual representation of where the work stands. Ms. Farooq said that they will do the updates. Ms. Farooq asked Ms. Peters to provide a sense of how long this will take. She stated that we must keep in mind that more detailed updates involve more departments than CDD. She said that they will work on it and maybe take the approach of sending them forward as they are done. Ms. Peters added that they can color code the actions to correspond to the pie chart but if more detail is added they will have to reach out to staff and department heads which would take more time. She said that CDD can send color coding first and then as they go through each planning topic, they will forward to the City Council. Councillor Nolan said that we have talked about dashboards and she believed that they are in the process. Ms. Farooq said that it is in the process and she does not believe additional resources are necessary. Ms. Peters said that there is a fulltime senior planner that is charged in the Envision implementation and moving to forward. He is getting the data organized to track the indicators to ultimately go onto a dashboard. The next step is the web design and development phase. In the interim, progress reports will fill the gaps. Councillor Nolan said that the data is already partly there but it is not tied to the actual item so that has been challenging. She stated that other data would not have to be gathered. She said that we could use the sustainability platform and use for other categories. Melissa Peters stated that the intention is to use the City\u2019s web infrastructure for Envision so they have more control over updates. Councillor Nolan stated that she would like a timeline prospectively for actions to the completion or next steps of action items. Ms. Farooq responded that they aim to create the pool of priority items but retain the flexibility to be responsive to the needs of each item. She said that it is hard to ascribe timelines that go beyond the fiscal year unless it is to an item that is an ongoing item or an item that they have started. She said that for the items that have begun, they could try to layout a timeline guideline, but it will be challenging and difficult to say that for all the other items that have not begun, when they would begin. Councillor Nolan said that actions are related to strategies which are tied to a goal and the goals are long-term. She said that there are some goals that are longer term. Councillor Nolan stated that the Envision document should be all of the City Council and City staff guiding document to keep the focus on all of the goals that are encompassed. She said that as it relates to the various working groups and department heads, is there anything that the City Council should be thinking about moving forward. Ms. Farooq said that the key conversation that has been had with department heads have been around action items and ensuring that they are attaching updates. In terms of what would be most useful, Ms. Farooq said that the most useful feedback is to have clear priorities of the City Council as a body. In terms of the working groups, she said that they were informed about this discussion. Ms. Peters said that they were notified of the hearing today and some members indicated that they would be listening in. She noted that since December 2018, CDD has not regrouped with the working groups. Councillor Nolan said that this is a good start for her. She said it is a document that could be more specific. She noted that there has been some frustration about the range of actions. She said that it would make sense for the Committee to recommend to the full City Council that the work continue in the committees that are set up around these areas. Councillor Nolan made the following motion: ORDERED: That the Neighborhood and Long-Term Planning Committee, Public Facilities, Arts and Celebrations Committee recommend to the full City Council that a response to each of the six areas of the Envision plan to include holding committee meetings on each of the planning topics as they are updated and ready to be discussed, be referred to respective committees related to the goals and plans as follows: Climate and Environment to the Health and Environment Committee Community Wellbeing to the Civic Unity Committee Economy to the Economic Development and University Relations Committee Housing to the Housing Committee Mobility to the Transportation & Public Utilities Committee Urban Form to the Neighborhood and Long Term Planning, Public Facilities, Arts and Celebrations Committee Councillor Carlone stated that he agrees with the Councillor Nolan\u2019s motion. He said that this was tried before the final report came out when it was in draft form, but it was not completely successful. He said that this is the right next step. He said that CDD has both a long-term planning and instantaneous response responsibility that the City Council asks for things and the City Council expects it yesterday. He said that this department is the most unique in that way. He said that it makes sense and it might be a way to help staff understand the point of view of the City Council. Councillor Zondervan stated that the City Council can set a goal as a City Council to have a process to change City Councils to reflect the Envision goals. He said that there is a discrepancy between the current City Council goals and the Envision goals and maybe that is the place to start as a body to do this work. Councillor Nolan asked Councillor Zondervan if he was proposing adding language to the motion or would that be a separate meeting. Councillor Zondervan responded that the Committee can recommend to the full City Council to initiate a process to look at the current City Council goals and look at the Envision goals and decide on City Council goals going forward rather than perpetuating the current discrepancies. Councillor Nolan stated that the words \u201cthat it work on establishing long-term goals\u201d could be added to the motion in the first paragraph. Councillor Zondervan stated that this works but he suggested changing the word \u201cestablish\u201d to the word \u201cupdating.\u201d Vice Mayor Mallon asked the Chair to re-read the amended wording for the motion. Councillor Nolan read the following motion: ORDERED: That the Neighborhood and Long-Term Planning Committee, Public Facilities, Arts and Celebrations Committee recommend to the full City Council that it update its goals and that a response to each of the six areas of the Envision plan to include holding committee meetings on each of the planning topics as they are updated and ready to be discussed, be referred to respective committees related to the goals and plans as follows: Climate and Environment to the Health and Environment Committee Community Wellbeing to the Civic Unity Committee Economy to the Economic Development and University Relations Committee Housing to the Housing Committee Mobility to the Transportation & Public Utilities Committee Urban Form to the Neighborhood and Long Term Planning, Public Facilities, Arts and Celebrations Committee Vice Mayor Mallon suggested that a motion be made to extend the meeting by 10 minutes. Councillor Nolan made a motion to extend the hearing for 10 minutes. The roll was called and resulted as follows: YEAS: Councillor Nolan, Councillor Carlone, Vice Mayor Mallon, Councillor Zondervan -4 NAYS: -0 ABSENT: Councillor McGovern -1 and the motion passed on the affirmative vote of four members. Vice Mayor Mallon said that she is uncomfortable to speak about the City Council goals in this setting. She said that she is comfortable moving forward with the motion by Councillor Nolan. She stated that if we want to City Council goals, she believes that it should happen in a different committee and she believes that Mayor Siddiqui had spoken about a treat at some point to talk about goals. She said she is not comfortable combining those two things. She said that the Committee should focus on moving progress to the committees as originally suggested. Councillor Zondervan responded that the Committee is not suggesting to the City Council what to do other than to initiate a process to evaluate its updated goals. Councillor Carlone said that we are only talking about planning goals, not the City Council\u2019s twelve goals that will probably be refined in the next few months. He said that we are talking as it relates to Envision and it is a Policy Order that will be discussed by the full City Council. He said that this is a good discussion. Councillor Zondervan stated that the City Council should update its goals but exactly how we want to go about that is a topic for another discussion. He said that he is just saying that we should look at the goals. Councillor Nolan stated her agreement with Vice Mayor Mallon that these should be two separate motions. She stated that she would like to vote on her originally proposed motion which reads as follows: ORDERED: That the Neighborhood and Long-Term Planning Committee, Public Facilities, Arts and Celebrations Committee recommend to the full City Council that a response to each of the six areas of the Envision plan to include holding committee meetings on each of the planning topics as they are updated and ready to be discussed, be referred to respective committees related to the goals and plans as follows: Climate and Environment to the Health and Environment Committee Community Wellbeing to the Civic Unity Committee Economy to the Economic Development and University Relations Committee Housing to the Housing Committee Mobility to the Transportation & Public Utilities Committee Urban Form to the Neighborhood and Long Term Planning, Public Facilities, Arts and Celebrations Committee The roll was called and resulted as follows: YEAS: Councillor Nolan, Councillor Carlone, Vice Mayor Mallon, Councillor Zondervan -4 NAYS: -0 ABSENT: Councillor McGovern -1 and the motion passed on the affirmative vote of four members. Councillor Nolan asked Councillor Zondervan if he would like to submit another motion. Councillor Zondervan responded in the negative. Councillor Nolan thanked all those present for their attendance. Councillor Nolan made a motion for adjournment. The roll was called and resulted as follows: YEAS: Councillor Nolan, Councillor Carlone, Vice Mayor Mallon, Councillor Zondervan -4 NAYS: -0 ABSENT: Councillor McGovern -1 and the motion passed on the affirmative vote of four members.

      "full_text": "Resolution on the death of Dr. Leah Anne Zallman. WHEREAS: The City Council was deeply saddened at learning of the death of Dr. Leah Anne Zallman at the age of 40 on November 5, 2020; and ---|--- WHEREAS: Leah was born on Human Rights Day, December 10th, 1979, in Panama City, Panama; and WHEREAS: Leah was the beloved daughter of Marcia Bernbaum, and was preceded in death by her father Eric Zallman; and WHEREAS: Leah was the loving wife of Nadav Tanners; and WHEREAS: Leah attended Georgetown Day School in Washington, D.C. from which she graduated and was named a Presidential Scholar; and WHEREAS: Leah met her future husband, also a Presidential Scholar, on a bus going to the White House, and their romance began when they reconnected at Swarthmore College, which they both attended; and WHEREAS: Leah and Nadav moved to Somerville, Massachusetts and were married in 2008, and welcomed Eli (2011) and Kai (2014).

Her kindness and brilliant mind shone in every setting and interaction; and WHEREAS: Leah completed her residency at Boston Medical Center and her General Internal Medicine Fellowship at Harvard Medical School and Cambridge Health Alliance, and also received her Masters in Public Health from Harvard University; following completion of her studies she joined the faculty of Harvard Medical School and stayed on at Cambridge Health Alliance; and WHEREAS: Leah co-led Cambridge Health Alliance's programming about engaging clinicians to care for our diverse populations; she reached out to policymakers about measuring and improving access not just to health care but to food, housing, and other determinants of health for these populations; and WHEREAS: Leah published research widely in leading journals, including a pioneering study that showed that immigrants contributed more to the healthcare system than they took out of it; she was on the brink of fulfilling her dream of founding a Center for Immigrant Health Research that was to be announced later this month; and WHEREAS: Leah's passion and dedication to social justice was infused in her from infancy by her parents; she lived the ideals she was raised with fully. She once wrote, \"(my) passion arises from a deep belief that all humans have a right to health care, and that as a physician researcher, I have a role to play in elevating the voices of the most vulnerable.\" She took on that task with zest. She cared for immigrants in her clinical practice in East Cambridge, using her Spanish skills as well as her compassion and talent for listening; and WHEREAS: Leah effortlessly expressed her love to her family and friends, she drew energy from and delighted in these relationships, and the world will be a dimmer place without her; and WHEREAS: Leah\u2019s passing will leave a void in the lives of all her surviving family; her precious children Eli and Kai and her husband Nadav; her sister Shana; her mother-in-law Dina, father-in-law, Paul, sister-in-law Timna and brother-in- law Avi; her loving her nephews Jonah Smith, Zeke Smith, and nieces Isa, Talia and Elizabeth; and many other loving relatives and friends; and WHEREAS: Leah will be sorely missed by all she touched and loved; now therefore be it RESOLVED: That the City Council go on record extending its deepest sympathy for the family of Dr. Leah Anne Zallman at this time of such personal loss; and be it further RESOLVED: That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a suitably engrossed copy of this resolution to the Zallman family on behalf of the entire City Council.",

Below you will find information requested by the Ordinance Committee relative to draft alternative language to the Green Energy Analysis Zoning Petition, received from Assistant City Manager for Community Development Iram Farooq and City Solicitor Nancy E. Glowa. Overview Following the August 26, 2020 hearing on the above-referenced zoning petition, the Ordinance Committee asked CDD to suggest revised language in response to the Planning Board recommendation dated August 19, 2020 and CDD staff comments. Staff from the Division of Zoning and Development and the Division of Environmental and Transportation Planning worked together, in consultation with the Law Department, to draft alternative language that retains the intent of the petition, provides clearer guidance, and is better integrated into current zoning. As with the current petition, the suggested language would add a component to the \u201cNet Zero Narrative\u201d requiring applicants to submit an assessment of the technical feasibility and cost of installation of \u201cfossil fuel free\u201d energy systems as part of a project subject to Green Building Requirements. The Net Zero Narrative is a public document that is made available to the Planning Board and the public for advisory review when projects require special permits. The revised language is intended to describe the scope of the assessment more clearly, to ensure that developers provide clear and consistent information in a way that relates to other components of the Net Zero Narrative. Suggested Language Insert a new Paragraph 22.25.1 (c) (6) in the \u201cNet Zero Narrative\u201d submission requirements to read as follows: \u201c(6) an assessment of energy systems that do not consume fossil fuels on-site (to include solar photovoltaics and hot water, ground source, water source or air source heat pumps, district energy systems, and/or similar systems) that examines technical feasibility to meet the projected HVAC and domestic hot water demands of the building based on the information provided in 22.25.1(c)(2), and cost of installation taking into account incentives provided in 22.25.1(c)(5), all compared to code-compliant energy systems that consume fossil fuels on-site.\u201d Because such an assessment requires time to complete before a final application can be submitted, staff recommends that this additional paragraph take effect 90 days after the date of adoption. That way, development proposals that are early in the pre-application review process can begin to incorporate this requirement immediately, but proposals that are in the later stages of review will not be unreasonably affected.",

Due in large part to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and resultant decrease in parking meter revenues, the Parking Fund revenues for the Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department have suffered significantly this year. Accordingly, I am writing to request that you approve the increase of the fee for a Resident Parking Permit/Pass from $25.00 to $40.00, by amending the provisions of Chapter 10, Section 10.17.070 of the Municipal Code. The current fee of $25.00 per Resident Parking Permit/Pass was established effective with 2013 permits. The fee has historically been adjusted from time to time as costs rise, and this type of change is also in keeping with our overall transportation and sustainability goals. The $40.00 fee more accurately reflects current costs. I request that consideration be given so that if approved, the City could implement this change prior to the 2021 renewal season, which effectively starts on December 1, 2020 when the City opens the permit application portal. The proposed amendment to the applicable provisions of the Municipal Code is attached for your consideration. I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.",

      "full_text": "A communication was received from Councillor Simmons, transmitting a memorandum regarding Cambridge Brands Curb Cut. October 28, 2020 Mr. Anthony Wilson Clerk of Cambridge Cambridge City Hall Re: Memo Re Cambridge Brands Curb Cut Dear Mr. Wilson: I am submitting this letter for inclusion on the November 2, 2020 City Council meeting agenda. I exercised my Charter Right on the curb cut request by Cambridge Brands during the October 19, 2020 City Council meeting, and during the October 26 City Council meeting, I referenced an email exchange between myself, Paula Yetman from Cambridge Brands, and Charles Doty from Cambridge Brands that took place following the October 19th meeting. I am submitting that email exchange as part of this communication so that my colleagues can better understand what I was referencing last week. For further clarification: during the October 19th City Council meeting, I brought forward some legitimate concerns about the level of outreach conducted by Cambridge Brands to its neighbors, as well as the overall level of civic engagement by this company during those times when they are not seeking something from the City. The reason I exercised my charter right, and the reason I have sought additional time before we vote on this matter, is because I wished to learn more about the company\u2019s community outreach, and I have been reaching out to numerous people that live near the Cambridge Brands building. Following the October 19th Council meeting, I sent an email to Paula Yetman, the Plant Manager, as well as to Cambridge Brands attorney Charles Doty, underlining my concerns and seeking to open a dialogue with them ahead of the next Council meeting. Interestingly, Mr. Doty shared a little more with me than he intended to when he accidentally copied me on an email that was meant only for Ms. Yetman and their Cambridge Brands colleagues. In that email, he said \u201cGood job! [Councilor Simmons] has surrendered and changed the topic in order to save face. You need to respond with humility and sweetness, telling her that Cambridge Brands looks forward to working with her and continuing to participate as an active member of the Cambridge Community and the Main Street neighborhood.\u201d Within an hour of sending that email, both Ms. Yetman and Mr. Doty realized what had happened and sent me profusely apologetic emails saying that this email should not have been sent, that no disrespect was intended, and so on. And while I appreciate the apologies - the email that Mr. Doty had sent to me by accident reveals that he viewed this discussion as something of a game. And I want to make it clear: I don\u2019t view these curb cut discussions, or discussions about civic engagement and the role of a responsible corporate neighbor, as being frivolous. I do not view this as a game. Cambridge Brands has been in this community for generations, they are looking for expand, and I think that\u2019s wonderful - but I also want to know how they fit into our community, aside from simply having a physical location here. Do they feel any ties to the community? Any obligation to recruit locally for employment? Any ties to our student population? I think those are fair questions, and those are the kinds of points I\u2019ve been seeking clarity on. As I told Ms. Yetman in my initial email, I am not trying to prevent this company from expanding, but I do want to know more about how they view their relationship with the People of Cambridge. How do they plan to stay engaged with their neighborhood even after they receive this curb cut, if that comes to pass? I am still interested in having that conversation, and it\u2019s something I would hope every company operating in this city is continually thinking about. Thank you.

This is the [presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uIflcKCFbQ5wbU82xF_QnU2xevVLeVro8EuI22fWrD4/edit) provided by CPSD and some of the principals attending. We learned that while that students are greatly benefiting from in-person education, educators and leadership are struggling with time management and are feeling spread thin due to staffing challenges. It was important to hear about their successes and challenges and I look forward to working with them as we move ahead. On Wednesday, October 28th, the [Special Education and Student Supports Subcommittee](https://www.cpsd.us/UserFiles/Servers/Server_3042785/File/school_committee/notices/2020/10-28-2020_SC_SESS_subcom_notice.pdf) convened and heard from OSS leadership as well as special educators. We heard many similar themes\u2014while educators cited that students are thrilled to be back in a much-needed in-person environment, that they face insufficient time to effectively plan key efforts or to complete necessary paperwork, such as lesson planning, attendance logging, IEP documentation, evaluations, and parent engagement information. Educators continue to express that they are working extremely hard and are stretched with staff shortages. The OSS team shared that their next steps are to work with caregivers to plan for expanded hybrid in-person services and aim to get all students with IEPs back in school for the winter. This year\u2019s JK/K Lottery info sessions will be Zoom webinars and are scheduled to take place on Wednesday, November 18th 6:00-7:00 PM and Saturday November 21st 10:00-11:00 AM. Please find more information [here](https://www.cpsd.us/administration/src/registering_for/january_kindergarten_lottery). CPSD will be submitting its annual enrollment report to the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education in early November. While there may be some minor adjustments between now and then, the current data shows that there has been an overall enrollment decline of 5.6% (402 students) this school year. This enrollment decline is the first since the 2006-07 school year and ends 13 consecutive years of enrollment growth. Prior to the pandemic, enrollment had been projected to increase by approximately 2.5%. On Thursday, October 29th, my School Committee colleagues and I joined a special event with CPS scholars called \u201cMeet the School Committee\u201d, hosted by our Student Members Anais Killian and Nuriel Vera-DeGraff. It is important for our community, including our students to understand the role of the School Committee and for us to be available to answer their questions. As I mentioned last week, I have been supporting the CRLS #HerVote club\u2019s [#HerVote](https://long19.radcliffe.harvard.edu/projects/hervote/hervote- instructions/) project (in partnership with the Radcliffe Institute). If you haven\u2019t already, I encourage you all to also download and print [this template](http://schlesinger.radcliffe.harvard.edu/onlinecollections/long19th- project/files/hervote_template.pdf), to write your own response, and share it with us on Twitter and Instagram with the hashtag #HerVote in this very last stretch before the November 3rd election. We had a great turnout at our last Family Resource Fair on Saturday, October 24th on the Cambridge Public Library lawn. We are planning to hold one more Fair in November\u2014stay tuned for more information. Finally, I am excited to announce that Elevate Youth, the WorkForce Program, and my Office are extending the Local Parks Program for another 3 weeks through November 18th. Due to daylight savings, programming will run from 2:30-4:30 PM (instead of 3:30-5:30 PM) on Mondays and Wednesdays at Danehy Park. If you have or know of a 4th or 5th grader who would benefit from social and emotional learning activities centered around structured time in the outdoors, please have them submit an [application](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fforms%2Fd%2Fe%2F1FAIpQLSd_w0gDQCkuMkYsuimMbcAUwyinSwRBXT20fYHUPOeXIuOaqg%2Fviewform&data=02%7C01%7Cbkim%40cambridgema.gov%7C70b63b6227b14082193408d86571ca73%7Cc06a8be784794d73b35193bc9ba8295c%7C0%7C1%7C637370886716602683&sdata=GfaMzh3N865DYO9oEISOZXe2Uq1Q%2FPAEV9C5RfiEJgA%3D&reserved=0) ASAP.

I am hereby requesting the appropriation of $921,062 from Free Cash to the Public Investment Fund, Emergency Communications Extraordinary Expenditures account to procure a new Records Management System (RMS). The RMS is managed by the Public Safety Information Technology (PSIT) Division of the Emergency Communications Department. Funds will be used to purchase a new Police RMS to replace the current system which has been in place since 1996. The new RMS will better align with the long-term operational needs of the Police Department and will enhance reporting and investigation capabilities as well as increase accountability, compliance and transparency by capturing valuable data regarding officer\u2019s day to day activities in the community. In support of the city and Police Department\u2019s mission of improved transparency, the proposed RMS will include a Procedural Justice module that will enable the department to automate statistical analysis of motor vehicle/field stops and behavioral crisis reporting, and provide police leadership and the public an opportunity to view the data in near real-time. Eventually, the system will afford the opportunity of statistical analysis of use of force reporting as well. The new RMS will allow the Police Department to maintain core values of the department, utilize a more intuitive system to increase productivity, provide transparency on actions in the community, demonstrate impartiality in decision making, and create further opportunities for community engagement. The Police Department will also continue efforts to enhance accountability, ensure department compliance with policies and identify training opportunities on trends in the community and for those officers needing additional resources or support. This project has been reviewed pursuant to the requirements of the Surveillance Ordinance and it has been determined that the replacement RMS is covered under the existing Surveillance Technology Impact Report (STIR) that was approved for the Police Department\u2019s current RMS.",

DePasquale, City Manager, relative to Awaiting Report Item Number 20-32, regarding the feasibility of identifying one evening or day per week that the Fresh Pond Golf Course can be open to the public for general use. The City Council has requested that the City explore the feasibility of opening the Golf Course for general recreational use for one day or one evening during the week. During the golf season, the golf course is heavily used by both adults and young people for playing golf. With the restrictions for COVID-19 health and safety, there has been a significant limitation on the number of golfers each day and closing down for a day or evening would further limit play. During the golf season, allowing users besides golfers on the course would cause several problems. First, it would further reduce the time that golfer would be able to play. Second, because it is possible to access the golf course not just through the main path from the clubhouse, walkers, runners and dog walkers may be entering the golf course while play is happening putting themselves at risk because they are not certain which day or evening the course is open to them. There have been times when families or individuals have wandered onto the course because of the attraction as they walk around fresh pond. Third, the course is certified as an Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary using environmental practices that support water conservation, quality and wildlife habitat management. This requires that the golf course staff remain particularly vigilant during the playing season to maintain the course. In West Cambridge, there are other alternatives for walkers and runners because of the proximity of Danehy Park. Once the Golf Course closes for the season which will happen depending on the weather sometime in December, walkers, runners and cross country skiers are all welcome on the course. While that use can cause minor damage to the course, the staff are able to manage and maintain the course and close off limited areas only when the greens or bunkers are getting damaged.",

DePasquale, City Manager, relative to the appropriation of $5,000,000 from Free Cash to the Public Investment Fund Executive Department Extraordinary Expenditures Account for the City's third annual contribution to the MBTA Green Line Extension project. I am hereby requesting an appropriation of $5,000,000 from Free Cash to the Public Investment Fund Executive Department Extraordinary Expenditures account, for the City\u2019s third annual contribution to the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) Green Line Extension (GLX) project. This payment will bring the City\u2019s total contribution to this critical project to $15 million of the total of $25 million that we agreed to contribute, half of which will be provided through our partnership with DivcoWest relative to the Cambridge Crossing development. Two additional $5 million contributions will be due in the fall of 2021 and the fall of 2022, at which point we will have satisfied our funding commitment to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. As documented in the previous appropriation letters from January 2018 and October 2019, the GLX project has significant benefits to the City of Cambridge: \u00b7 Construction of a new Lechmere Station to replace the recently demolished facility, which was obsolete, in poor condition, and not fully accessible for those with disabilities. \u00b7 Creation of frequent and reliable service from sections of Somerville and Medford that are currently not easily accessible by public transportation. The GLX will serve trips from these locations into the key employment centers located in eastern Cambridge, as well as trips to Boston that pass through Cambridge. This will help to reduce the number of cars driving to and through Cambridge, helping us meet our transportation and environmental objectives. \u00b7 Assisting in meeting the City\u2019s and the region\u2019s mobility, sustainability, and economic development goals. According to the GLX program management team, the project is advancing on schedule and on budget and is on track to be completed within the overall project budget of $2.3 billion. The project recently passed the 50% completion milestone and service to the general public is currently slated to begin by the end of 2021. COVID-19 has exacerbated the already tight construction schedule, and the GLX team is particularly focused on determining the impacts of critical supply chain challenges and developing mitigation strategies where possible. As documented in the photos attached, the GLX project has made significant progress on construction: \u00b7 The project is well along in construction of the new Lechmere Station and the replacement of the viaduct adjacent to Cambridge Crossing/North Point. The existing viaduct-including the connection across Monsignor O\u2019Brien Highway-was demolished earlier this year and placement of steel beams for the new viaduct is largely complete, as shown in Photograph 1. As part of this work, a \u201cbus bridge\u201d is in place to move riders between Lechmere and North Station, including dedicated bus lanes on Monsignor O\u2019Brien Highway to minimize the delays for passengers using the buses. \u00b7 Construction is also well underway at the other six new Green Line stations in Somerville and Medford. \u00b7 The extension of the viaduct to connect to the two branches in Somerville and Medford is also making significant progress, as shown in Photograph 2. \u00b7 The Community Path connection from Somerville into Cambridge Crossing/North Point is being built as part of the GLX project, including the bridge that brings the Community Path across the GLX alignment near the Cambridge/Somerville border, as shown in Photograph 3. \u00b7 23 of the 24 new Type 9 Green Line trains have been delivered. These additional train sets are necessary to extend rail service along the GLX. \u00b7 Construction is progressing on the Vehicle Maintenance Building where trains will be stored and serviced, as shown in Photograph 4. Of the project\u2019s overall $2.3 billion budget, approximately $1.3 billion has been expended, and the project is employing the equivalent of 800 people across Cambridge, Somerville, and Medford. City staff continue to be heavily involved in reviewing and commenting on the design of the improvements within Cambridge, as well as the impacts on City streets and utilities. The project has hosted 32 consecutive monthly Community Working Group meetings since late 2017, which are attended by representatives from Cambridge, as well as from Somerville and Medford. In addition, staff continue to review designs and construction documents, assess utility impacts, coordinate with nearby construction projects, and assist in publicizing upcoming construction work and the resulting impacts. Based on the progress to date, the project continues to meet the requirements laid out in the Project Participation Agreement (PPA) between the City of Cambridge, the MBTA, and the Massachusetts Department of Transportation. As a result, I remain confident that the funds being contributed to the GLX project are being spent responsibly and for the purposes laid out in the PPA, and I am pleased to request this appropriation to continue our partnership with the state and the MBTA.",

      "full_text": "A communication transmitted from Louis A. DePasquale, City Manager, relative to Awaiting Report Item Number 20-49, regarding a report on the feasibility of closing several blocks of streets in Harvard Square to vehicular traffic, with the exception of deliveries. In response to Awaiting Report Item Number 20-49, regarding a report on the feasibility of closing several blocks of streets in Harvard Square to vehicular traffic, with the exception of deliveries, Traffic, Parking & Transportation Director Joseph Barr reports the following: Overall, the City is supportive of implementing street closures on weekends and possibly weeknights when they help support the vitality of local businesses and the Harvard Square neighborhood. In any such effort, we need to be sensitive to the specific needs of these groups and ensure that any changes recognize and respond to their operations. Implementation of any street closures would need to be done in a manner that increases the attractiveness of the area. This typically requires programming and activation to attract positive activity and prevent the area from looking empty or inactive. It is worth keeping in mind that activation that encourages people to congregate would have to be undertaken with caution while we are dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. Active stewardship of such spaces is important at all times, but particularly during the pandemic, to support and safely manage such activation. This is key to ensuring that changes help support the overall safety of the Harvard Square area, from the perspective of traffic safety, public health, and overall public safety. Locations where abutting restaurants or other businesses are interested in utilizing the space for outdoor dining and/or other permitted activities would be the optimal locations to be considered for closure. The Harvard Square Business Association (HSBA) is generally supportive of street closures that are limited in terms of times of the day and days of the week, and that help contribute to the vitality and liveliness of Harvard Square, particularly in areas where businesses are seeking additional outdoor space to enhance their operations. The City has successfully partnered with a number of restaurants in Harvard Square to provide additional space for outdoor dining, most prominently on Bow Street between DeWolfe Street and Plympton Street. Leaders from HSBA want to ensure that any street closures help to further activate space within Harvard Square, and do not result in the area seeming less busy or less vital. Furthermore, HSBA emphasizes that any consideration of street closures should take into account the needs and constraints of the businesses on those streets. Feedback from local business owners indicates that many small businesses are not supportive of closing the streets in and around Harvard Square beyond the current closures for outdoor dining. Construction activity in Harvard Square has resulted in reduced availability of on street parking. During the pandemic, when patrons are driving to the Square including to \u201cPick It Up Local\u201d as encouraged by the City, businesses have expressed the concern that closing additional streets and further limiting parking could negatively impact their attractiveness, which even more than usual, depend on attracting both local and regional visitors. Based on a letter sent by the Harvard Square Neighborhood Association (HSNA), they are supportive of street closures, as long as those closures are given \u201ccareful consideration\u201d and continue to take into account access to key locations that need to be accessible to motor vehicles. Their letter also acknowledges the need to accommodate deliveries to local businesses, which is a critical need. Public safety experts from the Fire Department and the Police Department have expressed concerns about the impact on emergency response that would result from the closure of major streets such as JFK Street, Mount Auburn Street, and portions of Brattle Street and/or Church Street (since those two streets provide overlapping access to certain locations within the Square). It is also important to consider that the closure of more significant streets in Harvard Square would likely result in vehicles detouring to other streets, resulting in larger volumes of through vehicular traffic on streets not designed to carry such volumes. Such diversions would also result in multiple additional movements across bikes lanes and unsignalized crosswalks, potentially leading to safety issues at those locations. Currently, such detours do take place during special events such as Octoberfest and Mayfair, but these events are accompanied by a significant police presence to manage traffic at a level that would not be sustainable for the types of daily or weekly closures proposed in this Policy Order. As with other changes that have been discussed in Harvard Square, it would be important to ensure that closure do not divert commercial traffic onto local residential streets, particularly given the limited alternative routes around Harvard Square. A number of the streets in Harvard Square carry Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) bus service, along with other bus services from the Longwood Medical Area, Harvard University, and other institutions, and we would want to ensure that any changes do not negatively impact those services. Although it would be possible to allow buses to travel through streets that are closed to general traffic, this would have to be done very carefully to ensure that all street users are safe and that unauthorized vehicles do not follow the buses through the closed area. In addition, keeping a portion of the street open for buses could compromise the overall intent and functionality of a street closure. Harvard Square is currently experiencing a significant amount of disruption due to street and building construction. As noted above, limited parking and loading zones have been a concern for businesses even prior to COVID-19. Additional closures could also further disrupt deliveries and customer parking options. These construction projects also constrain the locations where we can implement street closures that are beneficial to the local area (e.g., Linden Street is already closed due to Adams House construction). Representatives from a range of City departments meet monthly with representatives from HSBA, HSNA, and small businesses to coordinate Harvard Square construction projects and mitigation strategies to reduce their impacts on the district. Next Steps At this time when many of our local businesses are struggling with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important that we move forward deliberately and in consultation with nearby businesses, and ensure that any street closures are both beneficial to Harvard Square and take into account the public health risks associated with COVID-19. The Harvard Square Advisory Committee is charged with stewardship of Harvard Square and members include representatives of the Harvard Square Business Association, the Harvard Square Neighborhood Association, Harvard University, residents from adjoining neighborhoods, local businesses and property owners, among others. While the principal role of the advisory committee is to review development proposals in the Square, we recommend expanding their scope to incorporate consideration and consultation on potential roadway modifications as part of a pilot proposal. Staff from the Community Development Department, the Traffic, Parking, and Transportation Department, and the Department of Public Works would work with the Harvard Square Advisory Committee and solicit additional public input to evaluate a pilot intervention. For initial consideration, we recommend the following possibilities: \u00b7 Maintain the existing full and partial street closures that are currently in place in Harvard Square, specifically Winthrop Street from JFK Street to Eliot Street and the segment of Bow Street from DeWolfe Street to Plympton Street. These closures help support outdoor dining for adjacent restaurants and provide additional pedestrian space for people traveling to and through the Square. \u00b7 Palmer Street is currently an underutilized public space in Harvard Square. At the same time, it fulfils an important delivery function supporting adjacent businesses and office uses while removing those deliveries from nearby public streets. Implementation of relatively low-cost tactical visual enhancements and activation interventions could improve the quality of the public experience, emphasize the pedestrian-oriented nature of the street, and draw new activity, while still accommodating the delivery function. \u00b7 Brattle Street, between Eliot Street and Church Street, adjacent to Deguglielmo Plaza, is the location most often mentioned for a recurring closure. This space could function as a natural extension of nearby public open spaces, while supporting the business located on this segment of Brattle Street. Church Street functions as a natural alternative route to access the remainder of Brattle Street west of Church Street, so the impact on business access could be relatively limited. As noted earlier, we propose working with the Harvard Square Advisory Committee to review and develop an activation strategy for Harvard Square. If a successful approach can be developed, it could point the way towards additional street modifications in other locations around the Square. In addition to the advisory committee, we will continue to meet with the local community, including businesses, residents, and institutions to identify additional needs and potential solutions.",

      "full_text": "A communication transmitted from Louis A. DePasquale, City Manager, relative to Awaiting Report Item Number 20-51, regarding the installation on Rectangular Rapid Flash Beacons. In response to Awaiting Report 20-51, regarding an update on the installation of Rectangular Rapid Flash Beacons (RRFBs) as part of the fourth round of Participatory Budgeting and evaluate the feasibility of installing an RRFB at the intersection of Broadway and Norfolk Street, Budget Director Taha Jennings and Traffic, Parking, and Transportation Director Joseph Barr report the following: Round Four of the Participatory Budgeting program (PB4) allocated $176,000 for flashing pedestrian beacons in the FY19 Capital Budget, which allows for the installation of 22 pedestrian beacons. A typical intersection requires two beacons (one on each side of the roadway); for locations with a median (such as the northern portion of Massachusetts Avenue), three beacons are required. The PB4 proposal included a list of several potential locations for the proposed beacons. It is important to note that was simply an illustrative list of potential locations, not a definitive list of locations where a decision had been made to install an RRFB, and that the actual Participatory Budgeting ballot did not include that list. Specific locations where RRFBs are to be installed are prioritized based on crash history, roadway design/geometry, and engineering judgment. In accordance with our evidence-based approach to Vision Zero, the Traffic, Parking, and Transportation Department worked closely with the Police Department to obtain crash data for unsignalized crosswalks across the city, to allow us to prioritize the locations where the greatest improvement to pedestrian safety could be realized with the allocated funding. The safety analysis was conducted with a focus on locations with two approach lanes in a single direction. These locations, frequently referred to as \u201cmultiple threat\u201d crosswalks, have been documented in local and national research to create a higher risk of a pedestrian crash, as a driver stopping to yield to a pedestrian in the crosswalk may obstruct the visibility of the pedestrian for a driver approaching in the second lane. Rectangular Rapid Flashing Beacons (RRFBs) are a proven countermeasure that have been documented to significantly improve driver yielding at multi-lane crosswalks. Table 1 below documents each of the locations that was selected based on analyzing crash data and assessing pedestrian safety. These locations will fully utilize the funding allocated in PB4. City staff are currently engaged in a further review of the remaining crosswalks citywide in order to identify locations for additional crosswalks which have been funded for $150,000 under PB6, which will allow for the installation of approximately 20 more beacons. Through that process staff will be reviewing locations near schools, parks, and senior centers, as well as the locations noted in the Policy Order on Broadway and Hampshire Street. Staff will work with the Purchasing Agent over the winter to conduct a bidding process, with construction on the next round of beacons commencing in the Spring.

In response to Awaiting Report Item Number 20-25, which requested that the City work with the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) to identify the bus stop at the corner of Massachusetts Avenue at Churchill Avenue as serving Matignon High School, Traffic, Parking & Transportation Director Joseph Barr reports the following: Based on discussions with MBTA staff, they are open to changing the name of the stop to recognize the proximity to Matignon High School and would recommending making the change at both the inbound stop at Cottage Park Avenue and the outbound stop at Churchill Avenue. This name change would be communicated to customers through both audio and visual announcements on board the bus. To provide a customer service experience that is consistent with how these types of landmarks are identified elsewhere in the system, the MBTA would continue to refer to these stops as Massachusetts Ave at Cottage Park Ave or Massachusetts Ave at Churchill Ave, but would add Matignon High or Matignon HS after the intersection location, in line with this request. For example, the official name of the bus stop would become \u201cMassachusetts Ave @ Churchill Ave - Matignon High\u201d or \u201cMassachusetts Ave @ Churchill Ave - Matignon HS\u201d (the exact name will be constrained by character limits within the electronic systems that audibly and visually announce upcoming stops). The MBTA has indicated that they should be able to make this change by the end of the year, as part of their regular updates to the stop names in the electronic systems on board their buses.",

(12) Environmental Comfort Plan - providing professional assessments of the impacts of the development on neighboring properties and the general public in terms of excessive noise, lighting, wind, and shadows, and describing measures taken to mitigate such impacts through building location and massing, arrangement of uses, screening, and other building and site improvements; and (13) Architectural Character Plan - describing general approaches to the design of buildings, landscaped areas, streets, and pathways, identifying the type of visual character that the development will aim to achieve, with the expectation that specific designs of individual buildings and spaces will be reviewed in further detail as they are developed. 20.930.3 Master Plan Approval. The Planning Board may grant a Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Special Permit, incorporating any approved special permits for the Development Parcel, subject to the following provisions: (a) Criteria. In addition to the general special permit criteria set forth in Section 10.43, the Project Review Special Permit criteria set forth in Section 19.25, and all other criteria applicable to the special permits being sought, the Planning Board shall find that the following criteria are met when granting a Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Special Permit: (1) The Master Plan is in substantial conformance with the vision, goals, and recommendations set forth in the Alewife District Plan, including any amendments to the Alewife District Plan or future City planning reports that address the Alewife District, including but not limited to the topics of land use, open space, urban form, mobility, climate and environment, housing, economy, and zoning, and with any urban design guidelines published by the City pursuant to the Alewife District Plan or any amendments thereto or future planning reports that address the Alewife District; (2) The Master Plan is in substantial conformance with applicable standards for flood and heat resilience recommended through the City\u2019s Climate Change Preparedness and Resilience planning efforts or future climate change planning efforts; and (3) The Master Plan will result in the completion of a publicly accessible connection for bicyclists and pedestrians, at a minimum, across the railroad right of way between the Triangle District and the Quadrangle Northwest District, with conditions incorporated into the project phasing that will ensure its completion. A connection that accommodates passenger shuttles is desirable. (4) Housing - The revised zoning requires that a development proposal must be in general conformance with the Alewife District Plan, which would include land use. The Alewife District Plan calls for residential use west of the extension of Spinelli Place, which is about 40-50% of the anticipated development area. If desired, the Council could add provisions in the \u201cCriteria for Approval\u201d section such as a minimum amount or percentage of residential use, and/or requirements for phasing. An approach used in past mixed-use developments has been to require the residential phase to commence before 60% of permitted commercial uses are built, and to complete the residential phase before or concurrently with the completion of commercial uses. Within these constraints, a timing and phasing plan for the development would be subject to review and approval by the Planning Board. (5) Parking - This is also part of the required conformance with the Alewife District Plan as included in the revised text. As in other areas of redevelopment, the Alewife District Plan anticipates that parking would be used flexibly to serve uses throughout the area at different times while minimizing the number of parking spaces provided. Minimum parking ratios by use would be eliminated except for a smaller minimum for housing to mitigate possible impacts on public street parking, and maximum parking ratios by use would be established as follows: a. Retail: maximum 1.5 per 1,000 SF b. Office: maximum 1.1 per 1,000 SF c. R&D: maximum 0.8 per 1,000 SF d. Industrial: maximum 0.5 per 1,000 SF e. Residential: maximum 0.75 per dwelling unit, minimum .25 per dwelling unit (b) Conditions. The Quadrangle Northwest District Master Plan Special Permit shall set forth conditions to ensure that the applicable criteria are met, including but not limited to the following conditions: (1) Approved land uses and dimensional characteristics of the Master Plan at an aggregate level and for individual building sites; (2) Required public improvements and other benefits such as infrastructure and open space; (3) Required measures to mitigate development impacts, including but not limited to transportation impacts and construction activity; (4) Procedures for review and approval of the designs of individual buildings, open spaces, public improvements, and other components of the Master Plan; and (5) Timing and phasing for completion of the different components of the Master Plan, including but not limited to required public improvements, benefits, and mitigation. (c) Commencement. The commencement of construction of any single building approved in a Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Special Permit shall constitute exercise of the special permit for purposes of M.G.L. Chapter 40A and Section 10.46 of this Zoning Ordinance. The timing of completion shall be set forth by the Planning Board in the conditions of the special permit, which timing may be extended by the Planning Board upon a showing of good cause, and shall be subject to other conditions related to timing and phasing set forth in the special permit conditions. (d) Amendments. A Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Special Permit may identify specific modifications to the Master Plan that may be subject to future approval by a written determination of the Planning Board. Otherwise, the Planning Board shall determine whether a proposed modification is a Major Amendment or Minor Amendment according to the standards set forth in Sections 12.37.1 through 12.37.3 of this Zoning Ordinance. 20.930.4 Modifications to Standards. Except as otherwise set forth herein, any project receiving a Quadrangle Northwest District Master Plan Special Permit shall comply with all other applicable development standards set forth in this Zoning Ordinance. The following modifications may be authorized by the Planning Board upon granting a Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Special Permit: (1) The Additional FAR provisions of Paragraph (1) of Section 20.95.11 of this Zoning Ordinance may be applied to a Quadrangle Northwest Development Parcel in its entirety if the proposed development incorporates construction of a publicly accessible pedestrian and bicycle bridge connection across the railroad right of way between the Quadrangle Northwest District and the Triangle District or incorporation of structural elements into a building's design that includes or would permit future construction of such a pedestrian connection (that are acceptable to the City for that purpose), as well as the conveyance (in a form acceptable to the City) of the necessary fee or easement property interests in land that would permit access to such a connection, in a manner and to an extent determined to be sufficient to significantly advance the objectives of the Alewife District Plan . (2) The height of any building, regardless of use, may be increased to a maximum of eighty-five (85) feet, but shall remain subject to the limitations of Section 20.95.2, Paragraph 1(a) within 100 feet or 200 feet of a residential or Open Space district, provided the Planning Board finds that the entire leasable ground story of any non-residential building (excluding entrances/exits, lobbies, circulation, utilities, loading, and other functions necessary to serve upper-story uses or the building as a whole) is planned, designed, and constructed for the occupancy of light industrial uses and/or businesses that require light industrial space but also include a consumer- facing or community-focused component as described in the Economy Recommendations of the Alewife District Plan, with floor-to-ceiling heights that the Board finds to be suitable for such uses. The Planning Board may approve a limited number of Retail and Consumer Service Establishments to provide neighborhood amenities if they do not collectively occupy more than twenty percent (20%) of any building\u2019s total Ground Story and the Board finds that they do not detract from the emphasis on light industrial spaces as described in the Alewife District Plan. A residential building, which may include above-grade structured parking that is located to the rear of and visually screened from the street by principal-use residential space, may also be increased to a maximum of eight-five (85) feet without being required to meet the other requirements of this Paragraph. (3) If the Planning Board finds that the ground story of any building requires elevation above the existing mean grade in order to conform to flood resilience standards as established by the City, then the maximum height of any building may be further increased by not more than four (4) feet or the difference between the ground story finished floor elevation and the existing mean grade, whichever is lesser. To make such finding, the Planning Board shall have received and reviewed a written report from the City Engineer describing flood resilience standards applicable and the impact of those standards to the development site. (4) Spaces within the ground story of any non-residential building that are reserved for light industrial uses or businesses that require light industrial space but also include a consumer-facing or community-focused component as described in the Economy Recommendations of the Alewife District Plan may be excluded from the calculation of Gross Floor Area for the purpose of applying the limitations and requirements of this Zoning Ordinance, provided that the dimensions of such spaces, their permitted range of approved uses, and other conditions to ensure that the intent of the Alewife District Plan is met shall be set forth in writing by the Planning Board in the Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Special Permit. (5) Applicable minimum parking requirements shall be waived, and the Planning Board shall set forth maximum limitations and other conditions pertaining to the development and operation of off-street parking facilities in accordance with the Mobility Recommendations of the Alewife District Plan. (6) Applicable yard requirements and limitations, with the exception of requirements for yards abutting a residential or Open Space district as set forth in Paragraph (2) of Section 20.95.31 of this Zoning Ordinance, shall be modified to the extent necessary to conform to the recommended building setbacks and street sections recommended in the Urban Form and Mobility Recommendations of the Alewife District Plan, as approved by the Planning Board.",

DePasquale, City Manager, relative to Awaiting Report Item Number 20-47, regarding a report on heat lamps and outdoor dining during the COVID-19 public health crisis. In response to Awaiting Report Item Number 20-47, regarding a report on heat lamps and outdoor dining during the COVID-19 public health crisis, DPW Commissioner Owen O\u2019Riordan, Fire Chief Gerard Mahoney, Chief Public Health Officer Claude Jacob, and Assistant to the City Manager Matthew Nelson report the following: Since early June when the City began accepting Temporary Outdoor Seating applications, the City has processed 103 permits for extended outdoor seating., These are in addition to the patios that were approved with no additional expansion. In anticipation of the need to extend outdoor dining into colder months, the Fire Department expanded its heat lamp Pilot Patio Heater Pilot Project from Harvard Square to citywide. To date the Fire Department has permitted thirty- eight heat lamp permits throughout Cambridge. This is up from just two restaurants having permits for heat lamps when this program was piloted in Harvard Square in 2018. The Fire Department has set up a simple online permitting portal to make the process as efficient as possible. Since outdoor dining was allowed to operate as part of Phase II of the State\u2019s reopening plan in June, Cambridge Restaurants have been following the State\u2019s Safety Standards for Restaurants The exception in Cambridge is that restaurants are only permitted to allow six patrons to be seated per table, and that as the guidelines state: Tables must be positioned so to maintain at least a 6 foot distance from all other tables and any high foot traffic areas (e.g., routes to bathrooms, entrances, exits); tables may be positioned closer if separated by protective / non-porous barriers (e.g., structural walls or plexiglass dividers) not less than 6 feet high installed between tables and high foot traffic areas. The City, working with the Central Square BID and the other business associations, has coordinated with the BID for the BID\u2019s procurement, storage and distribution of propane heaters to those businesses who have expressed an interest in purchasing propane heaters, so as to allow them to continue outdoor dining through the fall into the winter months. It is expected that these heaters will be available to be picked up from an MIT storage facility during the next week. The City continues to explore options on ways to make it easier for restaurants to operate in the colder months, including but not limited to: providing notification to restaurants in advance of winter storms, and helping to facilitate access to outdoor heaters and propane.",

(a) The intent of this non-binding review process is to advance the City\u2019s desired outcomes for the form and character of AHO Projects. To promote the City\u2019s goal of creating more affordable housing units, AHO Projects are permitted to have a greater height, scale, and density than other developments permitted by the zoning for a given district. This procedure is intended to promote design outcomes that are compatible with the existing neighborhood context or with the City\u2019s future planning objectives for the area. (b) The City\u2019s \u201cDesign Guidelines for Affordable Housing Overlay,\u201d along with other design objectives and guidelines established for the part of the city in which the AHO Project is located, are intended to inform the design of AHO Projects and to guide the Planning Board\u2019s consultation and report as set forth below. It is intended that designers of AHO Projects, City staff, the Planning Board, and the general public will be open to creative variations from any detailed provisions set forth in such objectives and guidelines as long as the core values expressed are being served. (c) At least two community meetings shall be scheduled at a time and location that is convenient to residents in proximity to the project site. The Community Development Department (CDD) shall be notified of the time and location of such meetings, and shall give notification to abutters, owners of land directly opposite on any public or private street or way, and abutters to the abutters within three hundred feet of the property line of the lot on which the AHO Project is proposed and to any individual or organization who each year files with CDD a written request for such notification, or to any other individual or organization CDD may wish to notify. (i) The purpose of the first community meeting shall be for the developer to share the site and street context analysis with neighborhood residents and other interested parties prior to building design, and receive feedback from community members. (ii) The purpose of the subsequent community meeting(s) shall be to present preliminary project designs, answer questions from neighboring residents and other interested members of the public, and receive feedback on the design. The date(s), time(s), location(s), attendance, materials presented, and comments received at such meeting(s) shall be documented and provided to CDD. (d) Following one or more such community meeting(s), the developer shall prepare the following materials for review by the Planning Board. CDD shall review to certify that the submitted written and graphic materials provide the required information in sufficient detail. All drawings shall be drawn to scale, shall include a graphic scale and north arrow for orientation, and shall provide labeled distances and dimensions for significant building and site features. (i) A context map indicating the location of the project and surrounding land uses, including transportation facilities.

Wade, which recognized the fundamental principle that women\u2019s bodies are their own and guaranteed all people the right to safe and legal abortion; and ---|--- WHEREAS: An individual\u2019s freedom to make reproductive decisions is vital to their safety, well-being, economic opportunity, and ability to participate equally in society; and WHEREAS: The constitutional right to abortion does not translate into equitable access to care as barriers to access are entrenched in discrimination, stigma, and political interference to keep safe, legal abortion out of reach and unaffordable for many people; and WHEREAS: Nearly 1 in 4 women will have an abortion, but when denied abortion due to these barriers, women and their families suffer from well-being and economic opportunity, where studies have shown that a person denied access to abortion is more likely to fall into poverty than a person who can receive abortion; and WHEREAS: Since 2011, politicians have passed over 400 new laws in 33 states to shame, pressure, and punish people seeking abortion; and WHEREAS: These attacks have been bolstered by the current administration\u2019s assault on health care access and reproductive rights; and WHEREAS: Even in Massachusetts, access to safe, legal abortion is still dictated by a person\u2019s income, insurance status, and whether a young person\u2019s household supports their right to make their own, private medical decisions; and WHEREAS: With a U.S. Supreme Court ripely poised to further erode or eliminate Roe v. Wade, Massachusetts must strengthen its commitment to reproductive rights and modernize its laws so every person has access to safe, legal abortion and can decide for themselves if and when to become a parent; and WHEREAS: Senator Harriette L. Chandler and Representatives Patricia A. Haddad and Jay D. Livingstone have introduced the Roe Act (S. 1209, H. 3320) to address these inequalities and ensure safe abortion access in Massachusetts; and WHEREAS: The Roe Act will improve access to affordable abortion by removing unnecessary, burdensome provisions that delay and deny care by: \u00b7 Eliminating the burdensome judicial bypass process teenagers must navigate to access safe, legal abortion, aligning young people\u2019s ability to access abortion with their ability to access all other pregnancy-related care; \u00b7 Bolstering access to safety-net coverage for abortion regardless of a resident\u2019s income or legal status, which already exists for all other pregnancy-related care; \u00b7 Expanding access to abortion after 24 weeks of pregnancy in cases of fatal fetal anomalies; \u00b7 Eliminating unwarranted government intrusions and criminal penalties; \u00b7 Ending intrusive reporting requirements that jeopardize physician safety and patient privacy; and \u00b7 Reforming state laws and language to codify principles of reproductive freedom; now therefore be it RESOLVED: That the City Council go on record supporting the Roe Act and restate its commitment to the protection of abortion rights, reproductive health care rights, and individuals\u2019 rights to make reproductive decisions about their own bodies; and be it further; RESOLVED: That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward suitably engrossed copies of this Resolution to U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, U.S. Senator Edward J.

We were joined by Glenn Koocher, Executive Director of the Massachusetts Association of School Committees, who facilitated conversations around School Committee norms and how to improve our communication with one another and the Superintendent. The goal of this retreat was to create a space for the School Committee to have honest and in-depth discussions to build rapport. As I mentioned in my last communication, my Office has partnered with the Work Force Program to bring Elevate Youth to Cambridge <https://cambridge.wickedlocal.com/news/20200925/strongcambridge-partners- with-elevate-youth-to-launch-parks-programstrong> for free and safe in-person outdoor programming for CPS students in grades 4 and 5 twice a week on Mondays and Wednesdays from September 23rd to October 28th at Danehy Park in North Cambridge and Sennott Park in the Port. Our participating youth will be led by older youth instructors, through the Work Force Program. We are continuing to target 4th and 5th grade students who live close to these parks (or can secure transportation) and would not typically have the chance to experience the outdoors with a structured and supervised program. If you know anyone with children in our target population, please share this application <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd_w0gDQCkuMkYsuimMbcAUwyinSwRBXT20fYHUPOeXIuOaqg/viewform> with them ASAP. My Office will be hosting a couple more Family Resource Fairs in partnership with CPS and the School Committee this month. Our upcoming Fairs are on Saturday, October 3rd, outside the Putnam Avenue Upper School from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and on Saturday, October 17th, on the Cambridge Public Library lawn from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM. Both will be quick grab-and-go events for answering back-to-school questions and sharing resources. The School Committee\u2019s next Regular Meeting <https://www.cpsd.us/UserFiles/Servers/Server_3042785/File/school_committee/notices/2020/10-6-2020_SC_Meeting_Notice.pdf> will be at 6:00 PM on Tuesday, October 6th, 2020. Please see the agenda here <https://www.cpsd.us/cms/One.aspx?portalId=3042869&pageId=69707989>. I want to highlight the latest draft of CPSD\u2019s COVID-19 Safety & Facilities Manual <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XtUFRjKa9O9qZ9n-JphustSTvr73N41xllfDkEvHy0k/edit>, which we will be discussing on Tuesday night.

The reimbursement occurs in the fiscal year following the year the expense was incurred. In FY20, approximately $25,000 -$50,000 was expended for this purpose. The percentage of expenses that will be reimbursed by the state will likely change from year to year and is unknown at this time.

      "full_text": "A Zoning Petition Has been received from Cambridge Redevelopment Authority regarding a Zoning Ordinance to reflect the proposed changes to the KSURP. Petition Language: To amend Article 14 of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT: KENDALL CENTER Introduction: When Eversource announced its plans for a new electrical substation on Fulkerson Street, the City Manager asked City and CRA staff, as well as representatives from the local development community, to explore an alternative site for the facility. After the numerous hearings held by City Council regarding the substation proposal, Boston Properties (BXP) approached the City and CRA about the idea of placing the substation on the site of the existing \u201cBlue Garage\u201d within the MXD District of the Kendall Square Urban Renewal Project Area. Although this alternate site is highly preferred to the Fulkerson Street location, there are nonetheless many complex technical challenges associated with relocating the substation to this parcel. It involves not only the design of the substation and high voltage access routes to the location, but also completing plans for the housing program currently outlined in the Infill Development Concept Plan, fulfilling interim and future parking requirements, and designing locations for additional development to provide financial support for this alternative location. The CRA hereby submits this zoning petition to amend the Article 14 of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance: MXD Development District: Kendall Center in order to accommodate the relocation of the Eversource substation to the BXP site. Corresponding changes will also be required to the Kendall Square Urban Renewal Plan. These changes would affirm the regional utility infrastructure land use in the district, as well as provide for additional development rights and make adjustments to some dimensional restrictions to facilitate the alternative site. 1. Replace the current Subsection 14.21.7(6) with the following text: 14.21.7(6) Transformer station, substation, gas regulator station, or pumping station and related utility uses. 2. Replace first three paragraphs of current Subsection 14.32.1 with the text below: 14.32.1 The Aggregate gross floor area (GFA) of development in the District shall not exceed the sum of (i) four million, four hundred seventy three thousand (4,473,000) square feet, plus (ii) six hundred thousand (600,000) square feet that shall be limited to multi-family residential uses as permitted in Section 14.21.4(1), for a total Aggregate GFA not to exceed five million, seventy three thousand (5,073,000) square feet. Up to sixty thousand (60,000) square feet of such Aggregate GFA of four million, four hundred seventy-three thousand (4,473,000) in clause (i) of the preceding sentence, shall be allowable only by special permit pursuant to Section 14.72. At least two hundred thousand (200,000) square feet of the GFA restricted to housing uses shall occur only within the area designated on the Zoning Map as the \u201cAmes Street District\u201d and has been approved by special permit dated March 27,2015 (the \u201cAmes Street Residential Project\u201d). Additionally, a building permit for construction of a residential project of at least four hundred thousand (400,000) square feet shall be issued prior to or concurrently with the issuance of a building permit for any project utilizing Utility Project GFA (as defined in Section 14.32.2 below). The design review process for a residential project of at least four hundred thousand (400,000) square feet shall also precede, or proceed concurrently with, the design review process for any project utilizing Utility Project GFA, in accordance with a special permit approving a Concept Plan as set forth in Section 14.32.2 below. 3\\. Add the following paragraph to the end of Subsection 14.32.2: Any additional Infill GFA for commercial uses that is not the subject of the existing Concept Plan approved by Special Permit PB #315 on March 20, 2017 (as amended by Amendment #1 (Major) dated January 31, 2019) (collectively, the \u201cExisting Concept Plan\u201d) may only be utilized in conjunction with the development by NSTAR Electric Company d/b/a Eversource (or its successors and assigns) of a substation within the District (\u201cthe Substation Project\u201d) and only on property within the District owned by the entity (or an affiliate thereof) that provided the land on which the Substation Project is to be developed. For the purposes of this Article, the eight hundred thousand (800,000) square feet of Infill GFA for commercial uses that is not the subject of the Existing Concept Plan may sometimes be referred to as \u201cUtility Project GFA\u201d. The issuance of a building permit for the Substation Project shall precede or be issued concurrently with the issuance of a building permit for any project utilizing Utility Project GFA. The MXD District is expected to achieve high standards for urban design, architectural design, environmental sustainability and open space design, and to transform the area into a recognizable center of activity and civic life for Kendall Square and the surrounding neighborhoods. The District should create open space to serve residents in the area, as well as workers, students from nearby institutions, and visitors. It should promote permeability at the edges of the District, and create public spaces that will feel welcoming and comfortable for all users. 4. Replace current Subsection 14.32.2.1(8) and 14.32.2.1(9) with the following text: 14.32.2.1 Infill Development Concept Plan Requirements: 8) A plan describing street, public infrastructure, and utility improvements to be undertaken in coordination with the development program, including all proposed water, stormwater and sewage facilities, and (in conjunction with the Substation Project) the general location of the proposed substation, which shall also be submitted to the Department of Public Works for review. 9) A plan illustrating proposed building scale, height and massing, including a model and a study demonstrating the anticipated shadow and wind impacts of all proposed buildings taller than 100 feet, and a general description of proposed mitigation measures that will be employed. Additionally the plan will include a narrative describing the plan\u2019s compatibility, coordination and consistency with the urban design guidelines set forth in the Kendall Square Final Report of the K2C2 Planning Study (\u201cK2 Guidelines\u201d) the Volpe Working Group\u2019s Planning & Design Principles dated July 20, 2017 (the \u201cVolpe Guidelines\u201d) and the planning principles referenced in Section 14.32.2. 5. Replace current Subsection 14.32.2.2 with the following text: 14.32.2.2 Findings and Approval. The Planning Board shall grant a special permit approving a Concept Plan upon finding that the new development identified within the plan meets the criteria for approval of a Planned Unit Development set forth in Section 12.35.3(3) of the Zoning Ordinance and the criteria for approval of a Project Review Special Permit set forth in Section 19.25 of the Zoning Ordinance. In making its findings, the Board shall consider the objectives set forth in the K2 Guidelines and the Volpe Guidelines. The approval of a Concept Plan shall serve to meet any applicable project review requirements of Article 19.000, and no additional Project Review Special Permit shall be required for new development that is identified within an approved Concept Plan. In addition, while the location of the Substation Project is to be shown on a Concept Plan, the actual development of the Substation Project shall not be included within the scope of a special permit approving a Concept Plan (but shall remain subject to all applicable regulations governing the construction of such projects). 6. Add the following new Subsection 14.32.5(d) at the end of Subsection 14.32.5: d) Inapplicability to Utility Project GFA. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 14.32.5. there shall be no Innovation Space requirement for any project utilizing Utility Project GFA (nor shall any such project utilizing Utility Project GFA be entitled to utilize Innovation Space in order to obtain a GFA Exemption under Section 14.32.6(3) below). 7\\. Replace current Subsection 14.32.6(2) and 14.32.6(3) with the following text: 2) Outdoor Area Exemptions: Private outdoor decks or balconies for multi- family residential or commercial development, up to eight percent (8%) of the building floor area. 3) Innovation Space: Innovation Space GFA up to the lesser of either twenty percent (20%) of the Infill GFA dedicated to Office and Biotechnology Manufacturing Uses or one hundred five thousand (105,000) square feet. In order for the Innovation Space GFA to be exempt from the Aggregate GFA limitations, at least twenty five percent (25%) of the Innovation Space utilization (measured by square footage or shared space membership) must be set aside as below market rate space to be offered by the CRA or the City to qualifying tenants for short-term leases consistent with Section 14.32.5(b). 8. Add the following new Subsections 14.32.6(7) and 14.32.6(8) at the end of Subsection 14.32.6: 7) Electrical Substation: The Substation Project shall be exempt from Aggregate GFA calculation as well as the requirements as to Floor Area Ratio. Further, substation construction shall not constitute Infill GFA (or Utility Project GFA). 8) Educational Lab, Classroom or Training Facility: Up to twenty thousand (20,000) square feet of educational, health or workforce training facilities operated to provide services to the general public (as opposed to private facilities that are solely accessible by tenants or occupants of commercial buildings within the District), which such services are either permitted as of right within the District in accordance with the provisions of this Article 14 or may otherwise be permitted by special permit. 9. Add the following new paragraph at the end of Section 14.33: Notwithstanding the provisions of the immediately preceding paragraph, there shall be no maximum floor area ratio for any project utilizing Infill GFA (including Utility Project GFA). However, the District Development Limitations in Section 14.32 shall continue to apply. 10. Replace first paragraph of Section 14.34 with the following text: 14.34 Building Height Limitation. The maximum building height in the District shall be two hundred and fifty (250) feet. Notwithstanding the foregoing, one building within the District may reach four hundred (400) feet provided, however, that the occupied floors above two hundred and fifty feet (250) feet may only contain residential and associated amenity space. Additionally, the floorplate of any portion of a building above two hundred fifty (250) feet shall not exceed twelve thousand five hundred (12,500) square feet. 11. Replace current Section 14.38 with the following text: 14.38 Active Ground Floors. The ground floor of newly constructed buildings utilizing fifty thousand (50,000) square feet or more of Infill GFA, where that ground floor fronts onto Main Street, Broadway or Ames Street, must be occupied by (i) Retail and Consumer Service uses, as listed in Section 14.21.3, or (ii) active public gathering space (whether enclosed or open), along a minimum length of seventy-five percent (75%) of the building fa\u00e7ade along this frontage; provided, however, that the requirement shall be forty percent (40%) for any building with a fa\u00e7ade length of one hundred (100) feet or less along such frontage onto Main Street, Broadway or Ames Street. Dimensional variations and alternate uses may be approved by the Planning Board upon determining that the specific uses and designs proposed are consistent with the purpose and intent of this Section 14.38. Alternatively, if a Concept Plan provides for the redevelopment of existing buildings to include new Retail and Consumer Service uses along the ground floor of any of the identified street frontages, then the Planning Board may permit a reduction in the required length of active street frontage for new buildings for up to fifty percent (50%) of the length of new active street frontage provided in existing buildings and only if the Board finds that it results in a better outcome for the District as a whole. Banks and financial institutions shall not be considered active ground floor uses for the purposes of meeting this requirement. 12. Replace current Section 14.39 with the following text: 14.39 Letter of Commitment. It is acknowledged and agreed that the Letter of Commitment dated December 21, 2015 by Boston Properties Limited Partnership is hereby replaced by the Letter of Commitment dated January 28, 2021 by the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority. As such, the Letter of Commitment dated December 21, 2015 by Boston Properties is declared null and void and of no further force or effect, and shall no longer be binding upon Boston Properties Limited Partnership or its successors and assigns. 13. Replace the first paragraph of Subsection 14.52.2 with the following text: 14.52.2 With the exception of multi-family residential development, there are no minimum parking requirements for new development in the District. Residential development shall provide at a minimum 0.25 automobile parking spaces per dwelling unit. All proposed development shall be restricted from constructing parking spaces, either on or off the lot within the District, beyond the maximum allowances of Table 1. If a development includes more than one category of use, then the number of spaces allowed for the development shall be the sum of the allowance for each category of use. Where the computation of required spaces results in a fractional number, only a fraction of one half or more shall be counted as one. The Planning Board may approve arrangements for shared parking of such residential parking spaces with commercial spaces or otherwise adjust the minimum parking requirements based on review and analysis of anticipated parking demand within the Transportation Impact Study. 14. Replace current Subsection 14.52.3 with the following text: 14.52.3 The parking allowances specified in Table 1 may be satisfied by a lease agreement between the developer and the City, other public entity, or private consortium for use of parking spaces in a public or pooled private parking facility located within the District (or, in the case of the spaces required for residential uses, located outside of the District but within one thousand (1,000) feet of the residential building for which the parking is being provided, measured from property edge to property edge), provided that on a temporary basis, spaces required for residential uses may be within two thousand (2,000) feet of the residential building while permanent residential parking is being constructed. The total number of parking spaces leased and constructed within the district for development on a lot shall not exceed the maximum allowances provided for in Table 2. 15. Replace current Subsection 14.52.6 with the following text: 14.52.6 Bicycle Parking: Bike parking shall be provided as set forth in Section 6.100 of this Zoning Ordinance; provided that in issuing a special permit approving a Concept Plan, the Planning Board may determine that the bicycle parking requirements for individual buildings shown on the Concept Plan may be met utilizing a campus planning approach toward bicycle parking. 14.52.6.1 Intent: To allow flexibility within the high-density environment of the MXD District while providing high quality, equitable, and thoughtfully planned bicycle parking and sustainable transportation amenities for all users, consistent with Section 6.108.2. Given the complexity of infrastructure requirements of the Substation Project, the bicycle parking provisions set forth in Section 6.100 is infeasible, and a comprehensive bicycle parking plan will be needed to help to balance space constraints and competing uses on or near the ground level. 14.52.6.2 Bike Parking Plan: The bicycle parking plan may utilize a combination of the following strategies, or other design provisions that meet the principles of Section 6.108.3: a) Public Bicycle Sharing Facilities: Where a new, standard-size Public Bicycle Sharing Station or larger is provided (i) on the lot, or (ii) on a site within five hundred (500) feet of the lot, with written approval of the City if located on a public street or other City Property, or otherwise by legally enforceable mutual agreement with the owner of the land on which the station is to be located. If Public Bicycle Sharing Station(s) are provided, each bicycle dock within that station may count for up to two (2) required bicycle parking spaces. Should it be deemed beneficial to the operation of a Public Bicycle Sharing system by the Community Development Department and the Public Bicycle Sharing system operator, a developer may meet additional bicycle parking requirements by providing a secure, accessible and geographically central location for the storage and/or maintenance of the publicly shared bicycles. If a Public Bicycle Sharing storage and/or maintenance facility is provided, each designated bicycle storage space shall count for up to one-half (0.5) of a required bicycle parking space b) Countercyclical Bicycle Parking Facility: As the District will contain residential and commercial uses having different peak parking demand times, multiple buildings may share parking facilities within three hundred (300) feet from each other. A shared bicycle parking space may count as a required bicycle parking space for both a residential use and a commercial use within separate buildings within a campus plan. c) Complementary Valet Bicycle Parking: Bicycle parking may be provided through a valet bicycle parking program that is offered free of charge to users. In order to utilize valet bicycle parking, a developer must submit for the Planning Board\u2019s approval a plan describing: i. The design of the valet bicycle parking facilities (which shall not be required to conform with the dimensional regulations of Section 6.100). ii. The proposed number of attendants, number of bicycle parking spaces provided, hours of valet service operations, and other pertinent information. When an approved valet bicycle parking program that was utilized to meet the requirements of Section 6.100 is discontinued, the property owner must either bring the bicycle parking spaces into full conformance with the bicycle parking requirements of Section 6.100 or seek approval from the Planning Board for an alternative approach. The combination of the strategies above, or other provisions accepted by the Planning Board, shall allow a project to adjust the minimum required number of bicycle parking spaces, as supported through analysis made available to the Planning Board.",

WHEREAS: The City of Cambridge has employed several strategies to reduce the spread of COVID-19 through increased testing, contact tracing and mask and social distancing practices; and ---|--- WHEREAS: Due to these strategies, Cambridge\u2019s COVID-19 positivity rate has dropped from its peak of a 36.7 cases per day on a seven-day moving average in April, to now a 4.4 cases per day on seven-day moving average in September; and WHEREAS: One strategy to understand the impact of COVID-19 in our community more comprehensively is to capture the prevalence of antibodies in Cambridge residents; and WHEREAS: Serology testing is the test that looks for proteins in the blood called antibodies, which are produced in response to the presence of the virus, and the presence of these proteins indicate that someone\u2019s had the virus in the past; and WHEREAS: Serology testing is one part of a strategic, holistic approach to measuring the impact of COVID-19 in Cambridge, and is critical to inform our efforts to prevent the spread of the virus, as antibodies might also help us fight infections in the future; and WHEREAS: As we move forward through the next phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, it would be prudent to collect antibody information to thoroughly understand what the virus is doing in our community in order to get ahead and control it; and WHEREAS: Cities like Houston, Texas and Providence, Rhode Island, have launched an Antibody Testing Program to conduct random surveys and testing of individuals in their community; and WHEREAS: To date, Houston\u2019s Public Health Department and Fire Department have randomly sampled 420 homes across 60 census block groups with high and low COVID-19 positivity rates; and WHEREAS: WHEREAS: WHEREAS: The levels of antibodies can decrease over time, so antibody testing in multiple rounds is critical to collect the most accurate data; and Antibody testing programs can become costly, and similar antibody testing programs have received financial assistance from the CDC to carry out the labor and testing costs associated with this important data collection; and As we enter the winter months, battling both influenza and COVID-19, antibody testing for COVID-19 would be pertinent information to use as we assess our City\u2019s strategies against COVID-19 moving forward; now therefore be it ORDERED: That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to confer with Claude Jacob, Chief Public Health Officer, as to the feasibility of creating such a program and report back to the City Council on this matter by October 12, 2020.",

To be able to engage in all of these activities, Cambridge residents rely on the Charles River being clean and safe; and WHEREAS: These uses and benefits are possible today because significant resources have been invested over decades in restoring water quality in the Charles River. As climate change brings more extreme heat to our region, the benefits provided by the Charles River will only become more critical; and WHEREAS: Stormwater runoff, which carries phosphorus pollution, is the most significant threat to the health of the Charles River today. Phosphorus carried by stormwater into the Charles River degrades water quality and causes blooms of cyanobacteria, or blue-green algae; and WHEREAS: Cyanobacteria blooms are known to cause health effects including skin rashes, fever-like symptoms, respiratory or gastrointestinal distress, and in extreme cases, paralysis leading to death; and WHEREAS: Data indicate that cyanobacteria blooms are worsening each year and that the duration of the blooms is increasing, which [threatens safe recreation and public ](https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2020/06/25/charles-river- toxic-algae) [health](https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2020/06/25/charles-river- toxic-algae) along all 80 miles of the Charles River, including the Cambridge section of the river. In 2020, the Lower Basin, which is adjacent to Cambridge, has had a public health advisory in place since June 24; and WHEREAS: Currently-unregulated commercial, industrial, and large multi-unit developments, which make up only 20% of the land area in the Charles River watershed, contribute 50% of the stormwater pollution entering the Charles River. The ecological health of the Charles River cannot be fully restored unless these pollution sources are regulated under the Clean Water Act. Requiring large stormwater pollution sources to obtain permits under the Clean Water Act would also support the significant investments being made by municipalities to reduce stormwater runoff and phosphorus pollution; and WHEREAS: In 2019, Charles River Watershed Association and Conservation Law Foundation petitioned the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate large properties polluting the Charles River with stormwater runoff under the Clean Water Act; and WHEREAS: [EPA has indicated](https://www.crwa.org/uploads/1/2/6/7/126781580/epa_charles_river_stakeholder_letter_8132020.pdf) that it would like to engage with key stakeholders and explore the development of a workable and practical permitting approach, and has solicited feedback from relevant parties, including affected municipalities; now therefore be it RESOLVED: That the City Council go on record in support of requiring large sources of stormwater pollution in the Charles River watershed to obtain permits under the Clean Water Act in order to reduce phosphorus pollution and protect the health of the Charles River and those who use it.",

It will be important for us to consistently examine where we are to adapt our plans as necessary. In particular, there were many questions raised about the new COVID-19 Testing Program (here is the latest press release <https://www.cpsd.us/district_news/cambridge_public_schools__cambridge_public_health_>) that will be launching for our staff and students, particularly around ensuring that enough people will be tested, if the program is optional. While there are still many details that need to be ironed out, I am pleased that we are making significant process on this front. I hope to soon say the same about our progress with providing childcare options. I am continuing conversations with CPSD and DHSP on this matter and will share updates with you as they are available. I want to announce that my Office has partnered with the Work Force Program to bring Elevate Youth to Cambridge. Elevate Youth is a nonprofit that empowers underserved youth through regular outdoor experiences with the support of positive adult role models. This fall, we will be providing free and safe in- person outdoor programming for CPS students in grades 4 and 5 twice a week on Mondays and Wednesdays from September 23rd to October 28th at Danehy Park in North Cambridge and Sennott Park in the Port. Our participating youth will be led by older youth instructors, through the Work Force Program. We are focusing on 4th and 5th grade students who live close to these parks (or can secure transportation) and would not typically have the chance to experience the outdoors with a structured and supervised program. If you know anyone with children in our target population, please share this application <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd_w0gDQCkuMkYsuimMbcAUwyinSwRBXT20fYHUPOeXIuOaqg/viewform> with them ASAP. As you all know, my Office has been hosting Family Resource Fairs in partnership with CPS and the School Committee.

      "full_text": "A communication was received from Councillor Nolan, transmitting a memorandum on Filing for Reconsideration. Councillor Nolan Memorandum on why I filed for Reconsideration of the contract vote Arguably the most important vote the city council takes is on hiring a city manager. In my view, the vote taken earlier this week on the city manager (CM) contract was flawed, unclear, and warrants discussion with full transparency, which could not happen given the circumstances of a vote taken at 1 am based on a document distributed at that time. I requested an executive session to discuss the contract terms, and was told that could not happen without reconsideration. The only path to having a discussion of the terms was reconsideration. I believe and state unequivocally that it is the council, not the CM, who failed in this situation. Among the first meetings I attended as a city councillor were Government Operations Committee meetings where the question of a city manager contract was the agenda. On February 19, the topic was discussed and a letter from the CM stating that he was interested in a successor contract was accepted. It was explicitly stated that accepting the letter from the CM simply put on record that the committee had received it. At that meeting, the question of a review of the CM was mentioned, since the contract calls for one, led by the Government Operations Committee. I and several councillors advocated for a goal-setting and review process. It was recognized as good practice, good governance, and good modeling. On March 12, the same committee met again to discuss the city manager contract. During that meeting (full minutes here) there was discussion of what the process would be to move forward and how to proceed. There was a suggestion that the committee state it was interested in a one-year extension (that motion failed). There was discussion on what would happen over the next few months, how to start a search for a new CM, and other items. During that meeting the process outlined for the committee members, other councillors such as myself and the public was that the chair of the committee would be authorized \u201cto have a discussion with Mr. DePasquale regarding that request\u201d of a new contract. After such discussion, there would be an executive session for the full council to discuss what a contract might include. An \u201cexecutive session\u201d was mentioned eight times during the meeting. That is standard practice and in line with my experience on the School Committee and on other boards - after getting a sense of what is wanted in a contract, the full body meets in executive session to be apprised of any information relevant to opening negotiations, and review strategy and/or discuss possible terms that would be offered. The minutes of the March 12 meeting are very clear that the chair was authorized to open discussions only, and not to negotiate. The minutes of that meeting were on the July 27 council meeting, and presumably that meant that as of that date the chair was authorized to ask the CM what he wanted. Based on my own experience, my understanding of proper procedure and the explicit commitment at that meeting, I expected that before any contract would be offered the full council would weigh in, during an executive session. Instead, on our September 14 meeting agenda was a policy order from Councillor Simmons asking the council to extend the CM contract for 18 months \u201cwith a 2.5 percent cost of living adjustment at signing.\u201d There are several questions that arise from that recommendation. The chair was never authorized to engage in negotiations with the CM, only to discuss what he wanted, so why were we asked to vote on terms? And during discussion of this policy order, it became clear that the description of the compensation was wrong. A COLA is given to non-union staff in July of each year, and the CM received a 2.5% COLA adjustment on July 1, 2020. During our discussion, the council was told there were \u201cno changes\u201d, that the contract was an extension of the current contract, with \u201cwhat he gets anyway...following what he has in previous contracts as a cost of living\u201d. Yet the draft contract which was printed and given to council members after midnight WAS different. It included not just a COLA, but a separate 2.5% raise upon signing. Any potential contract should have been reviewed, discussed and jointly voted in executive session, as had been promised earlier in the year. I, as a new councillor, experienced with several contract negotiations with superintendents, was surprised and taken aback. How did a process which could and should have been professional and sensitive, become a public mess? Many of us expressed confusion about what the terms were, and whether they were appropriate. Many of us were exhausted, and while we wanted to respect the CM also wanted to recognize that the process through no fault of the CM, was disconcerting at best. The draft had some handwritten notes, some things scratched out, and an end date that matched with no specific logic. And it wasn\u2019t clear to me if we were voting on an actual contract or the rough outlines of one that could be finalized later. I did wonder over the course of August when we would go into an executive session - and I did reach out to several colleagues about when we would next hear about the contract. I never heard back and several colleagues also did not know. In retrospect, I should have asked why we hadn\u2019t had an executive session. We hadn\u2019t had a regular meeting since the July 27 meeting when the committee report authorizing the beginning of contract discussion was accepted. I know the CM was anxious to get this done, and he was told the process was fine. In my opinion, the council mishandled this process, not the CM. Why bother reconsidering since I am and was prepared to vote a contract for 18 months? I woke up the next day troubled. Troubled by a deeply flawed process that was undemocratic, unclear and counter to the good governance I promised to model and practice every day when I took the oath of office. And floored by the fact that several of us were not entirely sure what compensation package we were approving. The meeting video shows the confusion. From an assertion that nothing was different about this contract, that it was just an extension on the same terms with nothing new to an assertion that it included a double raise to a question on why the end date did not\u2019 match with anything, it was an embarrassing display that was not something the council should condone or tolerate or let stand. Especially in one of the most significant votes we take, we should be very clear that we know what the vote means. And, I am uncomfortable that it was not clear at that moment that the vote entailed a raise separate from a COLA. The public should have confidence that we are looking out for their interests and carefully monitoring spending of every dollar. We are in the middle of a pandemic and the financial situation of the city almost certainly will deteriorate over the next year or two. We may be asking our workers, our unions and our residents to tighten their belts, to lower expectations for what the city can offer. We should be conscious of every dollar. And yet, in these challenging times when everyone has been working overtime, many have lost their homes, their livelihoods and their savings, I cannot in good conscience approve a raise even of 2.5% on a salary that in my view is already far more than it should be. I reviewed the salaries of mayors and city managers of several cities across the country which are our size or in some cases a few times bigger and more complex, all of which have AAA bond ratings. None are paid as much any close to the current $323K (scheduled to go up to $339K next July 1) as Cambridge\u2019s City Manager. Most are paid much less. Both Mayor Walsh of Boston (AAA bond rated city) and Governor Baker make far less. I respect the CM and sincerely hope he will stay for the next 18 months. I wish we\u2019d only been asked to vote on a standard contract per the policy order as written, without an additional raise. Or that we\u2019d had an executive session. Then this reconsideration would not have been filed. Another note: Through my years of service on School Committee, I took the responsibility for overseeing the superintendent seriously. Many years back, when the School Committee failed to fulfill its obligation to conduct a review and got appropriate criticism, I vowed never to let that happen on my watch. I took over the role of ensuring the review of the superintendent happened. It was always a fruitful and helpful process - an opportunity to reflect on the past year, recognize and celebrate what went well and discuss how best to approach the coming year. That process is an essential part of any high functioning organization. I hope that will happen in the future with any city manager.",

The Y2Y shelter has been operating with non-student professional staff since that time.

Listed below are the recommendations of the Community Preservation Act Committee (CPAC) for FY2021. For additional information, please see attachments from the CPA Committee Chair, Lisa Peterson, dated September 10, 2020. The CPA process included a virtual public hearing held on July 1, 2020 to solicit proposals and ideas on CPA projects for FY2021. A second virtual public hearing was held on August 5, 2020 to solicit recommendations on the percentage of CPA funds allocated to each funding category: Affordable Housing, Historic Preservation, and Open Space. The CPAC also received several online submissions, e-mails and mailed comments regarding potential CPA projects and the allocation percentages. The CPAC, on September 9, 2020, voted 7-1 for an allocation of 80% for Affordable Housing, 10% for Historic Preservation projects and 10% for Open Space projects. In accordance with the CPAC\u2019s recommendations, I am requesting that the City Council appropriate a total of $15,330,000 in CPA funds raised by the City's FY2021 CPA surcharge, the FY2020 state match funds received in FY2021 and a portion of the existing CPA Fund Balance. For this appropriation, it is estimated that the net local receipts from the CPA surcharge for FY2021 will total $10,500,000, added to an anticipated FY2020 state match of $2,150,000 and an additional $2,670,000 from CPA Fund Balance.
