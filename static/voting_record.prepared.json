The one Planning Board case that has included new parking\nfacilities was the MIT Volpe Exchange Parcel Planned Unit Development (case\nPB-368 <https://www.cambridgema.gov/specialpermits/pb368>), which includes two\nlarge new below-grade parking garages. As a condition of the PUD special\npermit granted in July, MIT significantly increased the EVSE spaces originally\nproposed and committed to design all of its parking facilities to be EVSE-\nready and to initially equip 10% of spaces with EVSE chargers, and to monitor\ndemand annually in order to increase the number of EVSE chargers so that\nfuture EV users would be accommodated as demand increases.  \n  \nStaff will continue to work with applicants and the Planning Board to\nincorporate EVSE standards into new parking facilities for future projects.\n\n",

Listed below are the recommendations of the Community Preservation Act\nCommittee (CPAC) for FY2022. For additional information, please see\nattachments from the CPA Committee Chair, David Kale, dated September 15,\n2021.  \n  \nThe CPA process included a virtual public hearing held on June 12, 2021 to\nsolicit proposals and ideas on CPA projects for FY2022. A second virtual\npublic hearing was held on July 14, 2021 to solicit recommendations on the\npercentage of CPA funds allocated to each funding category: Affordable\nHousing, Historic Preservation, and Open Space. The CPAC also received several\nonline submissions and emailed comments regarding potential CPA projects and\nthe allocation percentages. The CPAC, on September 14, 2021, voted unanimously\nfor an allocation of 80% for Affordable Housing, 10% for Historic Preservation\nprojects and 10% for Open Space projects.  \n  \nIn accordance with the CPAC\u2019s recommendations, I am requesting that the City\nCouncil appropriate a total of $17,510,000 in CPA funds raised by the City's\nFY2022 CPA surcharge, the FY2021 state match funds received in FY2022 and a\nportion of the existing CPA Fund Balance.  \n  \nFor this appropriation, it is estimated that the net local receipts from the\nCPA surcharge for FY2022 will total $11,200,000, added to an anticipated\nFY2021 state match of $4,200,000 and an additional $2,110,000 from CPA Fund\nBalance.

DePasquale, City Manager, relative to a request for approval to submit an amendment to the proposed Home Rule Petition for a special law regarding a fire cadet program for the City of Cambridge Fire Department. I am writing to request your approval to submit the attached amendment to the\nproposed Home Rule Petition for a special law regarding a fire cadet program\nfor the City of Cambridge Fire Department. As background, on February 22,\n2021, the City Council approved Council Order No. 6 confirming that it favored\nthe filing of a Petition for a Special Law Regarding a Fire Cadet Program for\nthe City of Cambridge Fire Department (\u201cFire Cadet Legislation\u201d) in a similar\nmanner to the act which authorizes City of Cambridge police cadets, Chapter\n679 of the Acts of 1979 (\u201cPolice Cadet Legislation\u201d).  \n  \nThe Police Cadet Legislation was enacted in the aftermath of a 1979 case\ncalled Castro v. Beecher, in which approximately 90 municipalities in the\nCommonwealth were subject to federal civil rights litigation involving their\npractices in hiring police officers, and which required specific groupings of\npolice candidates at the time. Based upon the order in that case, the Police\nCadet Legislation included language stating that if \u201cany federal or state,\nadministrative or court order requires the listing of candidates in separate\ngroups, each group to be listed according to the laws of the commonwealth,\nthen this act shall be subject to such listing.\u201d Chapter 679 of the Acts of\n1979, at Section 2.  \n  \nThe proposed Fire Cadet Legislation, attached to Council Order No. 6 of\n2/22/2021, included similar language in Section 4 of such proposed legislation\nsince it was modeled after the Police Cadet Legislation. However, because the\ncompelled groupings which related to the court order in Castro v. Beecher are\nno longer applicable, and because it is implied that the City would have to\nfollow such inapplicable court order, inclusion of Section 4 in the proposed\nFire Cadet Legislation is superfluous and could create confusion. These\nchanges do not substantively affect the proposed Legislation.  \n  \nI am therefore requesting your approval to remove Section 4 from the proposed\nFire Cadet Legislation. I have attached a tracked changes version of the\nproposed amended Fire Cadet Legislation, as well as a clean copy for your\nreview and consideration.\n\n",

In June 2020 and again in November 2020, I requested and received the City\nCouncil\u2019s authorization to grant street obstruction approvals, which are\nrequired for restaurants to operate outdoor dining on the sidewalk or street,\nuntil sixty (60) days past the end of the state of emergency declared by the\nGovernor of Massachusetts due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. I sought this\nauthorization in order to respond to the restaurant community\u2019s need to expand\noutdoor dining services in response to the COVID-19 Pandemic, and consistent\nwith Governor Baker\u2019s COVID-19 Orders which authorized restaurants to expand\noutdoor dining through an expedited process until sixty (60) days past the end\nof the state of emergency. On May 28, 2021, Governor Baker issued COVID-19\nOrder No. 69 which among other things ordered that the statewide Declaration\nof a State of Emergency terminated as of June 15, 2021. Accordingly, my\nauthority to grant street obstruction approvals would expire August 14, 2021,\nexcept that because the City Council has granted the City Manager ongoing\nauthority during the summer months when the Council does not meet regularly,\nmy authority would expire on September 13, 2021.  \n  \nOn June 16, 2021, Governor Baker signed into law an Act Relative to Extending\nCertain COVID-19 Measures Adopted During the State of Emergency, and that Act\nextends the ability to approve an expansion of premises for outdoor dining\nthrough April 1, 2022, without having to undergo the full licensing process\nand notice requirements, and such outdoor dining does not have to comply with\nthe zoning act, G.L. c.40A. In light of the Act\u2019s extension of the expedited\noutdoor dining process the City has extended its temporary street and sidewalk\npatio license agreements until January 1, 2022. City staff has also been\nreviewing the City\u2019s normal outdoor dining process to find ways to improve the\nprocess to assist restaurants when the City\u2019s normal outdoor dining season\nresumes on March 1, 2022. Therefore, because the Act allows for the expedited\noutdoor dining process through April 1, 2022, and to allow the City to\ncontinue to respond to the restaurant community\u2019s need for outdoor dining in\nan expeditious manner, including in the spring as restaurants resume outdoor\ndining pursuant to the City\u2019s normal outdoor dining process, I am hereby\nrequesting that the City Council extend its prior authorization for me or my\ndesignee to grant all approvals for street temporary obstructions, until June\n30, 2022.\n\n",

Closing off this section of roadway would present tremendous\ntactical challenges for the Fire Department to adequately protect the city and\nrespond to calls from the community and is not acceptable from a fire safety\nperspective.\n\n\u00b7 The Engine Six firehouse on River Street is currently closed for repairs.\nWhile the Fire Department has adjusted their response plans to properly cover\nCambridgeport during this closure, any closure of Massachusetts Avenue could\ndelay the response of units and present an added risk to the community.\n\n\u00b7 The rerouting of various trucks and commercial vehicles onto smaller side\nstreets could also place the residents, pedestrians, and bicycles on those\nstreets at additional risk due to the multiple right-angle turns required for\nthat rerouting. It is also important to note that Massachusetts Avenue between\nSydney Street and Pleasant Street is part of the hazardous materials truck\nroute that must be used in place of the Prudential tunnel on the Massachusetts\nTurnpike (I-90), so any closure would move those trucks onto smaller streets\nand require additional turning movements through the early morning hours.\n\n  \n\u00b7 The Police Department expressed significant concerns regarding the recurring\nstaffing required to support such a closure, given the traffic and crowd\ncontrol that would be required to maintain a safe and organized closure\n(potentially including the need to deploy blocking trucks or hard barriers).\n\nBased on these concerns from public safety agencies, the City Solicitor also\nexpressed concerns regarding any such closure.  \n  \nStaff also consulted with service planning staff from the Massachusetts Bay\nTransportation Authority (MBTA), to understand their perspective on this idea.\nThe MBTA is not supportive of this recurring closure, particularly given the\nnumber of different bus routes, the volume of customers that travel in this\narea, and the transfer connections available to the Red Line. Specific\nconcerns include confusion for customers, the staffing and other resources\nrequired to plan and implement significant detours on multiple routes, bus\nstop relocation challenges, and the increased walking distance for\ntransferring customers, particularly those with disabilities.\n\nBased on all these concerns, I am not comfortable moving forward with a plan\nthat involves a full closure of Massachusetts Avenue between Sydney Street and\nProspect Street on Friday and Saturday evenings, as suggested in the original\nPolicy Order. However, the City remains supportive of implementing more\nlimited street closures, as we have done in other locations around the City in\nresponse to COVID-19 and to address other key needs, particularly where these\nclosures help directly support the vitality of local businesses and local\nneighborhoods. Within Central Square, we would be open to working with the\nCentral Square Business Improvement District (BID) and individual businesses\nto create additional spaces on side streets for outdoor dining, retail sales,\nor other supportive uses. In creating these spaces, we also need to be\nsensitive to the specific needs of these groups and nearby residents and\nensure that any changes recognize and respond both to the businesses\u2019\noperations as well as the residents\u2019 concerns. Implementation of any street\nclosures would also need to be done in a manner that increases the\nattractiveness of the area, which typically requires programming and\nactivation.  \n  \nWe are currently engaged with the Central Square BID and appropriate City\nstaff to discuss additional opportunities for side street closures that will\nhelp support the local businesses, residents and the Cultural District as a\nwhole.\n\n",

      "full_text": " A communication transmitted from Louis A. DePasquale, City Manager, relative to Awaiting Report Item Number 20-37, regarding renaming the Central Square Library. In response to Awaiting Report Item Number 20-37, regarding renaming the\nCentral Square Library, please find attached a legal opinion from City\nSolicitor Nancy E. Glowa in which she has opined that under the City\u2019s Plan\n\u201cE\u201d Charter, the authority to name or rename City buildings, including Library\nbuildings, rests with the City Manager.  \n  \nAs City Manager, I have been vested pursuant to the City\u2019s Charter with the\nresponsibility to supervise the administration of the affairs of the City,\nwhich includes responsibility for City buildings and therefore, the authority\nto name City buildings. I am mindful, however, that the naming of buildings is\nimportant to a broad number of constituencies within the City, including with\nrespect to Library buildings, the Library Board of Trustees. Prior to the\nCity\u2019s adoption of the Plan \u201cE\u201d Charter, the City enacted the Cambridge Public\nLibrary Ordinance in 1880, later amended to be named the Public Library\nDepartment Ordinance, Chapter 2.46 of the Municipal Code (the \u201cOrdinance\u201d.)\nUnder that ordinance, the Library Department had responsibility for the care,\ncustody and maintenance of Library buildings; however, its responsibility in\nthat regard was superseded by the City\u2019s adoption of the Charter.  \n  \nAlthough the responsibility for the library buildings, including the naming\nthereof, rests with me, I intend to appoint a task force as proposed that will\nundertake a study process to be followed in looking at the renaming of the\nCentral Square Library and the establishment of a new library collection that\ncenters Black Voices, at the suggestion of Library Director Maria McCauley, in\nconsultation with the Library Board of Trustees.  \n  \nLibrary recommendation regarding renaming the Central Square Library  \n  \nThe Council Order asked that the City Manager consult with the Cambridge\nPublic Library, the Library Board of Trustees, and any other appropriate City\npersonnel to consider formally renaming the Central Square Branch Library in\nhonor of Maria Baldwin and Representative John Lewis, with the building to be\nknown as \u201cThe Maria Baldwin and Rep. John Lewis Library and Center for African\nAmerican/Black History and Culture\u201d going forward, or to find another suitable\nlocation for this dedication. Library Director Maria McCauley, in consultation\nwith the Library Board of Trustees, has recommended the following study\nprocess to be employed in\n\n  \nconsidering whether to rename the Central Square Branch Library: that I\nappoint a task force to study this issue; that the task force create a process\nfor public input, such as conducting a survey and holding community meetings;\nthat the task force meet monthly, or on a designated regular schedule, until a\nreport of recommendations is made to the Library Director and the City\nManager. If the recommendation is to find another suitable location, another\ntask force may need to be created in order to further study that.  \n  \nOn the naming as a Center for African American/Black History and Culture  \n  \nDirector McCauley reports that the Central Square Branch Library has housed a\nsmall Black Studies Collection since 1979 and has also held an annual Dr.\nMartin Luther King Jr. Day Celebration since 1975 but that it has not (up to\nthis point) been designated in purpose or planning as a Center for African\nAmerican and Black History and Culture. It has functioned as a centrally\nlocated library branch that serves a diverse population, including ESOL\nstudents, children in after school programs, and residents in Central Square,\nincluding those in nearby affordable housing sites and those without permanent\nhousing.  \n  \nPrior to the issuance of this Council Order, Director McCauley and the Library\nDepartment had recommended that the City do a comprehensive building program\nstudy in the near future of the Central Square Branch Library, including its\npurpose and function and building design. It is anticipated that the central\nnature of the Central Square Branch Library will be studied in future in\nconnection with the proposed comprehensive building program study.  \n  \nDirector McCauley has recommended that the task force review the initial plans\nfor a collection that would center Black Voices, would represent the fullest\nrange of Black experiences possible, and would give input into this new\ncollection.  \n  \nBackground on the Black Studies Collection\n\n\u2022 Since 1979 the Central Square Branch has housed a Black Studies Collection\nlargely focused on academic and research materials. It does not include\nmaterials for children.\n\n\u00b7 The Black Studies Collection was originally grant funded along with eight\nother Ethnic Heritage Collections spread across the O\u2019Connell and Central\nSquare Branches.\n\n\u00b7 The Ethnic Heritage Collections did not have ongoing funding and over time\nwere phased out. Of the original collections, only the Black Studies\nCollection remains.\n\n\u00b7 The most items ever contained in the Black Studies Collection was 750. As\ncondition, relevance, and usage decreased, the collection shrank. In 2010,\nthere were less than 400 items included. There are currently about 150 items\nin the collection.\n\n  \nThe new Black Voices Collection  \n  \nOver the past year, Library staff have been working on initial planning to\ncreate a Black Voices collection to refresh the outdated Black Studies\ncollection with a vibrant, living collection.\n\nThe new Black Voices Collection\u2019s intent will be to:\n\n\u00b7 Create a collection that centers Black Voices and represents the fullest\nrange of Black experiences possible.\n\n\u00b7 Collect print materials across age ranges with a focus on popular materials,\nbrowsable collections, and circulation.\n\n\u00b7 Collect a mix of fiction, genre, memoir, biography, and popular non-fiction.\nSome titles may reside in multiple Library locations\n\n\u00b7 Engage the community in both the selection of titles and ongoing promotion\nof the collection.\n\n  \nThe Library Department also has a commitment to documenting African American\nand Black residents in Cambridge as part of its archival and local history\nwork related to the Cambridge Room, which is housed at the Main Library.\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad  \n  \nSuggestions for a task force:  \n  \nDirector McCauley has recommended that the task force include one or more\nLibrary Assistant Directors, Library Trustees, City Councilors, Black and\nBrown community leaders, Latinx community leaders, representative(s) of the\nCentral Square BID, student representative(s), including someone from the\nFamily Policy Council, representative(s) of the Port neighborhood,\nrepresentative(s) of the Cambridgeport neighborhood, representative(s) of the\nCambridge Public Library Foundation and representative(s) of the Cambridge\nCommunity Foundation.  \n\nI intend to appoint members to this task force shortly, and to ask them to\nbegin the study work as outlined above. When there is a recommendation on the\nquestions posed, I will report back to the City Council and ask for your\nsupport of the proposed renaming of the Central Square Library at that time.\n\n",

DePasquale, City Manager, relative to a request the adoption of a statutory small business exemption for personal property accounts equal to or less than $10,000.00 in assessed value and the authorization for an exemption for personal property accounts equal to or less than $20,000.00 in assessed value, by requesting a special act from the Legislature and the Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Based upon a review of the City of Cambridge\u2019s (\u201cCity\u201d) personal property\naccounts, in April of 2020, I recommended adoption by the City Council of a\nstatutory small business exemption for personal property accounts equal to or\nless than $10,000.00 in assessed value, which the City Council approved. The\n$10,000.00 personal property tax exemption has been effective for Fiscal Year\n2021, which exempted 1,194 small businesses from receiving a personal property\ntax bill.  \n  \nAt the same time, I also recommended that the City seek authorization for an\nexemption for personal property accounts equal to or less than $20,000.00 in\nassessed value, by requesting a special act from the Legislature and the\nGovernor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. These recommendations were one\npart of a plan to help small businesses through a combination of programs\nincluding small business initiatives, grants, workshops and tax relief,\nparticularly with respect to our effort to assist small businesses that have\ndealt with, and are continuing to deal with, the ramifications of COVID-19.  \n  \nOn April 6, 2020, the City Council accepted my recommendation and ordered that\nI work with the City Solicitor to draft a home rule petition to authorize the\nCity to provide a personal property tax exemption of up to $20,000.00 of\nvalue, which we completed and submitted to the General Court. The General\nCourt approved the proposed home rule petition, and on January 7, 2021,\nChapter 282 of the Acts of 2020 (\u201cAct\u201d) passed (attached), which allows the\nCity of Cambridge to permit a $20,000 personal property tax exemption upon\nacceptance of the Act by the City Council by majority vote.  \n  \nFor fiscal year 2020, the City had 2,576 personal property accounts. Of those,\n62% had an assessed value of $20,000.00 or less, which represented just 0.54\npercent of the overall personal property valuation in the City of $1.679\nbillion dollars. For the coming fiscal year, we anticipate that over 1,500\nsmall businesses would be exempted from receiving a personal property tax bill\nif the City adopts the $20,000.00 exemption. Not only will this tax exemption\nassist small businesses financially and administratively, but it will also\nrelieve the burden upon the City for the collection and accounting of small\naccounts. I therefore respectfully request that the City Council accept the\nprovisions of this Act so that the City can start the process of permitting\nthe $20,000 personal property tax exemption for the coming fiscal year.  \n\n  \nAttached is a proposed order that would provide for the City Council to adopt\nChapter 282 of the Acts of 2020 to allow the City to establish a personal\nproperty tax exemption in the amount of $20,000.00 for the coming fiscal year\nand going forward.\n\n",

I am writing to request that you approve the acquisition of land in Lincoln,\nMassachusetts for the purpose of adding to the City\u2019s watershed lands for\nwater supply protection and conservation purposes. The City of Cambridge has\nthe opportunity to purchase from the Lincoln Rural Land Foundation two parcels\nof land numbered 4 Twin Pond Lane, Assessor\u2019s parcels #180-13-0 and #180-11-0,\nin the Town of Lincoln (\u201cthe Property\u201d) consisting of 7.79 + acres of\nundeveloped land for the purposes of protecting the City\u2019s drinking water\nsupply and for land conservation. The Lincoln Rural Land Foundation is in the\nprocess of purchasing the property at a discount this month from private\nowners. The Property is appraised at $1,000,000. The private owners are\nselling it to the Lincoln Rural Land Foundation for $800,000. The Lincoln\nRural Land Foundation would then convey the Property in fee to the City. The\n$800,000 cost of conveyance from the Lincoln Rural Land Foundation to the City\nwould be broken down as follows. The Lincoln Rural Land Foundation would\ncontribute $200,000, effectively reducing its sale price to $600,000. The Town\nof Lincoln will contribute $200,000 toward the sale price. The Lincoln Rural\nLand Foundation will further contribute $200,000 of funds that were privately\nfundraised for this purpose. The City will pay only $200,000 plus costs and\nwill obtain the fee interest in the Property. However, the City has applied to\nthe State for a grant to cover the cost of the City's full share of this\nacquisition, being the $200,000 purchase price plus costs. If the City does\nnot receive the grant, I will request an appropriation from the Water Fund. As\na condition of the contributions by the private owners, the Lincoln Rural Land\nFoundation, the Town of Lincoln, and the State grant, the Property must be\npermanently protected by a conservation restriction as provided by G.L.c.184,\n\u00a7\u00a731-33.\n\nThe Cambridge Water Board voted unanimously on May 11, 2021 to recommend that\nthe City purchase the Property for purposes of water supply protection and\nconservation. A copy of the Water Board\u2019s vote is attached.\n\nI recommend that the City Council authorize the City Manager to purchase the\nProperty on behalf of the City of Cambridge for water supply protection and\nconservation purposes from previously appropriated funds, and to execute any\nand all necessary documents on behalf of the City to effectuate this purchase\nin such form and substance as the City Manager determines is necessary or\nadvisable.  \n\n  \nI further recommend that the City Council vote to diminish the full\ndisposition process pursuant to Cambridge City Code \u00a72.110.010(g) for the\ndisposition of the property interest to be granted by the City through the\nconservation restriction to the Lincoln Conservation Commission. I recommend\nthat the City Council vote to grant the permanent conservation restriction for\nthe purpose of protecting the Property from development and from other uses\nthat might be detrimental to the City\u2019s water supply and conservation\npurposes, and vote to authorize the City Manager to execute any and all\nnecessary documents on behalf of the City related to the conservation\nrestriction in such form and substance as the City Manager determines is\nnecessary or advisable.\n\nA copy of a plan drawn by Snelling & Hamel showing the location of the parcel\nis also attached.

      "full_text": " A petition was received from Loren Crowe, requesting that the City Council ordain ordinance language relative to the creation and operation of Neighborhood Conservation Districts in the city.  REFERRED TO THE ORDINANCE COMMITTEE IN COUNCIL MAY 25, 2021 To the Honorable City Council:\n\nThe undersigned registered Cambridge voters respectfully request that the City\nCouncil ordain the ordinance language set forth below relative to the creation\nand operation of Neighborhood Conservation Districts in the city.\n\nDiversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Access\n\n21st Century Values for Neighborhood Conservation Districts\n\nWe invite you to join us in asking the City to improve the way that we create\nand operate Neighborhood Conservation Districts in Cambridge. Intended to\nserve the worthy goals of helping communities to preserve historic structures\nand maintain neighborhoods as they are, Neighborhood Conservation Districts\nhave too often been exploited unfairly as a means by which tiny,\nunrepresentative groups of residents can exploit our city ordinances to\ncontrol their neighbors\u2019 choices and housing options. Recently in Cambridge,\nwe have seen small groups of homeowners initiate the process of establishing\nnew Neighborhood Conservation Districts in order to raise their property\nvalues, settle interpersonal disputes, and restrict development potential\nbelow even that allowed by zoning. None of those purposes matches Cambridge\u2019s\nvalues, and yet that behavior is currently enabled by our City ordinances.\n\nThe current ordinance language was drafted 40 years ago and needs to be\nupdated to reflect modern community values related to diversity, access,\nequity, representation, and inclusion. The ordinance governing the creation\nand operation of Neighborhood Conservation Districts currently allows just ten\nunrepresentative residents to launch a lengthy study of a Conservation\nDistrict in an area that might be home to thousands of residents and burden\ntheir homes with binding rules. A study can be initiated by the appointed\nmembers Cambridge Historical Commission without any input or say so from our\ndemocratically elected City Council. A study places binding rules on a\nneighborhood from the Historical Commission that no one in the neighborhood\noutside of the Historical Commission\u2019s Study Commission has approved of or\nconsented to, and, according to an opinion issued by City Solicitor Nancy\nGlowa, those rules can remain in place for as many years as the Historical\nCommission wants to study them. The membership appointed to the Neighborhood\nConservation District Commissions in no way reflects the diversity of their\nneighborhoods with age, race, ethnicity, renter status, or a host of other\nfactors, tending to confer additional power and privilege to the already\npowerful and privileged.\n\nThis petition proposes changes to the ordinance governing the creation and\noperation of Neighborhood Conservation Districts with a view to increasing the\ndemocratic legitimacy of our Conservation Districts by empowering the members\nof the neighborhoods they govern and by introducing essential democratic\nchecks and balances to the process. The main goals of this petition are:\n\n  \n\n\u00b7 Increasing the democratic threshold required to begin a Conservation\nDistrict Study\n\n\u00b7 Ensuring that the goals of Neighborhood Conservation District are balanced\nwith other City goals of diversity, equity, and inclusion in all City\nneighborhoods and the need to address the housing supply and cost crisis\n\n\u00b7 Ensuring that the democratically elected City Council has a voice in\nstarting a new study\n\n\u00b7 Ensuring that the Neighborhood Conservation District Commissions and the\nrules governing Neighborhood Conservation Districts are reflective of the\ndiversity of our neighborhoods\n\n\u00b7 Ensuring that no binding rules are imposed on neighborhoods without the\nconsent of the governed\n\nWe find no fault with the intent behind the original ordinance language, and\nwe believe that it likely represented the best thinking of the times to solve\na social problem of importance to the community. However, the world has\nlearned a lot in the past forty years. Everyone in this city has learned a\nlot. And we believe that the ordinance changes proposed below will help to\nbetter accomplish the ordinance\u2019s original goals by modernizing our\nNeighborhood Conservation Districts in accordance with our modern values and\nincreased understanding of the moral requirement for diversity, access,\naffordability, equity, representation, and inclusion throughout community\nlife.\n\n  \nWe respectfully request ordination of the below changes to the language of\nChapter 2.78 Article III. Underlined sections represent the petitioners\u2019\nproposed new wording and struck through sections represent proposed deletions.\n\nThe primary point of contact for this petition is Loren Crowe of 8 Museum Way,\nApartment #508 Cambridge, MA 02141. He can be reached at 760-522-2101 or\n[lorencrowe@gmail.com](mailto:lorencrowe@gmail.com).\n\nChapter 2.78 - HISTORICAL BUILDINGS AND LANDMARKS\n\nArticle III.

DePasquale, City Manager, relative to Awaiting Report Item Number 20-58, regarding a report on creating a comprehensive digital, postal, and traditional media outreach campaign educating residents on the Cambridge eviction moratorium, tenants' rights, and resources available to at-risk tenants. In response to Awaiting Report Item Number 20-58, regarding a report on\ncreating a comprehensive digital, postal, and traditional media outreach\ncampaign educating residents on the Cambridge eviction moratorium, tenants'\nrights, and resources available to at-risk tenants, Housing Liaison Maura\nPensak reports the following:  \n  \nSince April 20, the Public Information Office, in coordination with the City\nManager\u2019s Housing Liaison, Cambridge Public Schools, Department of Human\nService Programs, Community Development, and others, has implemented a\nmultichannel campaign to educate residents about the Cambridge eviction\nmoratorium, tenants\u2019 rights, and resources available to residents.  \n  \nCity Website:  \n  \nIn addition to posting news items on the City\u2019s website and highlighting them\non the homepage, information was added to the COVID-19 Housing Resources page\nearly in the pandemic and additional information was posted to a dedicated\npage created at www.cambridgema.gov/tenantsrights\n<http://www.cambridgema.gov/tenantsrights> to share more specific information\nand resources. To call out the information more prominently, a website banner\nimage was developed with the help of the Information Technology Department and\nplaced at the top of the homepage of the City\u2019s website at www.cambridgema.gov\n<http://www.cambridgema.gov/>  \n  \nIn addition, a landing page for the Housing Liaison Office is being created to\nprovide a space for general housing information to be accessed. The page will\ndirect residents to specific services and resources for housing and housing\nrelated concerns of all types.  \n  \nDirect Mail/Publications:  \n  \nInformation was included in several City of Cambridge publications mailed\ndirectly to all households in Cambridge. Specifically, information on the\nmoratorium and housing resources appeared in several parts of the May 2020\nCityView mailer, information on the Housing resources information line and\nhousing stabilization fund in the September 2020 edition of The Cambridge Life\nMagazine, an article on the eviction moratorium and tenant protection was\nhighlighted in the November 2020 CityView mailer, and the January 2021 edition\nof The Cambridge Life had a half-page callout on the back cover dedicated to\nthe eviction moratorium and tenants rights and resources. Housing resources\nwere also included in several direct mailers related to the COVID-19 pandemic\nand City resources that were mailed to households in 2020.  \n  \nSocial Media:  \n  \nInformation has been posted and reposted to the City\u2019s Twitter account,\nFacebook page, and Nextdoor account many times throughout the pandemic. This\ninformation has been amplified and shared by other City departments, community\npartners, and followers.  \n  \nPress Outreach:  \n  \nA press release was sent to our media list targeting Cambridge, regional, and\nother news outlets with information about the Tenant\u2019s Rights ordinance and\nstories were published in several publications.  \n  \nEmail Outreach:  \n  \nIn addition to information added to City\u2019s Daily Email update sent to\napproximately 18,000 subscribers, the City Manager\u2019s Office consulted with the\nCommunity Development, Inspectional Services, and others to curate a list of\nCambridge property owners and managers. This list has over 800 contacts and\nwas emailed directly with information related to the ordinance, their\nresponsibilities, and materials to post in their buildings, etc.  \n  \nMultilingual Materials:  \n  \nTranslated information related to the eviction moratorium and tenants\u2019 rights\nappears in multiple languages (Amharic, Arabic, Bangla, Chinese, Haitian\nCreole, Portuguese, Spanish) in the CityView publications and multilingual\nflyers with information were created and posted on the tenants\u2019 rights website\nand for partners to distribute those they serve.  \n  \nCambridge Public Schools:  \n  \nThe City Manager\u2019s Housing Liaison has connected with the School Department\nfor their assistance sharing information with families. Housing information\nwas included in several of the Superintendent\u2019s message and other email\ncommunications to families. A flier/handout was created, translated into\nmultiple languages, and provided to the school department to disseminate to\nstudents and families with housing resources and information.  \n  \nOther:  \n  \nA flier/handout was created, translated into multiple languages, and shared\nwith DHSP to disseminate through Fuel Assistance and Community Learning Center\nmailings and information.  \n  \nOngoing Education, Promotion, and Monitoring:  \n  \nThis past month, The City Manager\u2019s Office, Community Development Department,\nHuman Rights Commission and the Department of Human Service Programs\u2019 Multi-\nService Center have launched a city-wide campaign: Housed In Cambridge:\nInformation to Open Doors. This Campaign is designed to educate and inform\nresidents on housing opportunities and housing related resources and services\nand will include webinars, an interactive on-line housing guide and story map,\na social media campaign and information materials. To date, 3 webinars have\nbeen presented during the past 3 weeks as part of Fair Housing month.\nBeginning in June, monthly webinars and trainings will be offered.  \n  \nWe will continue to mention this information in our Daily Email Updates, via\nthe City\u2019s social media accounts and website, and in City publications where\nappropriate. In addition, the City Manager\u2019s Housing Liaison is planning to\nwork with the Public Information Office, Community Development, and others to\nstreamline information about housing on the City\u2019s website and produce\nadditional video, print, and other materials for dissemination. Communications\nwill continue to be sent to our property owner and management list quarterly\nto remind them of their obligations.  \n  \nIn anticipation of an uptick in eviction proceedings when the state moratorium\nwas lifted, City staff began biweekly meetings with legal service\norganizations as well as pulling information on proceedings taking place.\nThankfully, numbers have been very low in Cambridge, and we believe this is\ndue in part to the strong and ongoing partnerships the City has built and\ncontinues to build with property management companies. They have helped get\nhousing resource information to tenants to call the City for assistance before\nit\u2019s too late, and the assistance provided directly to residents through the\nMayor\u2019s Disaster Relief Fund and the Housing Stabilization Program has helped\nresidents tremendously.  \n  \nWe will stay vigilant and continue to monitor trends and communicate important\nhousing-related information to the community as there is some concern about\nupticks we may see in the coming months as additional assistance runs out.\n\n",

      "full_text": " A communication transmitted from Louis A. DePasquale, City Manager, relative to additional information on a Acoustic Music response currently on the Table. Following the City Council\u2019s discussion during its February 22, 2021 meeting\nregarding the above-referenced matters, the Cambridge Board of License\nCommissioners (the \u201cBoard\u201d) met on March 1 and 9, 2021 to discuss the question\nof filing a home rule petition seeking special legislation (the \u201cHome Rule\nPetition\u201d) that would authorize the City to allow establishments to have\nacoustic music performances at their premises without first obtaining a\nlicense from the Board. The Board had previously discussed this matter on\nFebruary 10, 2021, and the Board\u2019s Chair informed the City Council during the\nCouncil\u2019s February 22 Meeting that the Board did not support filing such a\nHome Rule Petition. A copy of the March 9, 2021 memorandum from the Chair of\nthe Board (the \u201cBoard\u2019s Memo\u201d) outlining the Board\u2019s position after the\nadditional Board meetings is attached for reference.  \n  \nAs outlined in the Board\u2019s Memo, after discussing the proposed Home Rule\nPetition during two of its subsequent meetings, the Board\u2019s position remains\nunchanged and the Board does not support such legislation regardless of the\ntype of business it would apply to. The Board remains concerned about the\nsafety implications of allowing such performances without a license,\nincluding, but not limited to, blocking of ingress and egress, compliance with\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act, overcrowding, and the safety of\nemployees, patrons, and first responders. The Board is also concerned about\nthe noise implications of allowing such performances without a license.  \n  \nHowever, in its discussions about this issue, the Board recognized that the\nCity Council\u2019s intent is for this amenity to be available to be used more\nwidely by businesses that would not necessarily apply for this type of\nlicense, i.e. bookstores, markets, etc. The Board also discussed the fact that\nthe Cambridge Zoning Ordinance currently does not allow live acoustic music\nperformances in most districts of the City without the property owner first\nobtaining a variance. I understand that a petition to amend the Zoning\nOrdinance (the \u201cZoning Petition\u201d) is presently pending and was discussed at\nthe Ordinance Committee on April 14, 2021 and that if enacted, the Zoning\nPetition would allow businesses with an existing primary non-residential use\nto have live or recorded entertainment as an additional primary use at their\npremises provided that the additional use does not exceed twenty-five percent\n(25%) of the gross floor area or provided that\n\n  \nthe entertainment is limited in duration to no more than twenty-five percent\n(25%) of the total hours of operation of the other principal non-residential\nuse. If enacted, this change, together with the following relaxed process\nrelating to the issuance of licenses for this use, would make processing\napplications for such licenses faster and more efficient.  \n  \nProvided live acoustic music becomes an additional allowed principal use at a\nnon-residential property by the above-referenced proposed zoning change, the\nBoard would create an application for a license for live acoustical music with\nno amplification except for one microphone, which would be used by businesses\nnot generally licensed under G.L. c. 138 or 140. That application would be\nreviewed simultaneously by staff from the License Commission, Fire and\nInspectional Services, and upon approval by Fire and Inspectional Services,\nthe license would be administratively issued by License Commission staff after\npayment of a nominal fee, ($25.00/3 months, $100.00/annually), without a\nhearing before the Board.  \n  \nIn addition, in terms of immediate relief, the Board voted to eliminate the\nrequirement to advertise applications for annual entertainment licenses,\nincluding live entertainment, in a newspaper. This will eliminate the cost of\nadvertising and delay caused by having these applications advertised but will\nstill allow for the public process. Notification will now be made to abutters\nseven (7) days prior to the hearing, to allow abutters to attend or submit\ncomments to the Board prior to the hearing, and an affidavit of notice to\nabutters will be required to be submitted with the annual application. Also,\nas of 2022, the annual license/renewal fee for acoustical music with no\namplification except for one microphone for all license types will be reduced\nfrom $500.00 annually to $100.00 annually. The Board will continue to work\nwith the City Solicitor to determine whether this change can be implemented in\n2021.  \n  \nFinally, the Board has suggested that the City Council consider adopting the\nBoard\u2019s recommendation to amend the Noise Ordinance to establish a more\nstreamlined mechanism for ticketing violations of the Noise Ordinance due to\nthe noise generated by acoustical performances by responding Police Officers\nor Inspectors/Investigators from the License Commission, Fire, or Inspectional\nServices Departments, rather than having those issues be presented to the\nBoard for a hearing prior to the issuance of a ticket for a violation.  \n  \nGiven the Board\u2019s concerns about the issuance of the Home Rule Petition, for\nthe reasons outlined above, in addition to those set forth in the Board\u2019s\nattached Memo, I do not support issuance of the Home Rule Petition at this\ntime; but I believe implementation of the above changes will streamline the\nprocess for obtaining such licenses as requested by the Council.\n\n",

PLACED ON THE TABLE IN COUNCIL MAY 17, 2021 In response to Awaiting Report Item Number 21-13, regarding next steps on\nimplementation of Universal Pre-K, received from Assistant City Manager for\nHuman Services Ellen Semonoff reports the following:\n\nThe Birth to 3rd Grade (B3) Partnership is an organized system of support with\nthe vision to ensure that high quality, early learning experiences are\naffordable and accessible to all children and families creating a seamless\nexperience beginning with prenatal care through the early elementary years.\nThrough these experiences, children will maximize their full potential\nacademically, socially, emotionally, and physically.\n\nIn the five years since its inception, the cornerstones of Birth to 3rd Third\nGrade Partnership\u2019s work has included (1) funding scholarships for\npreschoolers from low-income families so that they may attend high quality\npreschool at one of over a dozen community-based early learning centers; (2)\nthe quality improvement program that supports early learning centers and home-\nbased child care providers in achieving higher levels of quality through\ncoaching, mentoring, and funding for upgraded materials; (3) professional\ndevelopment for the early childhood workforce that includes access to college\ncoursework, professional learning communities, communities of practice, and\n(4) workshops on a variety of content areas; and strengthening the connection\nbetween the early childhood community and health, mental health, and home\nvisiting programs across the city.\n\nThe work to begin development of a Universal Pre-K (UPK) plan was intended to\nfollow the December 2019 Roundtable with the City Council and School Committee\nwhere the City Manager and Superintendent of Schools and their teams presented\nthe report of the Universal Pre-Kindergarten Study commissioned by the City\nand Schools. That report analyzed and evaluated two different models of UPK\nprograms for four-year olds and recommended a preferred model and a framework\nof essential elements required to build a high quality UPK system. The\npreferred model, which was endorsed by the City Manager and Superintendent of\nSchools, was a mixed-delivery system in which UPK would be offered through a\nnetwork of providers, including the Cambridge Public Schools, Human Services\nand community-based programs. This was the most common model nationally and is\nthe model being proposed by the Biden Administration in its proposed plan.\n\n  \nThe report identified the critical elements of high quality UPK programs\nincluding:\n\n\u00b7 Meets the needs of families in term of location, hours, and weeks of care\n\n\u00b7 Equity of access\n\n\u00b7 Diverse, competent and consistent staff\n\n\u00b7 Research-based curriculum\n\n\u00b7 Developmentally appropriate indoor and outdoor learning spaces\n\n\u00b7 Systems for establishing quality criteria and on-going evaluation\n\n\u00b7 Robust family engagement and services\n\nRight now, programs that serve 4 year-olds include the CPS JK, Special Start,\nScholars College and Montessori Programs, DHSP preschool programs, community-\nbased programs, for-profit programs and family childcare. One of the biggest\nchallenges today is that Cambridge does not have enough capacity in high\nquality programs to serve all 4 year-olds. Addressing this capacity issue\nrequires addressing a number of issues including:\n\n\u00b7 Increasing the number of existing programs that meet the state quality\nrating standards\n\n\u00b7 Expanding the number of Cambridge children served by Cambridge-based\nproviders that also serve children from outside Cambridge\n\n\u00b7 Exploring changes in JK-K school programs to create 4 year-old classrooms\n\n\u00b7 Increasing slots for 4 year-olds without displacing slots for 3 year-olds\n\n\u00b7 Developing a pipeline of qualified teachers and career pathways with a focus\non a diverse workforce\n\n\u00b7 Increasing workforce compensation\n\n\u00b7 Implementing evidence-based curriculum\n\nThe City Manager committed at the December meeting that the City would begin\nthe process to create a Universal Pre-Kindergarten Program for Cambridge\u2019s 4\nyear-olds. He acknowledged then that there were multiple issues and decisions\nthat would need to be addressed over the coming years and that the annual\noperating costs for such a program could ultimately exceed 20 million dollars,\nnot including capital costs for any additional city or school classrooms.\n\nThe initial steps identified that evening to begin the process included:\n\n\u00b7 Convening community-based providers for feedback and input\n\n\u00b7 Convening Principals and JK/K teachers for feedback and input\n\n\u00b7 Gathering additional data from Cambridge programs to understand how many\nprogram slots are filled by Cambridge children and how many slots which are\nnot dedicated to Cambridge children could become dedicated\n\n\u00b7 Gathering more data about the Cambridge pre-school workforce including\ncredentials and compensation\n\n\u00b7 Gathering information and feedback from families about their needs and\ninterests\n\n  \n\nBefore the pandemic upended services and planning, there was a convening with\nthe City Manager and the Superintendent of Schools and their teams with over\n80 leaders and staff of community-based providers. In that session, there was\nlots of excitement and numerous concerns about how the creation of UPK, even\nas a mixed delivery system, would impact existing programs. For example, most\nprograms serve 3 and 4 year-olds in mixed age classrooms and concerns were\nexpressed about whether a new system would require serving 4 year olds\nseparately. We made the commitment then to continue to work with programs as\nwe moved forward.\n\nNone of the additional steps that would have begun in 2020 or been continued\nin 2021 were able to move forward because of the impact of the pandemic.\nTeachers and Principals were focused appropriately on serving students\nvirtually and then in person. Community-Based programs were struggling to\nfigure out how and whether to re-open. Those programs that re-opened were\nserving smaller groups of children and so gathering data about slots, who was\nin them and how that might be able to be changed did not make sense during the\npandemic.\n\nWhile it is still a challenging moment for schools and preschool programs, we\nexpect to be able to begin the planning work as we had hoped to do in 2020.\nThe list of tasks to begin the work remains the same. And many critical\nefforts did move forward despite the pandemic that support the city\u2019s effort\nto expand high quality preschool opportunities for 4 year-olds.\n\nFirst, the City has continued to explore opportunities to expand capacity for\npre-school programs serving 3 and 4 year-olds. As the City Council knows, Just\na Start has been working on expanding its housing development at 402 Rindge\nAvenue together with additional space for employment and training and other\ncommunity needs. The City has been working with Just A Start to support\ncreation of 4 additional preschool classrooms that would serve some of the\nunmet need for preschools, especially in North Cambridge. Just A Start is also\nengaged in planning around another housing development on New Street and the\nCity has been working with Just A Start to explore whether two additional\npreschool classrooms could be built as part of that development. These\nclassrooms are in addition to the 4 new classrooms being designed as part of\nthe Tobin/Vassal Lane project.\n\nSecond, the City committed to funding the expansion of Head Start\u2019s four\nCambridge classrooms to full-day, full-year programs to better meet the needs\nof low-income families. Head Start was not able to open in person over the\nlast year but has continued to support children and families virtually. Head\nStart is working with the Birth to 3rd Partnership now to reopen sites for the\nfall. In addition, the City has been working with the Cambridge Housing\nAuthority to renovate or replace the Head Start classrooms as part of the\nJefferson Park housing development so that the spaces for Head Start will be\nexemplary early childhood classrooms.\n\nThird, the City has through its own preschool programs shifted both the cost\nstructure and the economic mix of the families represented in the programs. As\na result of the preschool lottery, 50% of the children served through the City\nprograms are now low income. The tuition each family pays is based on their\nincome so that depending on family income, tuition is between 1% and 8% of\nfamily income.\n\n  \nFourth, the Birth to 3rd Grade Partnership has also created a new School\nReadiness Manager position that is in the process of being filled. The School\nReadiness Manager will lead the effort to ensure a seamless transition from\nthe wide variety of early childhood settings in the community to the public\nschool system. A key role of this individual will be to support the Executive\nDirector in the UPK planning work. The Executive Director will work closely\nwith the Assistant Superintendent for Elementary Education, the School\nDepartment\u2019s Chief Financial Officer and the Assistant City Manager for Human\nServices in moving forward the planning process. We look forward to reporting\nback to the City Council and to the School Committee on the progress of that\nwork.\n\nAlthough the planning work has not moved forward, it is important not to lose\nsight of how critically important the Birth to 3rd Grade Partnership has been\nthis year in helping to prevent an even greater loss of programming for young\nchildren. Although the expansion of programming and the launching of the UPK\nplanning process was impacted by the pandemic, the Birth to 3rd team was able\nto provide deep support to its program quality and scholarship sites without\nhaving any of those sites permanently close as happened with other early\nchildhood providers within the city, state, and nationally. Community-based\nearly childhood programs and home-based providers alike credit the guidance\nand support of The Birth to 3rd Grade Partnership for their ability to adjust\nto the changing state child care requirements, continue to serve children and\nfamilies, and to survive and thrive during the very tumultuous public health\nand economic crisis this year has brought; a time in which equity and access\nacross our society became glaringly more evident. This qualitative information\ndemonstrates the positive impact the work of the Birth to 3rd Grade\nPartnership has on the early childhood workforce, children, families, and the\nbroader community.\n\n",

With more than 800\nCRLS students having returned on Monday, nearly 4,100 students (61% of all CPS\nstudents) are learning in-person.\n\nThese last 15 months have been long and challenging, and we are so proud of\nthe hard work, resilience, and patience of our scholars, families, and\neducators, who have made in-person and remote learning successful.\n\nOn Thursday, May 6th, the School Committee had a Special Meeting to appoint\nthe Interim Superintendent for the upcoming school year. The Committee voted\nto select Dr. Victoria Greer as Interim Superintendent of Schools. This\nappointment is conditioned on the ability of the School Committee and Dr.\nGreer to reach a negotiated contract. On May 11th, the School Committee met\nfor the purpose of voting on the retention of an attorney to begin contract\nnegotiations and entered into an executive session for the purpose of\ndiscussing strategy for contract negotiations for the Interim Superintendent.\nOn May 11th, our Student Members Nuriel Vera-DeGraff and Ana\u00efs Killian also\nhosted a Zoom Meet the School Committee event for CRLS students. Students\nasked questions about the School Committee\u2019s roles and our work thus far.\n\nCPS has updated two COVID-19 policies:\n\n\u00b7 Elementary level quarantines will not be automatic: in alignment with\nupdated state guidance, CPS elementary school classrooms will not\nautomatically close and quarantine in situations with a confirmed case.\nInstead, only those individuals within 3 feet of distance of the positive\nindividual for a total of 15+ minutes during a 24-hour period will be directed\nto quarantine\n\n\u00b7 Quarantine period reduced from 10 days to 7 days: in alignment with\nquarantine protocols provided by private medical providers, Cambridge Public\nHealth Department protocols, and the CDC, CPS quarantine periods will now last\nfor seven days. Individuals may leave quarantine after 7 days with a negative\ntest on day 5 or later and return to school on day 8 as long as the\nquarantined individual remains symptom-free.\n\nOn the following early release days (May 19th, May 26th, June 9th), remote\nmeal services will be consolidated to a few central locations: Baldwin,\nCambridgeport, Fletcher Maynard, Kennedy-Longfellow, and King Open. Families\nare welcome to pick up two days\u2019 worth of meals the day before each early\nrelease day at any meal pick-up site.\n\nGraham & Parks teacher Karen Engels is a 2022 [Massachusetts Teacher of the\nYear\n(TOY)](https://urldefense.com/v3/__http:/track.spe.schoolmessenger.com/f/a/k29TRUB_K0eIDGh0nJ9maQ**A/AAAAAQA*/RgRiexoUP0Q-aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZG9lLm1hc3MuZWR1L2FtYXppbmdlZHVjYXRvcnMvdG95LyNwcm9ncmFtb3ZlcnZpZXdXB3NjaG9vbG1CCmCSlOaZYLmLgjJSFGJraW1AY2FtYnJpZGdlbWEuZ292WAQAAAAB__;fn5-!!GolgDdAAPFHvrrz0!NqjIC5Yi6eKDyj4q9N_tLtz8DkwHiucvaLVy-\nZSltt1cKYRwJVlyVSZCN92BwoMRz6Y$) semi-finalist.

What percent of COVID tests in Cambridge are being genetically sequenced? How are we keeping track of new virus variants reaching Cambridge?\n\n2. It has been great to see some of the local Cambridge vaccination clinics. Can you talk more about how the City is partnering with community groups to reach Cambridge residents for whom English may not be their first language or who may feel more comfortable getting vaccinated in a specific community setting?\n\nMAYOR SIDDIQUI\n\n1. There has been a community question around the need for children to continue to be masked at local playgrounds. Can you share the current policy and rationale publicly?\n\n2. As of May 10th, the City of Cambridge announced remaining in Phase IV, Step 1 of the Commonwealth\u2019s Reopening Plan. We have received some questions around a timeline for when Cambridge may move to Phase IV Step 2 and the other anticipated re-openings based on the Baker administrations timeline, for example the State's May 29th increased gathering limits and permission for street festivals and parades or relaxing of guidance for bars, beer gardens, breweries, wineries and distilleries?\n\n",

      "full_text": " A communication transmitted from Louis A. DePasquale, City Manager, relative to Awaiting Report Item Number 21-11 regarding filling vacant positions. In response to Awaiting Report 21-11 regarding filling vacant positions,\nplease be advised of the following:  \n  \nAt the time the FY21 Operating Budget was submitted, it was intended that all\nnew positions would not be filled until at least April 2021 because of the\nfinancial uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and while the City\ncontinued to assess both immediate and long term impacts of the crisis.  \n  \nDuring conversations with the Council, it was noted that delaying the hiring\nprocess for certain vacant positions in the Police Department would result in\napproximately $2.5 million in savings. It was subsequently agreed to delay\nfilling these vacancies in the Police Department in order to begin the process\nof hiring staff for newly created positions related to key areas of affordable\nhousing, human services, equity, and early childhood, which would otherwise\nhave been intentionally kept vacant for most of the Fiscal Year.  \n  \nIn honoring this commitment, the Police Department took the following actions\nin FY21:\n\n\u00b7 Delayed the third class of the Cambridge-Northeastern Police Recruit Academy\nwith 12 potential recruits by six (6) months, resulting in approximate savings\nof $492,000.\n\n\u00b7 Did not fill approximately 16 sworn vacancies that occurred at various\npoints during the year for approximate savings of $560,000.\n\n\u00b7 Delayed the second class of the newly reinstated Police Cadet Program by one\nyear. This resulted in budget savings of approximately $600,000, which would\nhave funded approximately 15 new cadets.\n\n\u00b7 Civilian positions went unfilled for most of the fiscal year including the\nProcedural Justice Informatics Analyst position, Case Manager positions in\nProfessional Standards and Clinical Support, a Fiscal Affairs Analyst and 3\nclerical positions in the Departments records Unit. These resulted in savings\nof approximately $727,000.\n\nThese actions allowed the City to move forward with the hiring process for the\nnew prioritized positions noted in the Awaiting Report. I am pleased to share\nthat significant progress has been made in filling these new positions, and is\nnoted as follows:  \n\n  \n\n\u00b7 A new Case Manager in the Housing Liaison Office began employment in\nDecember 2020.\n\n\u00b7 A new Housing Case Manager at the Multi-Service Center is in the final\nstages of the hiring process.\n\n\u00b7 A new Associate Housing Planner began employment in January 2021 to support\nthe inclusionary rental housing program.\n\n\u00b7 A new Housing Development Project Planner was hired in April 2021 and will\nadd capacity to the preservation and development program in the Community\nDevelopment Department.\n\n\u00b7 Staff are finalizing a job posting for a new Compliance and Asset Manager\nposition, which is anticipated to be posted before the end of the fiscal year.\n\n\u00b7 A new Part-time Inclusionary Housing Assistant position was posted in fall\n2020 and reposted in February 2021. Applications received are actively being\nreviewed.\n\n\u00b7 A new Social Worker focused on the Central Square Branch Library began\nemployment in March 2021.\n\n\u00b7 New positions related to early childhood are currently posted (School\nReadiness Manager) or will be posted shortly (Outreach Worker for the African\nAmerican Community) as new leadership staff related to those positions have\nbecome more familiar with, and begin to put their teams together.\n\n\u00b7 An additional early childhood position (Parent Educator/Home Visiting\nCoordinator) will be hired this summer as all of the home visiting and most of\nthe parent education is currently being done remotely due to the pandemic.\n\n  \n\u00b7 Funding was included the FY21 Budget for leadership in Equity and Culture.\nThe position of Director of Organizational Culture has been created and will\nbe posted this fiscal year. Internal discussions are ongoing, and it is\nanticipated that in addition to providing leadership, the position will\ncoordinate and enhance the City\u2019s antiracism, equity and inclusion efforts.\n\n  \nIn general, filling vacant positions, and particularly for newly created\npositions, involves several steps before an individual is eventually hired and\nbegins employment. This might include further internal discussions among\nleadership and management staff and refining the title, role, and salary.\nThere are also logistical considerations, particularly regarding available\nphysical space as the City continues to work to mitigate the spread of\nCOVID-19. Finally, the interview and hiring process can take several weeks in\nmany cases, especially as the City strives hire the highest quality candidates\nfor any position.\n\n",

In response to Awaiting Report Item Number 21-31, regarding funding for\nhousing stabilization assistance in the Fiscal Year 2022 Budget, please be\nadvised of the following:  \n  \nI am very proud to share that the FY22 Budget reflects a strong commitment to\naffordable housing and housing stabilization which is one of the City\u2019s top\npriorities and has become even more crucial as we continue to work to support\nour most vulnerable residents that have been impacted by the COVID-19\npandemic.  \n  \nThe FY22 Budget includes $350,000 in additional funding specifically for\nhousing stabilization services related to eviction prevention including rental\nassistance, and other stabilization programming as outlined below:  \n  \nThe submitted FY22 Budget includes an additional $100,000 for rental\nassistance to support households that are at risk of losing housing. This\nfunding is in addition to $215,000 in rental assistance funding which was\nalready part of the Multi Service Center budget in the Department of Human\nService Programs.  \n  \nThe budget also includes an additional $100,000 for stabilization services,\nwhich was added to the Housing Liaison Office budget within the Executive\nDepartment. This funding will be used to supplement existing services\nadministered through non-profit partners, such as mediation and/or other\nspecialized interventions. There are also additional funds included in the\nFY22 Budget to support potential additional staff and or services in the\nHousing Liaison Office ($50,000).  \n  \nThe submitted FY22 Budget was also increased by an additional $100,000 for\nlegal services to support eviction prevention efforts through the Multi\nService Center. This funding is in addition to $286,707 which was already part\nof the Multi Service Center budget in the Department of Human Service\nPrograms. Currently, funding is divided between Greater Boston Legal Services\nand DeNovo. The additional FY22 funds will be allocated to those two\norganizations, and in coordination with the City Manager\u2019s Housing Liaison\nOffice.\n\n",

At the last meeting, Public Health advised there were 60 shots given at the vaccine clinic in North Cambridge. What has the count been at subsequent clinics May 5th-7th? Is this more or less than we anticipated? Have there been conversations about Moderna or Pfizer being a more preferred option if the counts were less than expected at the clinics?\n\n2. Can DPW/ISD give an update on restaurant patios in process and how issues are being addressed? The patio at Puritan and Co. has been delayed for several weeks, and we have heard anecdotally that several other patios are being delayed for various reasons. Given the urgency of getting these operationalized, how are we clearing hurdles for restaurants to open their patios as soon as possible?\n\nCOUNCILLOR NOLAN\n\n1. What has the city learned about new variants and how that might affect future need for booster vaccinations? \n\n2. With the pandemic changing modes of transit and community, does the city have any monitoring systems in place to help aid future planning - to help ensure up to date information for the implementation of the bike plan and potential enhancements to public transit?\n\nMAYOR SIDDIQUI\n\n1. How is CPH thinking about vaccination for 12 to 15-year olds?\n\n",

      "full_text": " A communication transmitted from Louis A. DePasquale, City Manager, relative to Awaiting Report Item Number 21-25, regarding a report on monitoring drought conditions and an update on demand projections. In response to Awaiting Report Item Number 21-25, regarding a report on\nmonitoring drought conditions and an update on demand projections, Managing\nDirector of the Water Department Sam Corda reports the following:\n\nDrought Monitoring/Reporting:\n\nThe Water Department continues to monitor drought conditions within the\nCambridge water system. The monitoring consists of: the review and tracking of\nprecipitation data (from our USGS gauging stations) versus local historic\naverage monthly precipitation; review of the National Oceanographic and\nAtmospheric Administration (NOAA)/National Weather Service (NWS) long range\n(12.5 months) precipitation predictions; review of the US Drought Monitor and\nDrought Outlook for Massachusetts, New England and the US; Review of the\nMassachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MADEP) drought status\nand current levels as defined by the Secretary of Energy and Environmental\nAffairs (EEA); review of the Cambridge \u201cRisk Based Drought Management Plan\n(2016); review of the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) water\nSupply Status (operating under normal conditions a/o April 1, 2021) of which\nwe are a full water member and follow their MADEP Approved Drought Management\nPlan.\n\nThe drought levels are updated on our webpage (please see link below) as they\nare declared by the Secretary of EEA. During the drought of 2020 we added\ninserts in the water bills about the drought status. We have restarted the\nnotice with the mid-April 2021 water billing and will continue throughout the\ndrought declaration period. We added drought status \u201ctweets\u201d to our daily\nwater conservation tweets to inform Cambridge residents. Also, we have added\nthe use of Cable TV for our drought information campaign.\n\n<https://www.cambridgema.gov/Water/administration/droughtstatusandwaterconservation/droughtstatus>\n\n  \nReservoir Monitoring:\n\nThe Reservoir System capacity is monitored weekly and tracked monthly.\nCurrently, the Hobbs Brook Reservoir, our largest reservoir, continues to be\nrecharging while we draw only from Stony Brook and Fresh Pond Reservoirs.\nOctober through May is the typical time when our water system recharges. The\nreservoir system storage is above 90% capacity and is continuing to increase.\nThe system capacity is below March 2020 but significantly above the March of\n2016 and 2017 - the first and second years of the recent major drought.\n\nThe City Manager\u2019s office is updated routinely, and the Water Board is updated\nmonthly on drought, precipitation, water consumption information and the\ncurrent Reservoir capacity status.\n\nWater Conservation:\n\nThe Water Department continues to use social media to inform Cambridge of\nwater conservation methodologies. This is in the form of daily tweets on water\nconservation tips, and updates to the Department Webpage (please see link\nbelow) monthly or more frequently as conditions/information changes.\n\n<https://www.cambridgema.gov/Water/administration/droughtstatusandwaterconservation/waterconservation>\n\nWe are adding an indoor/outdoor water conservation pamphlet into the water\nbills effective the mid-April 2021 billing - the brochures were used last fall\nas well. The insert will be used twice a year, every Spring and Fall and they\nare sent to the entire city. We reinserted a water conservation comment on the\nwater bills starting on the mid-April billing cycle.\n\nWe have just added the use of Cable TV to send out water conservation\ninformation on the cable scroll.\n\nWe will continue our water conservation efforts with Universities, large users\nand with other City Departments. This has included the installation of smart\nirrigation systems, as well as, when feasible turning them on later and\nturning them off earlier. We continually recommend the installation of low\nflow toilets (0.8/1.2 gallons/flush; energy star washing machines; aerators on\nall faucets; and refer all customers to visit the Cambridge Water Department,\nMADEP, USEPA and MWRA websites for many tips and techniques to conserve water.  \n  \nWater Demand Projections:\n\nThe Water Department is planning to update the Water Demand Projections from\n2011 that projected water demand through 2041. It is anticipated that this\neffort will take 6-12 months and will include the effects of the pandemic on\nour water demand.\n\n",

I am writing to request that the City Council authorize me to enter an\nagreement with the Town of Watertown for the purpose of performing sidewalk\nreconstruction work on a portion of Belmont Street that is located in\nWatertown. The street and the sidewalk on the north side of Belmont Street\nbetween Mount Auburn Street and Ericsson Street are fully within Cambridge,\nbut the sidewalk on the south side of that portion of Belmont Street is\nlocated within Watertown.  \n  \nBelmont Street between Mount Auburn Street and Ericsson Street is included in\nthe City\u2019s Five Year Sidewalk and Street Reconstruction Plan. The Department\nof Public Works and the Community Development Department have been working\nwith the community to develop plans for the project. The scope of work\nincludes repaving the street, installing new water main and services,\nreconstructing the sidewalks, maintaining the inbound bus priority lane and\nbike lanes, adding pedestrian crossings and raised side street crossings for\npedestrians, and providing a new connection on Holworthy Street for people\nwalking and biking to the new Watertown-Cambridge Greenway. As part of this\nproject, the sidewalk on that portion of Belmont Street that is located in\nWatertown will be reconstructed. Attached is a drawing that depicts the\nportion of the Belmont Street sidewalk located in Watertown that will be\nreconstructed as part of this project.  \n  \nThe Town of Watertown will fund the improvements in Watertown, approximately\n$383,000 of the $2,500,000 project.

The design is\ncurrently being finalized and the project is anticipated to be bid in the\nsummer of 2021, with construction beginning in the fall of 2021. This has been\na joint project between the City and the Town of Watertown.  \n  \nIn order to facilitate the City\u2019s entry onto the portion of Belmont Street\nthat is located in Watertown, the City will need to enter a \u201cjoint operations\u201d\nagreement with the Town of Watertown pursuant to G.L. c. 40, \u00a7 4A.

In-person and\nonline learning will resume as usual following April Break on Monday, April\n26th. There will be a different approach for the elementary, upper, and high\nschool levels, based on the needs of the in-person expansion for rest of the\nschool year. The staff planning days will be for infection control training\nand classroom setup in advance of the in-person dates.\n\nThe staff planning day for the high school will be on May 5th and instead of\nhaving a full PD day for elementary schools, who are already in-person five\ndays a week, there will be three new early releases on April 28, May 19, and\nMay 26 for teacher collaboration and planning.\n\nThe state is proceeding with MCAS testing this year. It is CPS\u2019s goal to make\nMCAS as minimally disruptive to students and educators to maximize daily,\nongoing commitments to rigorous, joyful, and culturally responsive teaching\nand learning across our schools. Here are some key facts about MCAS testing\nfor students in grades 3-8 this spring. Please visit [this\npage](https://www.cpsd.us/cms/One.aspx?portalId=3042869&pageId=70096417) for\nmore details.\n\n\u00b7 Federal and state law require all students in grades 3-8 to take the MCAS in\nEnglish Language Arts (ELA) and Mathematics, and students in grades 5 and 8 in\nScience, Technology, and Engineering (STE)\n\n\u00b7 There will be no negative impact to students based on their MCAS results or\na family\u2019s choice to opt-out of testing\n\n\u00b7 The state has shortened this year\u2019s MCAS tests, which are expected to take\n1-1.5 hours in math and STE and 2-2.5 hours in ELA\n\n\u00b7 This year, the state will not use MCAS participation rates or results to\npenalize schools or districts\n\n\u00b7 CPS uses a range of assessment tools to understand student progress and\nareas of need.  \n\nLast week, I added a ceremony at the King Open School where the Consul General\nof Portugal, Jo\u0101o Fin do Lago delivered a generous donation of 122 Portuguese\ntextbooks and a collection of children\u2019s reading books to the Ol\u00e1 Program.\n\nOn Thursday, April 8th, the School Committee hosted Virtual Candidate Forums\nfor the three finalists for the position of [Interim Superintendent of\nSchools](https://cpsd.tedk12.com/hire/ViewJob.aspx?JobID=3026).

At this point in the pandemic, there is extensive evidence on mask use outdoors and the risk of Covid19 transmission. Being outdoors and not in close proximity for a prolonged period is an extremely low risk activity. If Governor Baker lifts the mask mandate statewide for outdoors, will Cambridge follow suit?\n\n2. Now that anyone over 16 can get a vaccine and we are over the 50% initial dose, is there any sense that there is resistance to getting the vaccine? Any thoughts on how to ensure that all residents eligible get the vaccine?\n\nMAYOR SIDDIQUI\n\n1. CPHD staff recently met with several Cambridge restaurant owners to get feedback on strategies to help restaurants with some guidance on air quality or posters that can motivate safe dining behaviors. Improving masks used by restaurant staff and assessing air turnover and placement of HEPA filter units were discussed as positive steps. The panel suggested that these safety measures are crucial to keep restaurants open. The panel also agreed that any way to convince establishments with indoor dining to collect contact info from all parties (or individuals) will be crucial during follow up contact tracing if there are transmission clusters. What are some next steps on these discussions?\n\n",

DePasquale, City Manager, relative to the appropriation of $300,000 from Free Cash to the Public Investment Public Works Extraordinary Expenditures account to continue the COVID-19 sewer testing program through the end of calendar year 2021. I am herby requesting an appropriation of $300,000 from Free Cash to the\nPublic Investment Public Works Extraordinary Expenditures account to continue\nthe COVID-19 sewer testing program through the end of calendar year 2021. Data\nfrom the program is posted weekly at\n<https://cityofcambridge.shinyapps.io/COVID19/?tab=wastewater>  \n  \nBackground  \n  \nIn November 2020, the Cambridge Public Health Department and Cambridge\nDepartment of Public Works collaborated to establish a contract with Biobot in\norder to analyze SARS-CoV-2 (causing COVID-19) in municipal wastewater. Biobot\nhad developed a reliable viral detection method after working with MWRA at\nDeer Island since March 2020. Biobot has a larger client base that includes\nwaste treatment districts across the US and has established opioid\nsurveillance agreements with many of these entities. The PCR-based analytical\nmethod Biobot uses detect the presence and prevalence of the virus in a sample\ntaken every 30 minutes over a 24-hour period once per week. This data can\nserve as an early indicator of localized spikes and overall citywide trends in\nCOVID-19 infections in Cambridge.  \n  \nLimitations, benefits and features of the program include:\n\n\u00b7 Data reflects output from everyone who lives, works or studies in Cambridge\nwithin the 24-hour sample period, so some catchment areas (sewersheds) will be\nmore impacted by daytime use than others (e.g. sample collected at Waverly St\nis labeled \u201cCambridgeport\u201d, but also includes much of the MIT campus and some\nbusinesses and offices Central Square).\n\n\u00b7 Correspondingly, these data might not capture output in any given 24-hour\nperiod from Cambridge residents who leave home to work or study during that\nperiod.\n\n\u00b7 Over the 18 weeks of collected data we\u2019ve seen that Cambridge wastewater\ncounts are consistently lower than the comparable regional MWRA. This helps\nvalidate the measures taken by the Cambridge community, schools, businesses\nand the City administration to reduce viral transmission.\n\n\u00b7 The Expert Advisory Panel examines the results and trends from this data at\neach meeting and has observed some predictive value in the data. In a smaller\ncollection area (e.g. East Cambridge vs. all of Boston Metro North) there are\nmore noise in the data.\n\n\u00b7 We expect that early signs of a new spike in transmission, after we finally\nreach a period of low transmission, will be evident in the Cambridge data. Our\ncollection of Cambridge data since November has occurred entirely during a\ntime of elevated transmission, so we have not had an opportunity to benefit\nfrom this kind of early signal.\n\n\u00b7 By establishing a working platform for reliable collection of wastewater\nsamples from our system we can consider other public health metrics that have\nbeen developed utilizing wastewater surveillance as a real-time tool in\ncommunity health assessment. This could be an important new source of health\ndata beyond the pandemic. Future benefits include:\n\no Use of this signal as an early warning signal for upcoming surges once we\nhave settled into a low steady-state or no-detect baseline.\n\no Access to pilot surveillance projects. Biobot already agreed to include\nCambridge to their opioid surveillance program at no cost during a trial.\n\no Ready platform for participation in other biomarkers reflecting public\nhealth outcomes such as metabolic health, opioid use and type, and other\nindicators. The data has been promoted globally as a potentially valuable\nreal-time metrics to inform health intervention and promotion efforts.\n\no Participation in experimental variant surveillance efforts to detect\nemerging SARS-Cov_2 variants a high significance. Specific variants can only\nbe reliably detected with a validated method and the variants of concern may\nchange over a few weeks, so this is considered a pilot program.\n\n\u00b7 Biobot has been developing analytical methods to detect new variants. At\nthis point, Biobot is starting to screen for B117 variant (initially as\npresence/absence, soon with prevalence) and is offering to clients for the\nfirst month, until the middle of April. Once B117 dominates community cases\n(within a few weeks), there is less value to surveillance to determine its\nprevalence. Biobot has to decide where to focus their variant surveillance\nefforts (which emerging variants to seek to detect and quantify). CPHD staff\nhas communicated our interest in participating in these experimental variant\nsurveillance efforts and will consider the value of long-term commitment to\ntheir variant tracking efforts.\n\nWastewater surveillance is used in combination with case data, presence of\ntransmission within a specific business or institution, and hospitalization\nwhen make decisions about opening, closing or restricting certain activities.\nUse of wastewater data from regional source (e.g. MWRA) can be a better\nmeasure of community-wide risks, since such a high proportion of residents\nwork and study elsewhere and so many workers and students in Cambridge during\nthe day live outside the city, but the city specific data can serve as an\nearly indicator of localized spikes and overall citywide trends in COVID-19\ninfections in Cambridge.\n\n",

I voted affirmative\n(3-4) following conversations with the Superintendent and the data analysis\nthe administration presented to the School Committee, where I learned that\ndistrict-wide closures legally require secular reasons when historical data\nshow low absence rates on those days. The data on student absences on and\nsurrounding Rosh Hashanah, Diwali, and Lunar New Year showed to be below the\naverage daily student absence rates. There continue to be some questions from\nmembers around whether we can close on the second day of Rosh Hashanah and\nstart the school year earlier. We will be discussing the calendar again after\nthe Budget Workshop next Tuesday, April 13th.\n\nThe School Committee invited the community to watch the Virtual Candidate\nForums (a student panel, a staff panel, and a family/community member panel)\non Thursday, April 8th, for the three finalists of the role of Interim\nSuperintendent of Schools.

It is now more important than ever\nfor our community to remain vigilant with all of our COVID-19 safety\nprotocols. Everyone, including those who are fully vaccinated, must continue\nto wear a mask, maintain physical distance, and wash hands frequently to\nprevent COVID-19 transmission.

Can you give an update on the Metro North Vaccine Partnership now that the state is receiving more doses from the federal government and 4/19 is rapidly approaching? Will the site in Somerville, that is currently open only for CHA patients, and the other identified locations be opening soon to non-CHA patients as part of the regional partnership? \n\n2. Can you give an update on the homebound vaccine program, how many people have been signed up, how are you contacting residents who might be eligible?\n\nCOUNCILLOR NOLAN\n\n1. What is the city doing to ensure that outdoor learning spaces - including tents wherever needed or possible, including the CRLS tennis courts - are in place for students?\n\n2. What are we communicating to the residents about what types of activities and travel may be planned after vaccination? And do we have any sense of whether schools/universities at any level will be requiring vaccinations when they open this fall?\n\nMAYOR SIDDIQUI\n\n1. Is our biobot surveillance able to pick up all variants? If not, what are options for continued surveillance?\n\nCOUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER\n\n1. The most recent COVID-19 Expert Advisory Panel notes from March 24 says, \u201cCollection of contact information from [restaurant] patrons is specified in the State\u2019s minimum requirements for this sector posted as the Safety Standards and Checklist for Restaurants (March 22, 2021). According to CTC staff, collection of this information among Cambridge restaurants is not very consistent and could be improved.\u201d Could you talk more about what contact information has been missing? What can the City do to better support local restaurants in collecting contact tracing information, which is really important to control the recent surge in COVID cases? \n\n2. Since the beginning of the year, Cambridge has seen 22 eviction filings at the Avalon North Point development-which includes a number of affordable housing units through the City\u2019s inclusionary zoning ordinance-and another 23 eviction filings from other property owners. While landlords may continue to file paperwork for eviction, Cambridge\u2019s eviction moratorium remains in effect. Does the City have more information about eviction causes listed in the filings? How many are for non-payment, how many are for purported lease violations, etc.? Do we know if any of these eviction cases are aimed at tenants living in the affordable housing units?\n\nCOUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN\n\n1. There\u2019s a lot of news <https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/06/health/youth-sports-covid-spread-wellness/index.html> around the B.1.1.7 variant spreading through youth athletics and other out of school activities. As we reopen the city and make supervised sports and recreational activities available to young people, how do we ensure everyone\u2019s safety is maximally protected?\n\n",

I am hereby requesting the appropriation of $750,000.00 from Free Cash to the\nPublic Investment Fund, Department of Human Services Programs Extraordinary\nExpenditures account to provide necessary funds to implement repairs to the 3\nswimming pools located at the War Memorial Pool Facility.  \n  \nIn 2019, $75,000 was appropriated for a study to determine necessary repairs\nto the concrete and circulation system at the War Memorial Pool, including\ndesign services. The Department retained the services of CDM Smith to perform\na comprehensive assessment of the 3 pool foundations and 2 circulating\nsystems. The assessment was completed in 2020 and confirmed that the aging\npool foundations and circulating systems would be at risk of failure at\nmultiple locations if significant repairs are not made. A full design process\nhas been completed, including construction methods, materials, and drawings,\nto define the interventions necessary to keep each of the 3 pools operating\nsafely. Working with the School Department, the Department\u2019s Recreation\nDivision determined that the most appropriate and least disruptive time to do\nthe work would be during the summer of 2021.  \n  \nThe use of Free Cash to fund larger projects, such as this one, once costs\nhave been determined is part of our planned approach to fund such projects\nwhich are outside the Capital Budget Process.  \n  \nI am recommending this appropriation to ensure the long term continued\navailability of this important School and City resource. With City Council\napproval, the project will go out to bid in April and it is expected that the\nwork will be completed this summer.\n\n",

I am writing to submit the attached Zoning Petition which amends Article 8.000\nof the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance. The Law Department, along with the\nCommunity Development Department and Inspectional Services Department, have\nprepared this Petition to amend the Zoning Ordinance in order to comply with\nG.L. c.40A, \u00a76.  \n  \nA recent case from the Supreme Judicial Court (the \u201cSJC\u201d) has interpreted G.L.\nc.40A, \u00a76 to provide special protections to lawful preexisting nonconforming\nsingle and two-family dwellings. Bellalta v. Zoning Board of Appeals of\nBrookline, 481 Mass. 372 (2019). Specifically, the SJC held that if an\nalteration or addition to a lawful preexisting nonconforming single and two-\nfamily dwelling increases an existing dimensional nonconformity, but does not\ncreate any new dimensional nonconformities, the property owner is only\nrequired to obtain a special permit for the alteration or addition, and not a\nvariance. This holding is limited to lawful preexisting nonconforming single\nand two-family dwellings. This holding is also in conflict with Article 8.000\nof the Zoning Ordinance because presently in certain instances the Zoning\nOrdinance requires that a property owner obtain a variance for alterations or\nadditions to a lawful preexisting nonconforming single and two-family\ndwelling, even where no new nonconformities are created.  \n  \nAs an example, if a single or two-family dwelling is lawfully preexisting\nnonconforming because it exceeds the allowable Floor Area Ratio (\u201cFAR\u201d) and\nthe property owner has planned an addition that will further exceed the FAR\nbut not create a new nonconformity, by law the Zoning Ordinance cannot require\nthe property owner to obtain a variance to allow the addition. Rather, that\naddition requires the grant of a special permit and finding that the proposed\nadditional will not be substantially more detrimental than the existing\npreexisting nonconforming structure to the neighborhood.  \n  \nThis Petition is necessary to bring the Zoning Ordinance into conformance with\nthe SJC\u2019s interpretation of G.L. c.40A, \u00a76. The Law Department, Community\nDevelopment Department and Inspectional Services Department will be available\nto discuss this Petition with you and with the Planning Board throughout the\nzoning amendment process.\n\n",

Embodied Emissions: As a condition of receiving an occupancy permit, the\ndeveloper shall provide to CDD an accounting of the emissions generated by the\nconstruction of any Green Building Project. The Embodied Emissions shall be\ndocumented by a licensed engineer, using Passive House or other acceptable\nenergy and emissions modeling software, and include:\n\n    1. Emissions for manufacturing all building materials used, including associated raw materials extraction, production and transportation.\n\n    2. Estimates for transportation emissions caused by delivering the materials to the construction site.\n\n    3. Emissions generated on the site by heavy equipment such as cranes.\n\nb. The Embodied Emissions shall not include:\n\n    1. Emissions associated with installing renewable energy facilities on site, including but not limited to solar PV and solar hot water, air source and ground source heat pumps, and any other systems that substantially reduce the future emissions of the building.\n\n    2. Emissions generated from human labor (e.g. individual transport, small power tools, food consumption, etc.).\n\n    3. Emissions for transporting landscaping materials and plants to the site.\n\n    4. Emissions associated with installing electric vehicle charging infrastructure (EVSE).\n\nc. Expected Annual Emissions. The developer shall present an accounting of the\nexpected emissions to be generated by routine operation of the building over\nthe course of one calendar year. Emissions will be calculated as metric tons\nof CO2 equivalent using a formula approved by CDD, taking into account the\nlocal emissions profile for the grid at the time the building is first\noccupied to convert grid electrical consumption (kWH) into emissions. The\nExpected Annual Emissions shall include:\n\n    1. Emissions from any permanently installed onsite combustion such as a natural gas boiler to heat the building.\n\n    2. Emissions from grid electricity delivered to the building for operating any permanently installed equipment and lights in the building, including but not limited to HVAC systems, elevators, and light fixtures.\n\nd. The Expected Annual Emissions calculation shall not include:\n\n    1. Renewable energy systems such as solar PV systems installed prior to occupancy that net meter to the building itself. \n\n    2. Tenant plug loads and tenant installed onsite fossil fuel combustion (e.g. a natural gas appliance).\n\n    3. Backup generators.\n\n    4. Transportation emissions associated with the building operation.\n\n    5. Emissions associated with electric vehicle charging at the building.\n\ne. Lifetime Expected Emissions. The Lifetime Expected Emissions from the\nbuilding will be calculated based on a formula approved by CDD, and will\ninclude the following:\n\n    1. The expected decline of grid emissions, reaching zero no later than 2050.\n\n    2. Expected emissions reductions under the BEUDO regime.\n\n    3. Any long term contracts to directly purchase 100% renewable energy sourced from the FERC New England region (such as solar or wind generated energy, or biogas) entered into between the building operator and certified (by CDD) providers of 100% renewable energy shall be subtracted from the total. For example, if the developer has signed a contract for 10 years for the total expected grid electrical consumption to come from renewable sources, the first 10 years of grid electrical consumption shall be considered emissions free and would not contribute to the lifetime expected total emissions.\n\n    4. The formula will assume that no grid emissions will be generated by the building past 2050, and that any onsite fossil fuel equipment will also have been replaced by 2050, so that the building emissions will be modeled as a declining schedule reaching zero no later than 2050.\n\nf. Total Emissions. The Total Emissions expected to be generated by the\nbuilding will be the sum of the Embodied Emissions and the Lifetime Expected\nEmissions.\n\ng. The developer will present a payment schedule for how to zero out the Total\nEmissions of the building, using a social cost of carbon formula approved by\nCDD. The payment schedule may be annualized over a period not to exceed 10\nyears. The outstanding balance shall act as a lien on the property in case it\nis sold. Any offset must demonstrate direct benefits to low-income and\nminority communities in Cambridge, including economic opportunity through job\ncreation and or financial savings through e.g. utility bill reductions.\nAcceptable offsets must be approved by CDD, and will include:\n\n    1. No less than 25% of the mitigation funds shall be spent on green jobs development programs, including education and training, to help build capacity for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects in Cambridge. Any such program must be free of cost to participants, and successful completion of the program must lead to a certification in a specific skill such as, for example: Solar Installer, Weatherization Installer and Technician, Building Energy Analyst, Urban Forestry or Urban Agriculture. Specific criteria and certifications will be set by CDD via regulation.\n\n    2. Payment for energy efficiency upgrades to existing buildings located in the City of Cambridge.\n\n    3. Payment into the City of Cambridge Renewable Energy and Greenhouse Gas Reduction Revolving Fund for reducing emission in public projects, including affordable housing developments.\n\n    4. Payment for the installation of new solar PV systems to be located in the City of Cambridge.\n\n    5. Payment for the creation of community solar PV installations that benefit Cambridge residents by making discounted solar generated electricity available to them. Such systems need not be located in Cambridge but must be located in the Northeast Massachusetts and Boston (NEMA) load zone. \n\n    6. Payment for direct supply contracts of 100% renewable electricity from sources within the FERC ISO New England assigned to another building(s) in the City of Cambridge, including via participation in Cambridge\u2019s Community Choice Electricity (CCE) program.\n\n",

How is CPH working to ensure that unsheltered, unhoused residents are fully vaccinated? Is CPH working with the First Step Outreach van and HSHS street outreach team to administer vaccines to unhoused residents who did not receive them while in shelter?\n\n2. How are we ensuring Cambridge residents, or employees at organizations based in Cambridge, who do not have legal status feel safe making an appointment and getting vaccinated? The federal program administered through the drugstore program ask for State ID's, and in this eligibility group, a paystub/work ID is required to prove eligibility which many residents who do not have legal status cannot provide. How are we providing a) access to vaccines safely to these vulnerable residents and/or b) marketing information on which clinics do not ask for ID/paystubs to our residents without legal status?\n\nCOUNCILLOR NOLAN\n\n1. The City council unanimously passed a policy order asking the city to waive all operating fees for businesses, including licenses, weights and measures, annual fees, etc. Since other cities like Somerville waived fees, the Council asked for Cambridge to at least match that and do even more in light of our resources. All the business associations in the city supported that order and confirmed that it would be helpful. Businesses have had some financial help - the community foundation, mayor\u2019s relief, federal funding, but those do not come close to filling the gaps. Small businesses across the city are still struggling and need help. To date the city has only waived 40% of a few license fees (liquor licenses) and not waived any other fees. The total impact to date has been a loss of $800,000. The city is scheduled to get $87 million in additional unplanned for funds from the American Rescue Plan, which can be used for these purposes. What are the plans for waiving more fees?\n\n2. Cambridge continues to have relatively low number of new cases compared to the county and the state and low hospitalization and thankfully few new deaths. However, we are terrible compared to many other countries and still experiencing new cases daily. Of the new cases, do we have any sense of the origin and whether it is the new variants? We know the age is trending down, and it is primarily younger residents. Are we still doing any contact tracing and/or interview to understand how the cases are being spread? \n\nMAYOR SIDDIQUI\n\n1. Can you share with the public what we\u2019re learning about vaccines in children?\n\n2. When vaccine supply becomes available, what is the plan to reach residents in North Cambridge, where we see one of the highest COVID case rates?\n\nCOUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER\n\n1. It was great to see the announcement that Riverbend Park will be open on Saturdays and Sundays starting on April 10. Thank you to the City Manager and staff for working with DCR to make this happen. Besides outdoor-dining, what are the current plans to give residents more space on City-owned streets for the duration of the pandemic via the shared streets program or other programs? \n\n2. With all Massachusetts residents age 16+ soon being eligible to receive the vaccine starting on April 19, what is the City doing to get this information out to Cambridge residents and what should residents know about signing up for a vaccination (where to sign up, how long delays based on supply of doses may be, etc.)?\n\n",

The global health crisis has brought into clear\nfocus that people with fewer societal advantages, such as access to quality\neducation, higher-paying jobs, safe housing and neighborhoods, and quality\nmedical care, bear a disproportionate burden of disease; and  \n  \n|  \n  \nWHEREAS:\n\n|\n\nCambridge is a city with a deep commitment to social justice that values its\nracially and ethnically diverse population, and despite efforts to pursue\nequitable policies, the data indicates that continued health disparities based\non race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status persist in the City as they do\nnationally; and  \n  \n|  \n  \nWHEREAS:\n\n|\n\nIn Cambridge, the cumulative COVID-19 infection rate since the beginning of\nthe pandemic when compared to White residents is 2.5 times higher among Black\nresidents, 2.9 times higher among Latinx residents, and 8 times higher among\nresidents identifying as \u201cOther,\u201d a category that includes residents who are\nmultiracial or who reported nationality in lieu of a listed category.

DePasquale, City Manager, relative to the appropriation of $1,500,000, from Free Cash, to the Public Investment Fund Public Works Extraordinary Expenditures account, to purchase and distribute standardized trash barrels to all residential buildings in the City\u2019s trash program. To further help control the rodent population in the city, an appropriation of\n$1,500,000 from Free Cash to the Public Works Public Investment Account is\nrequested for the purpose of purchasing and distributing standardized trash\nbarrels to all residential buildings in the City\u2019s trash program.  \n  \nIn providing standardized trash receptables the City will then have in place\nCity provided trash, recycling and organics toters. Requiring the use of good\nquality, adequately sized trash receptables is an important additional tool in\nthe City\u2019s continuing effort to reduce the rat population. Additionally, the\nprovision of such will then allow residents further divert recyclable\nmaterials from trash and move the city further along in its Zero Waste goals.  \n  \nBased on recommendations in the city\u2019s Zero Waste Master plan, adding\nstandardized trash receptacles to our program will provide the following\nbenefits to both employees and residents:\n\n\u00b7 Reduces potential for Rodents.\n\n\u00b7 Increases worker safety as containers can be emptied with semi-automated\ncollection compared to manual collection.\n\n\u00b7 Has potential for decreased workers compensation claims with better\nergonomics and reduced lifting of containers/bags.\n\n\u00b7 Increases collection efficiency with a reduced number of containers.\n\n\u00b7 Increases diversion from trash to recycling and organics.\n\n\u00b7 Improves aesthetics of sidewalks with fewer containers at the curb and with\na smaller footprint,\n\n\u00b7 Reduces trash spillage\n\nSimilar to the roll out of single stream recycling toters, residents will be\ngiven a receptacle(s) based on the size of their property. Understanding the\nlimited space that properties in densely populated sections of the city have,\nevery effort will be made to provide receptacles that have enough capacity\nwhile minimizing their footprint. The program will also be flexible enough to\nprovide smaller or larger receptacles to residents who request different\nsizes. The intention at this time is not to limit the size toter given to\nresidents but rather to work with residents to ensure that the toter(s) they\nare given are large enough to avoid overflow situations and small enough to\nensure that they can properly accommodate them at their homes. The picture\nbelow illustrates the various sizes we expect to offer residents.\n\n![](/Citizens/GetImage.aspx?Type=25&ID=/Aspose.Words.e0a40571-617e-42b1-b3c0-4fbe6d2b7f76.001.png)\n\nAt this time, given the disruption associated with COVID it may take longer\nthan expected to procure and distribute these receptacles. Based on a\nconservative schedule, we estimate that these materials will be distributed to\nresidential buildings in the city by the spring of 2022.\n\n",

DePasquale, City Manager, relative to the appropriation of $335,000 from Free Cash to the Public Investment Fund Public Works Extraordinary Expenditures account, to purchase and install Big Belly solar compactors on Cambridge Street between Inman Square and Lechmere Station. I am herby requesting an appropriation of $335,000 from Free Cash to the\nPublic Investment Fund Public Works Extraordinary Expenditures account, to\npurchase and install Big Belly solar compactors on Cambridge Street between\nInman Square and Lechmere Station.  \n  \nFunds will provide for 40 new compactors along Cambridge Street which will\nreplace the existing Victor Stanley barrels in the area. This investment will\nsignificantly improve the overall appearance of the commercial district,\nreduce rodent activity along the street, and improve the collection efficiency\nin this neighborhood.  \n  \nBig Belly compactors transform public litter collection into an efficient,\nclean and well managed operation. These dual-purpose receptacles: one side is\na solar-powered trash compactor and the other is a single-stream recycling\nreceptacle will increase the capacity of litter bins on Cambridge Street and\nwill quadruple the number of recycling receptacles in the area. The latest Big\nBelly receptacles are of a heavier gauge material and can be opened by floor\npeddle as well as by a chute handle. Because these bins compact trash and thus\nhave approximately 5 times the capacity of regular trash bins, they need to be\nemptied less frequently than traditional trash bins. They also transmit data\nabout fullness levels, notifying staff when specific bins need to be emptied.\nThis enables a \u201cbefore full\u201d service by City staff and vehicles, thus reducing\noperating costs for collection as more such bins are installed across the city\nover time.  \n  \nFinally, given the solid nature of these facilities they have been shown to\ndeter rodent activity in the areas they have been deployed in. The\ninstallation of these facilities further amplifies the City\u2019s commitment to\nworking with the community in addressing this public health issue.\n\n",

I am writing to request that you approve the submission of a Home Rule\nPetition that (1) would authorize the City of Cambridge (\u201cCity\u201d) to relocate\nland protected by Article 97 of the Massachusetts Constitution (\u201cArticle 97\u201d)\nat the Father Callanan Playground and Fields in Cambridge (\u201cCallanan Field\u201d)\nthat are adjacent to the Tobin Montessori and Vassal Lane Upper Schools (the\n\u201cSite\u201d), and (2) would authorize the City to construct subsurface geothermal\nwells under a portion of the Callanan Field.  \n  \nSpecifically, relief is required from the Legislature to complete the Tobin\nMontessori and Vassal Lane Upper Schools Project (\u201cProject\u201d). As background,\nthe current school building has equipment and finishes which are well past\ntheir useful life, and with the expected increase in student population, the\nbuilding is in dire need of renovation and replacement. The Project envisions\na new building which will provide for better stormwater management and which\nwill contemplate a goal of zero on site greenhouse gas emissions. The Project\nwill include low flow plumbing fixtures, heat pumps, a high-performance\nbuilding envelop, geothermal wells, energy recovery systems, on site renewable\nenergy, expanded use of natural light, as well as other sustainability\nfeatures.  \n  \nThe Callanan Field contains open space protected by Article 97. Land that is\nheld and dedicated for parkland uses pursuant to Article 97 (\u201cPark Land\u201d) may\nonly be re-used for another use with the consent of two thirds of both houses\nof the Legislature. Article 97 provides in relevant part that: \u201cthe people\nshall have the right to clean air and water, freedom from excessive and\nunnecessary noise, and the natural, scenic, historic, and esthetic qualities\nof their environment.\u201d \u201cLands and easements taken or acquired for such\npurposes shall not be used for other purposes or otherwise disposed of except\nby laws enacted by a two-thirds vote, taken by yeas and nays, of each branch\nof the general court.\u201d  \n  \nIn order to complete the Project, some of the Park Land must be removed from\nArticle 97 protection and utilized for school use. City staff have met with\nstaff of the Commonwealth\u2019s Executive Office of Energy and Environmental\nAffairs (\u201cEOEA\u201d) about the Article 97 issues associated with the Project. The\nCity indicated to EOEA staff that it proposes to replace the Park Land that\nneeds to be removed with about 40% more dedicated land than what it proposes\nto remove. EOEA staff indicated their support for the City\u2019s proposal with\nregard to the Project and more specifically, the City\u2019s proposed Article 97\nPark Land replacement plan.  \n  \nAs shown in the plan attached hereto as Attachment A, the existing site\nconditions contain about 193,540 square feet of Park Land, shown in green. The\nproposed new site conditions propose the removal of about 10,640 square feet\nof Park Land (shown in gray on Attachment B), and replacement with about 40%\nmore designated Park Land than is being removed, for a total of about 14,500\nsquare feet of newly designated Park Land (shown in blue on Attachment B),\nbringing the total designated Park Land at Callanan Field to about 197,700\nsquare feet. Attachment C shows the proposed total designated Park Land, which\nwill be in a contiguous parcel and will include numerous new park amenities,\nincluding newly renovated playgrounds, various new park features, rain gardens\nand trees, and a redeveloped recreational use path. The boundaries established\nin the attachments define the limits, more or less, of the building footprint\nand its relationship to the dedicated open space. This space only establishes\nthe parameters of the community space and is not fully designed. Once approval\nis given the design team will meet will all stakeholders(Community, City &\nSchool) in subsequent meetings to finalize the design package. As noted above,\nEOEA staff have indicated support for the City\u2019s proposal with regard to this\nProject and the City\u2019s Article 97 plan.  \n  \nRelief is also required from the Legislature to construct deep subsurface\ngeothermal wells under the Park Land, which are an important part of the\nProject\u2019s sustainability features. The proposed approximate location of the\ngeothermal wells is depicted on Attachment C, shown in green with hatching.\nAll existing public park and open space uses that are currently conducted in\nthat part of the Callanan Field will continue to be conducted after the\ninstallation of the deep subsurface geothermal wells, which will have no\neffect upon the usability of the Park Land.  \n  \nIn order to proceed with the Project, which will provide a more usable and\ncomfortable school building, advance the City\u2019s sustainability goals, and\nincrease and improve the City\u2019s designated Article 97 protected land, I ask\nthat the City Council vote in favor of filing the attached Home Rule Petition.\n\n",

I am writing to submit the attached Zoning Petition which amends Article 8.000\nof the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance. The Law Department, along with the\nCommunity Development Department and Inspectional Services Department, have\nprepared this Petition to amend the Zoning Ordinance in order to comply with\nG.L. c.40A, \u00a76.  \n  \nA recent case from the Supreme Judicial Court (the \u201cSJC\u201d) has interpreted G.L.\nc.40A, \u00a76 to provide special protections to lawful preexisting nonconforming\nsingle and two-family dwellings. Bellalta v. Zoning Board of Appeals of\nBrookline, 481 Mass. 372 (2019). Specifically, the SJC held that if an\nalteration or addition to a lawful preexisting nonconforming single and two-\nfamily dwelling increases an existing dimensional nonconformity, but does not\ncreate any new dimensional nonconformities, the property owner is only\nrequired to obtain a special permit for the alteration or addition, and not a\nvariance. This holding is limited to lawful preexisting nonconforming single\nand two-family dwellings. This holding is also in conflict with Article 8.000\nof the Zoning Ordinance because presently in certain instances the Zoning\nOrdinance requires that a property owner obtain a variance for alterations or\nadditions to a lawful preexisting nonconforming single and two-family\ndwelling, even where no new nonconformities are created.  \n  \nAs an example, if a single or two-family dwelling is lawfully preexisting\nnonconforming because it exceeds the allowable Floor Area Ratio (\u201cFAR\u201d) and\nthe property owner has planned an addition that will further exceed the FAR\nbut not create a new nonconformity, by law the Zoning Ordinance cannot require\nthe property owner to obtain a variance to allow the addition. Rather, that\naddition requires the grant of a special permit and finding that the proposed\nadditional will not be substantially more detrimental than the existing\npreexisting nonconforming structure to the neighborhood.  \n  \nThis Petition is necessary to bring the Zoning Ordinance into conformance with\nthe SJC\u2019s interpretation of G.L. c.40A, \u00a76. The Law Department, Community\nDevelopment Department and Inspectional Services Department will be available\nto discuss this Petition with you and with the Planning Board throughout the\nzoning amendment process.\n\n",

The two drafts will then be provided to the\nMayor and City Manager for review. All feedback from the Mayor and City\nManager will then be complied into the final versions of the memoranda. The\nCollins Center (at the request of the City Manager or Council) will present\nthe final memoranda, as well as answer any questions at a regular meeting of\nthe City Council.\n\n",

Parents are wondering what the DHSP plans are for a \"Spring on the Fields\" program as well as plans for IN PERSON summer camps and programming. Will DHSP be offering an outdoor afterschool activity program like they did in the Fall and if/when will they be announcing in-person summer programming plans. \n\n2. Can you please provide an update on when the Cambridge public libraries will be open for browsing. The libraries have been closed for over a year for in-person browsing, and bookstores have remained open safely with state mandated capacity limits. This has created an inequity in who in our community can access new reading materials. As we continue to move toward an opening of other departments to the public, a plan with an opening date needs to be announced for this critical resource for our residents, especially our youngest readers.\n\nCOUNCILLOR NOLAN\n\n1. What is the current thinking on extending outdoor places in our streets and how will we include the community in discussions of whether the current parking spots and sidewalks being used will continue throughout the pandemic and beyond.\n\n2. What do we know about a schedule for summer programs for all city sponsored programs, for adults and youth and children?\n\nMAYOR SIDDIQUI:\n\n1. The federal government recently announced that they released vaccine equity funding to increase trust, vaccine acceptance and administration for the 20 equity municipalities- how is CPHD referencing these strategies for our continued local efforts for vaccine equity (even if we aren\u2019t among those 20 municipalities)?\n\n2. After Cambridge Court Apartments, what is the next building to receive on-site vaccination? 808-812 Memorial Drive, 402 Rindge have a number of CHA voucher households with elderly residents.\n\nCOUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER\n\n1. Now that the Metro North Regional Vaccine Partnership sites have been announced in Somerville, what is the City doing to publicize the launch dates to Cambridge residents and ensure that residents can access the appointments?\n\nCOUNCILLOR TOOMEY:\n\n1. Have Cambridge residents outwardly expressed specific concerns or hesitations around any of the available COVID-19 vaccines?\n\nCOUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN\n\n1. Many scholars living in the Port, including in public housing buildings like Washington Elms and Newtowne Court, have relied on the 68 bus to get to CRLS each morning. The MBTA recently cut the 68 route as part of its \u201cForging Ahead\u201d service cuts. How has the city worked with the MBTA to ensure impacted scholars can still get to school on time? Has there been any direct communication between the city and the impacted scholars? While the MBTA has made some accommodations in the afternoon, has the city asked them to run a single route of the 68 bus in the morning so that those scholars can easily make it to CRLS?\n\n2. 120 residents currently relying on the CASCAP Representative Payee program to obtain their social security benefits each month will lose access to their money when the program ends at the end of April 2021. Just 20 of those residents will be able to access the same services through BayCove. The $800-$900 that folks have been collecting each month from Social Security has been a lifeline during this historic pandemic, so it is important that we prevent a coverage gap. However, it can take up to six weeks to change somebody\u2019s Representative Payee, and that\u2019s assuming an alternative provider is even available. Time is running out. What is the city\u2019s plan to ensure homeless residents in Cambridge do not lose access to their Social Security benefits when they are already strained by the COVID-19 pandemic?\n\n3. On March 18, 2021, Governor Baker announced that Massachusetts will reopen to Phase IV, Step 1. This means, among other things, that large capacity sports and entertainment venues will be permitted to operate at 12% capacity, gathering limits for event venues and in public settings will increase to 100 people indoors and 150 people outdoors, and that dance floors will be permitted at weddings and other events. This level of re-opening conflicts directly with the advice from national experts, as well as our own Expert Advisory Panel, and puts our community at grave risk of a COVID resurgence given the presence of new rapidly spreading variants, reduced testing capacity, and the nascent stage of the vaccine rollout. Will Cambridge re-open to Phase IV, Step 1 on Monday, and if so, what venues would be allowed to open in Cambridge that aren\u2019t currently operating, and at what capacity? How will we protect our most vulnerable residents who continue to bear the brunt of this pandemic, including our low-income and Black and Brown communities?\n\n",

The Planning Board may grant a Quadrangle\nNorthwest Master Plan Special Permit, incorporating any approved special\npermits for the Development Parcel, subject to the following provisions:\n\n(a) Criteria. In addition to the general special permit criteria set forth in\nSection 10.43, the Project Review Special Permit criteria set forth in Section\n19.25, and all other criteria applicable to the special permits being sought,\nthe Planning Board shall find that the following criteria are met when\ngranting a Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Special Permit:\n\n(1) The Master Plan is in substantial conformance with the vision, goals, and\nrecommendations set forth in the Alewife District Plan, including any\namendments to the Alewife District Plan or future City planning reports that\naddress the Alewife District, including but not limited to the topics of land\nuse, open space, urban form, mobility, climate and environment, housing,\neconomy, and zoning, and with any urban design guidelines published by the\nCity pursuant to the Alewife District Plan or any amendments thereto or future\nplanning reports that address the Alewife District;\n\n(2) The Master Plan is in substantial conformance with applicable standards\nfor flood and heat resilience recommended through the City\u2019s Climate Change\nPreparedness and Resilience planning efforts or future climate change planning\nefforts; and\n\n(3) The Master Plan will result in the completion of a publicly accessible\nconnection for bicyclists and pedestrians, at a minimum, across the railroad\nright of way between the Triangle District and the Quadrangle Northwest\nDistrict, with conditions incorporated into the project phasing that will\nensure its completion. A connection that accommodates passenger shuttles is\ndesirable.\n\n(4) Housing - The revised zoning requires that a development proposal must be\nin general conformance with the Alewife District Plan, which would include\nland use. The Alewife District Plan calls for residential use west of the\nextension of Spinelli Place, which is about 40-50% of the anticipated\ndevelopment area. If desired, the Council could add provisions in the\n\u201cCriteria for Approval\u201d section such as a minimum amount or percentage of\nresidential use, and/or requirements for phasing. An approach used in past\nmixed-use developments has been to require the residential phase to commence\nbefore 60% of permitted commercial uses are built, and to complete the\nresidential phase before or concurrently with the completion of commercial\nuses. Within these constraints, a timing and phasing plan for the development\nwould be subject to review and approval by the Planning Board.\n\n(5) Parking - This is also part of the required conformance with the Alewife\nDistrict Plan as included in the revised text. As in other areas of\nredevelopment, the Alewife District Plan anticipates that parking would be\nused flexibly to serve uses throughout the area at different times while\nminimizing the number of parking spaces provided. Minimum parking ratios by\nuse would be eliminated except for a smaller minimum for housing to mitigate\npossible impacts on public street parking, and maximum parking ratios by use\nwould be established as follows:\n\na. Retail: maximum 1.5 per 1,000 SF\n\nb. Office: maximum 1.1 per 1,000 SF\n\nc. R&D: maximum 0.8 per 1,000 SF\n\nd. Industrial: maximum 0.5 per 1,000 SF\n\ne. Residential: maximum 0.75 per dwelling unit, minimum .25 per dwelling unit\n\n(b) Conditions. The Quadrangle Northwest District Master Plan Special Permit\nshall set forth conditions to ensure that the applicable criteria are met,\nincluding but not limited to the following conditions:\n\n(1) Approved land uses and dimensional characteristics of the Master Plan at\nan aggregate level and for individual building sites;\n\n(2) Required public improvements and other benefits such as infrastructure and\nopen space;\n\n(3) Required measures to mitigate development impacts, including but not\nlimited to transportation impacts and construction activity;\n\n(4) Procedures for review and approval of the designs of individual buildings,\nopen spaces, public improvements, and other components of the Master Plan; and\n\n(5) Timing and phasing for completion of the different components of the\nMaster Plan, including but not limited to required public improvements,\nbenefits, and mitigation.\n\n(c) Commencement. The commencement of construction of any single building\napproved in a Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Special Permit shall constitute\nexercise of the special permit for purposes of M.G.L. Chapter 40A and Section\n10.46 of this Zoning Ordinance. The timing of completion shall be set forth by\nthe Planning Board in the conditions of the special permit, which timing may\nbe extended by the Planning Board upon a showing of good cause, and shall be\nsubject to other conditions related to timing and phasing set forth in the\nspecial permit conditions.\n\n(d) Amendments. A Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Special Permit may identify\nspecific modifications to the Master Plan that may be subject to future\napproval by a written determination of the Planning Board. Otherwise, the\nPlanning Board shall determine whether a proposed modification is a Major\nAmendment or Minor Amendment according to the standards set forth in Sections\n12.37.1 through 12.37.3 of this Zoning Ordinance.\n\n20.930.4 Modifications to Standards. Except as otherwise set forth herein, any\nproject receiving a Quadrangle Northwest District Master Plan Special Permit\nshall comply with all other applicable development standards set forth in this\nZoning Ordinance. The following modifications may be authorized by the\nPlanning Board upon granting a Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Special\nPermit:\n\n(1) The Additional FAR provisions of Paragraph (1) of Section 20.95.11 of this\nZoning Ordinance may be applied to a Quadrangle Northwest Development Parcel\nin its entirety if the proposed development incorporates construction of a\npublicly accessible pedestrian and bicycle bridge connection across the\nrailroad right of way between the Quadrangle Northwest District and the\nTriangle District or incorporation of structural elements into a building's\ndesign that includes or would permit future construction of such a pedestrian\nconnection (that are acceptable to the City for that purpose), as well as the\nconveyance (in a form acceptable to the City) of the necessary fee or easement\nproperty interests in land that would permit access to such a connection, in a\nmanner and to an extent determined to be sufficient to significantly advance\nthe objectives of the Alewife District Plan .\n\n(2) The height of any building, regardless of use, may be increased to a\nmaximum of eighty-five (85) feet, but shall remain subject to the limitations\nof Section 20.95.2, Paragraph 1(a) within 100 feet or 200 feet of a\nresidential or Open Space district, provided the Planning Board finds that the\nentire leasable ground story of any non-residential building (excluding\nentrances/exits, lobbies, circulation, utilities, loading, and other functions\nnecessary to serve upper-story uses or the building as a whole) is planned,\ndesigned, and constructed for the occupancy of light industrial uses and/or\nbusinesses that require light industrial space but also include a consumer-\nfacing or community-focused component as described in the Economy\nRecommendations of the Alewife District Plan, with floor-to-ceiling heights\nthat the Board finds to be suitable for such uses. The Planning Board may\napprove a limited number of Retail and Consumer Service Establishments to\nprovide neighborhood amenities if they do not collectively occupy more than\ntwenty percent (20%) of any building\u2019s total Ground Story and the Board finds\nthat they do not detract from the emphasis on light industrial spaces as\ndescribed in the Alewife District Plan. A residential building, which may\ninclude above-grade structured parking that is located to the rear of and\nvisually screened from the street by principal-use residential space, may also\nbe increased to a maximum of eight-five (85) feet without being required to\nmeet the other requirements of this Paragraph.\n\n(3) If the Planning Board finds that the ground story of any building requires\nelevation above the existing mean grade in order to conform to flood\nresilience standards as established by the City, then the maximum height of\nany building may be further increased by not more than four (4) feet or the\ndifference between the ground story finished floor elevation and the existing\nmean grade, whichever is lesser. To make such finding, the Planning Board\nshall have received and reviewed a written report from the City Engineer\ndescribing flood resilience standards applicable and the impact of those\nstandards to the development site.\n\n(4) Spaces within the ground story of any non-residential building that are\nreserved for light industrial uses or businesses that require light industrial\nspace but also include a consumer-facing or community-focused component as\ndescribed in the Economy Recommendations of the Alewife District Plan may be\nexcluded from the calculation of Gross Floor Area for the purpose of applying\nthe limitations and requirements of this Zoning Ordinance, provided that the\ndimensions of such spaces, their permitted range of approved uses, and other\nconditions to ensure that the intent of the Alewife District Plan is met shall\nbe set forth in writing by the Planning Board in the Quadrangle Northwest\nMaster Plan Special Permit.\n\n(5) Applicable minimum parking requirements shall be waived, and the Planning\nBoard shall set forth maximum limitations and other conditions pertaining to\nthe development and operation of off-street parking facilities in accordance\nwith the Mobility Recommendations of the Alewife District Plan.\n\n(6) Applicable yard requirements and limitations, with the exception of\nrequirements for yards abutting a residential or Open Space district as set\nforth in Paragraph (2) of Section 20.95.31 of this Zoning Ordinance, shall be\nmodified to the extent necessary to conform to the recommended building\nsetbacks and street sections recommended in the Urban Form and Mobility\nRecommendations of the Alewife District Plan, as approved by the Planning\nBoard.\n\n",

Some city staff have been working throughout the pandemic, and some have had some additional work, and some have had curtailed work due to office restrictions and quarantines. Now that the City and Commonwealth are able to see the light at the end of the tunnel, what can we expect for restoration of city services? As an example, the City extended resident parking permits, but the delay hasn\u2019t been explained. Some paid for permits 8 weeks ago and have yet to receive them - hopefully that will be resolved soon. What city services have a backlog and when can we expect operations to be relatively normal? \n\n2. As people return to work, and more commuting, we need people to feel safe using public transit, since the pandemic has led to increased single occupancy vehicle trips, which is detrimental from a number of perspectives. How is the city communicating with the MBTA about the best way to handle the migration of folks back to work? Besides requiring masks, have they been working to gear up their schedules to have more frequent service to avoid crowding? Will they use their T ambassadors to help ensure mask wearing and distancing? Will local companies do anything focused on safe, distanced transportation once they start calling folks back into the office? \n\nMAYOR SIDDIQUI:\n\n1. What is the status of CPH reaching homebound individuals with vaccines?\n\n2. As more vaccine supply becomes available with the hope that local municipalities regain more access, how and where would CPH host community vaccination sites?\n\nCOUNCILLOR TOOMEY:\n\n1. With recent approval and increased production of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine, when will we start to see it available in the Cambridge community, and is the lower efficacy rate a concern?\n\n",

      "full_text": " The City Manager be and hereby is requested to confer with the City of Cambridge Law Department to review the above changes to the language of the Domestic Partnerships Ordinance and report back to the Council.  PASSED TO A SECOND READING IN COUNCIL JULY 27, 2020.  TO BE ORDAINED ON OR AFTER SEPTEMBER 14, 2020 ORDERED: That section 2.119 of the Ordinances of the City of Cambridge, titled\nDomestic Partnerships be amended to read as follows:\n\nChapter 2.119 - DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIPS\n\n  \n\n2.119.010 - Recognition and scope.\n\nA. The City Council recognizes the diverse composition of its citizenry and\nvalues its people. The City Council acknowledges that the people's lives have\nevolved from when laws governing family relationships were enacted.\nPerpetuation of the traditional definitions of \"family\" excludes a significant\nsegment of the Cambridge population, deprives them of recognition and\nvalidation, and denies certain rights that should be afforded to persons who\nshare their homes, their hearts and their lives. The City, recognizing its\ncommitment to nondiscrimination and fair treatment of its citizens and\nemployees, adopts this chapter acknowledging domestic partnerships.\n\nB. The chapter allows persons in committed relationships who meet the criteria\nestablished by the City as constituting domestic partnerships to register at\nthe office of the City Clerk and obtain a certificate attesting to their\nstatus. The chapter recognizes certain right of access for domestic partners.\nThis chapter, in conformance with the Human Rights Ordinance, which bars\ndiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, marital status and family\nstatus, also equalizes the treatment of City employees.\n\n  \n\n2.119.020 - Definitions.\n\nAs used in this chapter:\n\nA. \"Competent to contract\" means eighteen years of age or older, and mentally\ncompetent to contract.\n\nB. \"Dependent\" means a minor who lives within the household of a domestic\npartnership and is:\n\n1. A biological child or adopted child, or foster child of a domestic partner, if the child is not provided with medical insurance coverage by the Commonwealth; \n\n2. A dependent as defined under IRS regulations; or \n\n3. A ward of a domestic partner as determined in a guardianship proceeding. \n\nC. \"Domestic partner\" means a person who meets the criteria set out in\nsubsection D of this section or who is registered as such in another\njurisdiction.\n\nD. \"Domestic partnership\" means the entity formed by two or more persons who\nmeet the following criteria and jointly file a registration statement\nproclaiming that:\n\n1. They are in a relationship of mutual support, caring and commitment and intend to remain in such a relationship; and \n\n2. They are not related by blood closer than would bar marriage in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts; and \n\n3. They are competent to contract; and \n\n4. They consider themselves to be a family. \n\nE. \"Mutual support\" means that the domestic partners each contributed in some\nfashion, not necessarily equally or financially, to the maintenance and\nsupport of the domestic partnership.\n\n(Ord. 1144 (part), 1992)\n\n  \n\n2.119.030 - Registration and withdrawal.\n\nA. Persons who meet the criteria set out in subsection D of Section 2.119.020\nmay make an official record of their domestic partnership by filing a domestic\npartnership registration form with the City Clerk. The domestic partnership\nregistration shall include the name and date of birth of each of the domestic\npartners, and the name and dates of birth of any dependents of the domestic\npartnership, and shall be signed, under the pains and penalties of perjury, by\nall domestic partners.\n\nB. Domestic partners may amend the domestic partnership registration to add or\ndelete domestic partners or dependents. Amendments to the domestic partnership\nregistration shall be signed, under the pains and penalties of perjury, by all\ndomestic partners.\n\nC. If any member of the domestic partnership is married or in another domestic\npartnership, notice of the registration of this domestic partnership and/or of\nthe addition of new partner(s) to this domestic partnership must be given, by\ncertified mail, to any marital or domestic partners outside of this domestic\npartnership.\n\nD. Any person in a domestic partnership may voluntarily withdraw from the\ndomestic partnership by filing a withdrawal statement.\n\n1. Any person in a domestic partnership may voluntarily withdraw from the domestic partnership by filing with the City Clerk, by hand or by certified mail, a withdrawal statement. The person filing the withdrawal statement must declare under pains and penalties of perjury that they are withdrawing from the domestic partnership and that a copy of the withdrawal statement has been mailed by certified mail to the other domestic partners at his, her or their last known addresses. The person filing the withdrawal statement must include on such statement the address(es) to which the copy(ies) were/was mailed. The fee for a domestic partnership withdrawal shall be $5.00. \n\n2. The death of a domestic partner functions as an automatic withdrawal from the domestic partnership as to that partner.\n\nE. If there are only two persons in the domestic partnership, withdrawal of\none person terminates the domestic partnership. If there are more than two\npersons in the domestic partnership, withdrawal of one partner does not\nterminate the domestic partnership as to the remaining persons in the domestic\npartnership. The voluntary withdrawal from a domestic partnership by a partner\nshall be effective seven days after the receipt of a withdrawal statement by\nthe City Clerk. Prior to becoming effective, the person who filed the\nwithdrawal statement may retract the withdrawal statement as follows: in\nperson at the office of the City Clerk; or via certified mail addressed to the\nCity Clerk, provided the retraction is received no later than seven days\nfollowing the date the withdrawal statement was filed. If the withdrawal\nstatement is retracted, the domestic partner shall give notice of the\nretraction, by certified mail, to the other domestic partner(s). The\nwithdrawal of a deceased person from a domestic partnership shall be effective\nimmediately upon the death of that domestic partner.\n\nF. If a domestic partnership is terminated by the death of a domestic partner,\nthere shall be no required waiting period prior to filing another domestic\npartnership. If a person voluntarily withdraws from a domestic partnership,\nthat person may not file another domestic partnership until ninety (90) days\nhave elapsed from the effective date of such withdrawal.\n\n  \n\n2.119.040 - City Clerk\u2014Fees.\n\nA. The City Clerk shall collect a reasonable fee for filing a domestic\npartnership registration. The initial amount for this fee shall be fifteen\ndollars and it shall be adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with the\nfee for an application for a marriage license.\n\nB. The City Clerk shall collect the same fee charged for marriage certificates\nfor certified copies of domestic partnership documents, other than the copy of\nthe certificate of domestic partnership issued by the City Clerk to the\ndomestic partners, as provided for in Section 2.119.050.\n\n2.119.050 - City Clerk\u2014Records.\n\nA. Upon receipt of a domestic partnership registration and filing fee, the\nCity Clerk shall issue a certificate of domestic partnership and shall mail to\neach of the domestic partners one certified copy of the certificate and one\nwallet-sized card indicating the existence of the domestic partnership, the\nnames of the domestic partners and the names of the dependents of the domestic\npartnership, if any.\n\nB. The City Clerk shall maintain records of domestic partnerships registered\nin the City, including forms filed and certificates issued. The City Clerk\nshall provide forms to persons requesting them in accordance with Section\n2.119.120.\n\nC. The City Clerk shall allow public access to domestic partnership records to\nthe same extent and in the same manner as marriage licenses.\n\n  \n\n2.119.060 - Rights of domestic partners.\n\nPersons who have registered their domestic partnership at the office of the\nCity Clerk pursuant to Section 2.119.030 are entitled to the following rights:\n\nA.\n\n1. A domestic partner shall have the same visitation rights as a spouse or parent of a patient at the Cambridge City Hospital and all other health care facilities in the City.

The school shall afford such person access as directed by the child's parent. \n\n2.

The state\u2019s Command Center will also identify specific\ndays designated for educators and school staff. Governor Baker has emphasized\nthat appointment availability will be dependent on the federally-provided\nsupply of vaccines, which are currently limited.\n\nPresident Biden also announced that all states must prioritize all educators,\nschool staff, and childcare workers to receive their first dose of a COVID-19\nvaccine by the end of March. To help states with this effort, a federal\npharmacy program will prioritize the vaccination of all school staff and\nchildcare workers during the month of March.\n\nCPS will work closely with the Cambridge Public Health Department (CPHD,\nCambridge Education Association (CEA), and other unions serving CPS employees\nto provide staff with information about vaccine distribution and appointments.\n\nOn Monday, March 1st, the job posting for the Interim Superintendent position\nof the Cambridge Public Schools went live. I will keep everyone updated on the\nprogress of our search.\n\nAlso on March 1st, we began our [expansion of in-person\nlearning](https://www.cpsd.us/cms/One.aspx?portalId=3042869&pageId=69802566).\nMy School Committee colleagues and I have been welcoming cohorts in the\nmornings outside school buildings as families returned. On March 1st,\nSuperintendent Salim and I greeted King Open and CSUS families and on March\n4th, we said hello to the families outside the Cambridgeport and Amigos\nschools. It has been such a joy to see the smiles on the faces of our\nscholars, who are so excited to be back.\n\nA few of our schools currently have waitlists for in-person learning:\n\n\u25cf Amigos: 6 students at grade 4 and 3 students at grade 8\n\n\u25cf Baldwin: 7 students at grade 2\n\n\u25cf King Open: 2 students at grades 4 and 5\n\n\u25cf Haggerty: 1 student at K\n\nBased on actual in-person enrollment in the first week, additional students\nmay be accommodated. In addition, the hardship request process has been opened\nto families.\n\nAs you all know, we are offering free COVID testing to all in-person students,\nteachers, and staff. We kicked off our student surveillance testing with\nhundreds of students participating and have launched an initial pilot of the\nstate\u2019s pooled COVID testing program for elementary school students.

Given the varying dynamics at\ndifferent grade bands, the CPHD and CPS will implement the following\nquarantine protocols if a staff or student in a classroom tests positive for\nthe virus:\n\n\u25cf Grades PK-5: the entire classroom will be closed for 10 days and the staff\nand students will be directed to quarantine\n\n\u25cf Grades 6-8 and 9-12: CPHD will work with CPS to examine the individual\nsituation in more detail to determine what level of quarantining will be\nrequired\n\nMy Office has launched a creative art contest in honor of Women\u2019s History\nMonth for students in grades 6-8.

Based on the Governor's announcement this week moving school-based staff into eligibility, what is our local plan to vaccinate our school-based staff here in Cambridge? The State vaccination website is impossible to navigate, and CVS is fully booked each day. CPSD welcomed 4-12th graders back into the classroom this week, and it's important to get this done quickly and in a coordinated fashion to both provide a level of safety for our staff, as well as instill confidence for families that school is safe to return to. \n\nCOUNCILLOR NOLAN:\n\n1. Do we have a sense of how the increased capacity for businesses and movement to Phase 3 step 2 has gone? And in line with that question, what has our capacity been to monitor for compliance with mask mandates and provide support for entities that need help opening, re-opening, or expanding while following all the continued regulations about safe operations?\n\n2. With increased vaccine eligibility and ever-changing availability of supply, there has been a lot of concern from residents about accessing an appointment for vaccination. What has been done, and what can the city do to communicate in a timely manner how and when residents can sign up for vaccines? Do we know which of the methods of communication the city uses are the most effective, and are there other methods other cities are using that we might emulate?\n\nMAYOR SIDDIQUI:\n\n1. Can CPH share any more updated race/ethnicity data of who has been vaccinated?\n\nCOUNCILLOR SIMMONS:\n\n1. When the Senior Center re-opens to the public for in-person activities, will people need to show a \"vaccine passport\" or some proof of having been vaccinated in order to enter and partake of the in-person activities?\n\nCOUNCILLOR SOBRINHO-WHEELER:\n\n1. Now that the Johnson & Johnson vaccine has been authorized, when can we expect to start seeing doses in Massachusetts? What do residents need to know about which of the vaccines they\u2019re getting?\n\n2. New daily COVID cases in Cambridge have come down from the numbers we were seeing in December, but they are still 3-4 times higher than they were from June-October. What do we know about how Cambridge residents are currently contracting the virus? For what percentage of the cases are we able to identify a likely point of transmission?\n\nCOUNCILLOR TOOMEY:\n\n1. A lifelong Cambridge resident and senior citizen contacted me to express her concerns about the difficulty of getting the COVID-19 vaccine. The City of Quincy has a dedicated local vaccination site at their senior center; does Cambridge plan to set up a similar central site?\n\nCOUNCILLOR ZONDERVAN:\n\n1. Currently our 7-day average of new cases of COVID seems to have stabilized at about 4 times what it was in late March 2020 when we declared a public health emergency and shut down the entire city to prevent the spread of COVID. Several more infectious variants of COVID are circulating worldwide, including here in Massachusetts, raising the risk of a 4th surge driven by these new variants. Vaccine distribution in the city has been spotty and concerns of racial and economic inequities in terms of access to the vaccine have not been sufficiently addressed. Black and Brown community members in Cambridge are contracting COVID at rates at least 3 times higher than whites and are dying at rates 1.5 times higher than whites. I\u2019m hearing from concerned members of the community about their relatives dying and the city\u2019s failure to protect them. What is the scientific basis for reopening the city now to the degree that we are, including the complete lifting of indoor dining capacity limits and soon the opening of large venues, when our new case counts are stabilizing at such dangerously high levels, the risk of a 4th surge driven by variants is so great, and our Black and Brown community members remain disproportionately exposed?\n\n2. More than 1 year into this devastating pandemic, the city has repeatedly refused to adopt a housing for all approach, despite the availability of federal funding to reimburse 100% of the costs of providing non-congregate shelter. What is the justification for this inhumane approach that leaves unhoused people vulnerable to the winter weather, COVID exposure, and the enormous stresses and mental health challenges of living on the streets?\n\n3. Outdoor dining was a lifeline for many of our small businesses in 2020, can we get an update on when it will come back and in what form? How will we ensure that there is even better outreach to minority and women-owned businesses during the 2021 season? In particular, how can we bring the successes of Inman Square\u2019s approach (which included partial lane closures) to other neighborhoods that would benefit from such a dramatic intervention?\n\n4. Additional open space created through Memorial Drive closures and the Shared Streets program was a lifeline for many residents in 2020. When will Memorial Drive closures begin in 2021, and is the city supportive of expanding them beyond the weekend? How can we learn from the successes and challenges of the Shared Streets program to ensure all residents have access to legitimate recreation space, including and especially residents of the Port, Wellington-Harrington, and East Cambridge?\n\n",

      "full_text": " A communication transmitted from Louis A. DePasquale, City Manager, relative to the City of Cambridge retaining its AAA rating from the nation's three major credit rating agencies. I am pleased to inform you, the taxpayers, and all our residents that the City\nof Cambridge has again retained its noteworthy distinction of being one of\nonly 27 cities in the United States with AAA ratings from each of the nation\u2019s\nthree major credit rating agencies. Since 1999, the City has received these\nratings from Moody\u2019s Investors Service, S&P Global Ratings, and Fitch Ratings.  \n  \nThese ratings are especially significant this year, as the COVID-19 Pandemic\nresulted in unexpected levels of uncertainty and financial impacts not seen by\nthe City previously. The City has and continues to fund many new COVID-19\ninitiatives despite not being in the FY20 or FY21 budgets. Our ability to\nsupport these unforeseen initiatives is possible because the City is uniquely\npositioned financially due to our adherence to prudent fiscal policies and\npractices over the past several years.  \n  \nSince March 2020, when the COVID-19 crisis first emerged in Cambridge, the\nCity has developed, implemented, and monitored our public health strategies to\nslow the spread of the virus. The City has provided almost $25 million in\ndirect financial and community support to our most vulnerable residents during\nthe Pandemic. This support -- funded through various City, community and\nfederal funding sources -- has been distributed to the Housing Stabilization\nProgram, small business community, non-profit community, arts sector, various\nhomeless support programs, and Cambridge Public Schools.  \n  \nIn addition, the City has also appropriated $10.5 million through the\nCoronavirus Relief Fund received as part of the Federal Cares Act to the State\nof Massachusetts and allocated to cities and towns. Funds have been used\ntowards staff overtime costs related to COVID-19 testing sites and other\nprojects; personal protective equipment; services and supports to Cambridge\nresidents; meals for the homeless program; and activities and supports related\nto homeless services. The City has set up a COVID-19 Federal Emergency\nManagement Agency (\u201cFEMA\u201d) grant project. The City has spent approximately $18\nmillion to date on COVID-19 related expenses, and a portion of which the City\nanticipates will be reimbursed by FEMA.  \n\n  \nOur efforts are possible in part because of strong City management, sound\nfiscal policies set by the City Council, and a strong financial position that\nallows us to strategically use free cash reserves to support our COVID-19\npandemic response. Over the past year, we have demonstrated our ability to\nprovide essential city services while also supporting COVID-19 related\nservices and programs.  \n  \nAdditionally, despite the Pandemic's impacts, the City has remained committed\nto expanding support for important community initiatives, including affordable\nhousing, homelessness initiatives, infrastructure improvements and\nmaintenance, equity and diversity efforts, and supporting the small business\ncommunity.\n\nAchieving this credit rating allows the City to finance important projects\nthroughout Cambridge at the most favorable interest rate, which results in\nproperty tax savings to our taxpayers and increased financial flexibility,\nwhich has proven to be critical over the past year.  \n  \nThese ratings are in conjunction with the City\u2019s sale of $84.7 million in\nGeneral Obligation bonds as well as a refinancing of $21.3 million of existing\ndebt. It should be noted that refinancing of this existing debt is anticipated\nto result in significant savings to the City over the next several years. The\ncompetitive sale will take place on March 3, 2021.  \n  \nCapital projects funded in this bond issuance include DPW facilities repairs;\nstreet and sidewalk reconstruction; fire station renovations (River street and\nLexington Avenue); River Street reconstruction; City Hall improvements; Tobin\nMontessori and Vassal Lane Upper School construction; school improvement\nprojects; sewer reconstruction; and the Harvard Square Kiosk. The refinanced\ndebt was originally issued in 2010 and 2011 for the CRLS renovation, and 5\nWestern Avenue improvements (former Police Station).  \n  \nThe rating agencies highlighted the City\u2019s strong financial position; a large,\nstable, and diverse tax base; ample excess levy capacity under Proposition 2\n\u00bd; budgetary flexibility; and a strong and experienced management team.  \n  \nWhile our priorities over the past year have primarily focused on addressing\nimpacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic, we have been required to carefully manage\nand monitor our revenue and expenditures. This has become more complex during\nthe Pandemic. However, we have still continued to address ongoing city needs,\nbasic services, and many key initiatives.  \n  \nAs demonstrated in the following highlights from rating agencies, the City\u2019s\nability to maintain healthy reserves and budget flexibility and fiscal\nmanagement are considered strengths. Additionally, the agencies highlight the\nCity\u2019s prudent approach to developing expenditure and revenue projections has\nserved the City well and will need to continue in FY22. As part of this year\u2019s\ndocuments for the bond sale, the City was required to provide a COVID-19\ndisclosure statement that describes the budgetary impact of COVID-19 on the\ncurrent year operations and actions taken to address budgetary issues. As you\nrecall, in the fall when the City Council was required to take necessary tax\nclassification votes in order to set the FY21 tax rate through the Department\nof Revenue, reductions were made to non-property tax revenues, such as:\nHotel/Motel, Meals Excise, departmental revenues and State Aid. However, this\nincluded offsetting increases in revenues from the Debt and Health Claims\nStabilization Funds, Free Cash, Building Permits, other revenue adjustments\nand the use of one-time Agency funds. Additionally, adjustments included the\nrecission of $5 million from the General Fund Employee Benefits Budget to\nreflect estimated salary and fringe benefit savings based on vacant positions\nthat would not be filled quickly, mainly due to the current COVID-19 related\ncapacity restrictions. The above demonstrates our ability, working with the\nCity Council, to manage our resources and to make necessary adjustments.  \n  \nThe consistent recognition from the rating agencies reflects strong City\nCouncil fiscal policies and should be a source pride for the City.\nAdditionally, I would like to thank the City\u2019s Finance Team and Department\nHeads and staff for their commitment to managing their expenditures, revenues,\noperating and capital budgets, and programs in the face of unprecedented\nchallenges.  \n  \nListed below are highlights from the Moody\u2019s, Standard & Poor\u2019s, and Fitch\ncredit reports. Attached are the individual rating opinions.  \n  \nMoody\u2019s Investors Services  \n  \nSummary  \n  \nCambridge (Aaa stable) benefits from a large and diverse tax base that\ncontinues to experience strong growth. The city's economy is driven by the\npresence of Harvard University (Aaa stable) and Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology (MIT, Aaa stable) and the impressive research and development\nsector. Cambridge's financial position is strong with very healthy reserves\nand liquidity that are maintained by formal policies and conservative fiscal\nmanagement. Both the debt burden and long-term liabilities for pension and\nOPEB are conservatively managed and are expected to remain manageable.  \n\nCredit strengths\n\n\u00b7 Large tax base anchored by institutional presence and robust commercial\nsector\n\n\u00b7 Healthy financial position guided by formal policies and strong fiscal\nmanagement\n\n\u00b7 Ample operating flexibility with excess levy capacity under Proposition 2\u00bd\n\n\u00b7 Low adjusted net pension liability that will decline further given annual\npension contributions above the tread water metric  \n\nCredit challenges\n\n\u00b7 High regional cost of living and cost of business\n\n\u00b7 Taxpayer concentration in research and development  \n\nRating outlook\n\nThe stable outlook reflects the city\u2019s strong fiscal management that is\ncommitted to maintaining a healthy financial position given conservative\nmulti-year budget forecasting and adherence to formally adopted fiscal\npolicies. The outlook also incorporates the stabilizing presence of Harvard\nUniversity and MIT as well as the long historical trend of positive valuation\ngrowth in the tax base.  \n  \nFactors that could lead to a downgrade\n\n\u00b7 Material growth in the debt burden or unfunded long-term liabilities\n\n\u00b7 Significant deterioration in the tax base or weakening of the local economy\n\n\u00b7 Trend of operating deficits that lead to significant reduction in cash and\nreserves\n\nEnvironmental, Social, Government and Management (ESG) Considerations  \n  \nEnvironmental  \nEnvironmental risks are not material to the city's credit profile at this\ntime. Moody's affiliate Four Twenty Seven indicates that Middlesex County in\nwhich the city resides has high exposure to hurricanes, medium exposure to\nextreme rainfall, water stress and sea level rise and low exposure to heat\nstress. The city is committed to addressing environmental risk associated with\nflooding and heat exposure. To date, the most comprehensive mitigation\nprojects include improving natural barriers around the Alewife neighborhood as\nwell as heat mitigation efforts through its urban canopy-public shade tree\ninvestment program. Longer term the city expects to release its Climate Change\nPreparedness and Resilience Plan by the end of calendar year 2021. The plan\nwill include a net zero action plan for government, residential and commercial\ndevelopment. The plan was scheduled to be released in 2020 but has been\ndelayed due to challenges related to the coronavirus pandemic.  \n  \nSocial  \nCambridge leverages its strong credit profile by focusing on significant\ncommunity initiatives. These initiatives currently include a robust bike\nordinance, participatory budgeting that gives residents a voice in capital and\nother spending, the city providing a proportional share of funding towards the\nMBTA green line extension and offering a small business personal property tax\nexemption. Additionally, the city continues to increase its funding towards\naffordable housing projects. In fiscal 2020 a supplemental appropriation of\n$15 million was used to preserve 338 affordable housing units. In fiscal 2021\nthe city committed $12.3 million of Community Preservation Act funding and $15\nmillion from the capital budget to the Affordable Housing Trust to finance the\ncreation and preservation of new affordable housing.  \n  \nGovernance  \nThe city's experienced management team is very strong, as evidenced by the\nmaintenance of very healthy liquidity and reserves as well as adherence to\nformal fiscal policies, conservative multiyear budgeting and capital planning.  \n  \nFinancial operations and reserves: healthy financial position is expected to\nremain due to conservative budgeting and robust revenue growth  \n  \nThe city's financial position will likely remain strong over the near term\ngiven ample liquidity, robust revenue growth and operating flexibility under\nthe tax levy limit that are maintained by conservative fiscal management. The\nfiscal 2020 audited financials reflect the first year of declines in general\nfund reserves in many years due to transfers out to cover capital projects.\n\n  \nS&P Global  \n  \nCredit Overview  \nCambridge is an affluent suburb immediately adjacent to Boston. Home to both\nHarvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the\ncity is at the epicenter of biotech, pharmaceutical, and other knowledge-based\nsectors, which continue to generate growth in the tax base. It faces\nchallenges in addressing housing, transportation, and other infrastructure\nneeds. However, it has a history of significant forward-looking financial\nplanning and a track record of consistently outperforming the budget. We\nexpect Cambridge to remain a desirable location to live and work, sustaining\neconomic growth that will assist management in meeting future challenges.\nDespite a drawdown in reserves in fiscal 2020, which may continue into\nsubsequent years as the city works to balance its tax rate, balance sheet, and\ncapital needs, we believe it will maintain balanced long-term financial\nperformance and significant budgetary flexibility, given its high reserve\nlevels and unused levy capacity. The economic climate may continue to pressure\ncertain nontax revenues, but we do not expect to revise the rating over the\nnext two years.  \n  \nThe long-term rating reflects our view of the following factors:  \n\n\u00b7 Very strong economy, with access to a broad and diverse metropolitan\nstatistical area (MSA);\n\n\u00b7 Very strong management, with strong financial policies and practices under\nour Financial Management Assessment (FMA) methodology;\n\n\u00b7 Adequate budgetary performance, with operating results that we expect could\nimprove in the near term relative to fiscal 2020, which closed with an\noperating deficit in the general fund but an operating surplus at the total\ngovernmental fund level in fiscal 2020;\n\n\u00b7 Very strong budgetary flexibility, with an available fund balance in fiscal\n2020 of 43% of operating expenditures, and the flexibility to raise additional\nrevenues despite statewide tax caps;\n\n\u00b7 Very strong liquidity, with total government available cash at 54.2% of\ntotal governmental fund expenditures and 5.6x governmental debt service, and\naccess to external liquidity we consider strong;\n\n\u00b7 Adequate debt and contingent liability position, with debt service carrying\ncharges at 9.7% of expenditures and net direct debt that is 60.6% of total\ngovernmental fund revenue, as well as low overall net debt at less than 3% of\nmarket value and rapid amortization, with 83.3% of debt scheduled to be\nretired in 10 years, but a large pension and other postemployment benefit\n(OPEB) obligation; and\n\n\u00b7 Strong institutional framework score.\n\n  \n\n  \nEnvironmental, social, and governance factors\n\nThe rating incorporates our view regarding the health and safety risks posed\nby the COVID-19 Pandemic. Absent the implications of COVID-19, we consider the\ncity's social risks in line with those of the sector. While not directly on\nthe Atlantic Ocean, we believe Cambridge is vulnerable to environmental risks,\nincluding rising water levels from climate change that could directly affect\ntaxable properties. The city has a history of proactively addressing future\nchallenges, and, to this end, management maintains long-term plans to improve\nenvironmental resiliency. We analyzed Cambridge's governance risks relative to\nits economy, management, financial measures, and debt and liability profile,\nand determined that all are in line with our view of the sector standard.  \n  \nVery strong economy  \nWe consider Cambridge's economy very strong. The city, with a population of\n114,686, is in Middlesex County in the Boston-Cambridge-Newton MSA, which we\nconsider to be broad and diverse. It has a projected per capita effective\nbuying income of 169% of the national level and per capita market value of\n$525,216. Overall, market value grew by 9.6% over the past year to $60.2\nbillion in 2021. We expect Cambridge to continue to see growth in its tax base\nand believe its wealth and income metrics will remain stable.  \n  \nVery strong management  \nWe view the city's management as very strong, with strong financial policies\nand practices under our FMA methodology, indicating financial practices are\nstrong, well embedded, and likely sustainable.  \n  \nThe city's annual budget development process supports its overarching goals,\nwhich include significant investments in its education system, housing,\ntransportation network, and other quality-of-life issues, while maintaining\nfiscal balance. Active management of discretionary spending and ongoing\nmonitoring of intrayear spending ensure adherence to the adopted budget.\nBudget-to-actuals and investments are reported quarterly to the finance and\ninvestment committees, respectively. Management uses historical trend analysis\nto develop line-item and departmental expenditure and revenue assumptions.  \n  \nVery strong budgetary flexibility  \nCambridge's budgetary flexibility is very strong, in our view, with an\navailable fund balance in fiscal 2020 of 43% of operating expenditures, or\n$321.7 million. We expect the available fund balance to remain above 30% of\nexpenditures for the current and next fiscal years, which we view as a\npositive credit factor, along with the city's flexibility to raise additional\nrevenues despite statewide tax caps.  \n  \nWe expect budgetary flexibility to remain very strong, given the city's\nexisting reserves and significant flexibility under the levy limit. We include\nthe budget-stabilization fund in our calculations, which the city accounts for\nin committed general fund reserves. We do not anticipate a material change in\navailable reserves, despite increased use of reserves in the current fiscal\nyear. We also believe the city has significant flexibility under the state\nlevy cap. It currently has $187 million in unused levy capacity, about 25% of\nthe adopted 2021 operating budget expenditures.  \n\n  \nFitch Ratings  \n  \nThe City\u2019s \u2018AAA\u2019 GO bond rating and IDR reflect Fitch\u2019s expectation for\nCambridge to maintain a high level of financial flexibility through economic\ncycles, consistent with a history of strong operating performance and budget\ncontrols. The rating further reflects the City\u2019s wealthy resource base and\nfuture potential for continued tax base increases, along with moderate\nexpenditure growth and demonstrated ability to reduce expenditures during\neconomic downturns. Fitch expects long-term liabilities to remain low based on\nthe city\u2019s capital needs, very rapid pace of principal amortization, continued\ngrowth in economic resources and a practice of fully funding actuarially\ndetermined pension contributions.  \n  \nKey rating drivers  \n  \nRevenue Framework: 'aaa'  \nRevenues are derived primarily from property taxes and total annual general\nfund revenue growth over the past 10 fiscal years has exceeded both U.S.GDP\nand CPI for the same period, reflective of strong growth in Cambridge's\neconomy and tax base. Pandemic related declines in revenues and property\nvalues are likely to slow growth in the near term but prospects remain strong\nfor future advancement. The city maintains significant excess levy capacity\nunder the state's Proposition 2 1/2 law, providing for a high legal ability to\nraise revenues.  \n  \nExpenditure Framework: 'aa'  \nThe natural pace of spending growth is expected by Fitch to be in line with to\nbelow natural revenue growth over time. Carrying costs for debt and retiree\nbenefits claim a moderate proportion of governmental spending. Fitch expects\ncarrying costs to remain moderate even with future debt issuances and annual\nincreases in other-post employment benefit {OPEB) and pension contributions.\nThe city maintains strong legal control over headcount and other key\nemployment terms as provided by state statute.  \n  \nLong-Term Liability Burden:'aaa'  \nCambridge's direct debt, net of water and sewer debt paid from user charges,\nand Fitch\u00ad adjusted net pension liabilities {NPL) are low at approximately 6%\nof residents' personal income. Fitch anticipates Cambridge's long-term\nliability burden will remain in line with the 'aaa' assessment based on\nexpected growth in the city's population and personal income, future debt\nplans, and a rapid pace of principal amortization. OPEB liabilities compared\nto personal income are high, but management is actively managing these costs.  \n  \nOperating Performance:'aaa'  \nCareful expenditure management combined with moderate tax levy increases that\nhave aligned with tax base changes and conservative financial forecasting have\nled to the maintenance of considerable reserves over the past decade. Fitch\nexpects the city will continue to demonstrate a high level of financial\nresilience and gap-closing ability throughout the current and future economic\ncycles  \n  \nRating Sensitivities  \n  \nFactors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating\naction/downgrade:\n\n\u00b7 Failure to implement available policy measures that offset risks associated\nwith a return to economic contraction consistent with Fitch's coronavirus\ndownside scenario, resulting in an erosion of the city's gap-closing capacity;\n\n\u00b7 Although not expected, a significant decline in taxable assessed values\nleading to substantial diminishment of the city's excess banked levy capacity.  \n\nOperating Performance\n\nFitch expects the city to maintain a high level of financial resilience\nthroughout the current and future economic cycles given its historically\nstrong revenue performance, conservative budgeting practices and superior\ndegree of inherent budget flexibility. The steady growth in revenues has\nsupported surplus operations over the past several fiscal years and the city\nhas built up its reserves to high levels, supporting its high level of\nfinancial flexibility.  \n  \nDuring times of economic weakness, management has controlled spending and\nstaffing levels to offset reductions in revenues and Fitch expects management\nwill continue this practice during the current slowdown. The city's strong\nbudget monitoring practices and financial planning bolster the city's\noperating environment.\n\n",

The Planning Board may grant a Quadrangle\nNorthwest Master Plan Special Permit, incorporating any approved special\npermits for the Development Parcel, subject to the following provisions:\n\n(a) Criteria. In addition to the general special permit criteria set forth in\nSection 10.43, the Project Review Special Permit criteria set forth in Section\n19.25, and all other criteria applicable to the special permits being sought,\nthe Planning Board shall find that the following criteria are met when\ngranting a Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Special Permit:\n\n(1) The Master Plan is in substantial conformance with the vision, goals, and\nrecommendations set forth in the Alewife District Plan, including any\namendments to the Alewife District Plan or future City planning reports that\naddress the Alewife District, including but not limited to the topics of land\nuse, open space, urban form, mobility, climate and environment, housing,\neconomy, and zoning, and with any urban design guidelines published by the\nCity pursuant to the Alewife District Plan or any amendments thereto or future\nplanning reports that address the Alewife District;\n\n(2) The Master Plan is in substantial conformance with applicable standards\nfor flood and heat resilience recommended through the City\u2019s Climate Change\nPreparedness and Resilience planning efforts or future climate change planning\nefforts; and\n\n(3) The Master Plan will result in the completion of a publicly accessible\nconnection for bicyclists and pedestrians, at a minimum, across the railroad\nright of way between the Triangle District and the Quadrangle Northwest\nDistrict, with conditions incorporated into the project phasing that will\nensure its completion. A connection that accommodates passenger shuttles is\ndesirable.\n\n(4) Housing - The revised zoning requires that a development proposal must be\nin general conformance with the Alewife District Plan, which would include\nland use. The Alewife District Plan calls for residential use west of the\nextension of Spinelli Place, which is about 40-50% of the anticipated\ndevelopment area. If desired, the Council could add provisions in the\n\u201cCriteria for Approval\u201d section such as a minimum amount or percentage of\nresidential use, and/or requirements for phasing. An approach used in past\nmixed-use developments has been to require the residential phase to commence\nbefore 60% of permitted commercial uses are built, and to complete the\nresidential phase before or concurrently with the completion of commercial\nuses. Within these constraints, a timing and phasing plan for the development\nwould be subject to review and approval by the Planning Board.\n\n(5) Parking - This is also part of the required conformance with the Alewife\nDistrict Plan as included in the revised text. As in other areas of\nredevelopment, the Alewife District Plan anticipates that parking would be\nused flexibly to serve uses throughout the area at different times while\nminimizing the number of parking spaces provided. Minimum parking ratios by\nuse would be eliminated except for a smaller minimum for housing to mitigate\npossible impacts on public street parking, and maximum parking ratios by use\nwould be established as follows:\n\na. Retail: maximum 1.5 per 1,000 SF\n\nb. Office: maximum 1.1 per 1,000 SF\n\nc. R&D: maximum 0.8 per 1,000 SF\n\nd. Industrial: maximum 0.5 per 1,000 SF\n\ne. Residential: maximum 0.75 per dwelling unit, minimum .25 per dwelling unit\n\n(b) Conditions. The Quadrangle Northwest District Master Plan Special Permit\nshall set forth conditions to ensure that the applicable criteria are met,\nincluding but not limited to the following conditions:\n\n(1) Approved land uses and dimensional characteristics of the Master Plan at\nan aggregate level and for individual building sites;\n\n(2) Required public improvements and other benefits such as infrastructure and\nopen space;\n\n(3) Required measures to mitigate development impacts, including but not\nlimited to transportation impacts and construction activity;\n\n(4) Procedures for review and approval of the designs of individual buildings,\nopen spaces, public improvements, and other components of the Master Plan; and\n\n(5) Timing and phasing for completion of the different components of the\nMaster Plan, including but not limited to required public improvements,\nbenefits, and mitigation.\n\n(c) Commencement. The commencement of construction of any single building\napproved in a Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Special Permit shall constitute\nexercise of the special permit for purposes of M.G.L. Chapter 40A and Section\n10.46 of this Zoning Ordinance. The timing of completion shall be set forth by\nthe Planning Board in the conditions of the special permit, which timing may\nbe extended by the Planning Board upon a showing of good cause, and shall be\nsubject to other conditions related to timing and phasing set forth in the\nspecial permit conditions.\n\n(d) Amendments. A Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Special Permit may identify\nspecific modifications to the Master Plan that may be subject to future\napproval by a written determination of the Planning Board. Otherwise, the\nPlanning Board shall determine whether a proposed modification is a Major\nAmendment or Minor Amendment according to the standards set forth in Sections\n12.37.1 through 12.37.3 of this Zoning Ordinance.\n\n20.930.4 Modifications to Standards. Except as otherwise set forth herein, any\nproject receiving a Quadrangle Northwest District Master Plan Special Permit\nshall comply with all other applicable development standards set forth in this\nZoning Ordinance. The following modifications may be authorized by the\nPlanning Board upon granting a Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Special\nPermit:\n\n(1) The Additional FAR provisions of Paragraph (1) of Section 20.95.11 of this\nZoning Ordinance may be applied to a Quadrangle Northwest Development Parcel\nin its entirety if the proposed development incorporates construction of a\npublicly accessible pedestrian and bicycle bridge connection across the\nrailroad right of way between the Quadrangle Northwest District and the\nTriangle District or incorporation of structural elements into a building's\ndesign that includes or would permit future construction of such a pedestrian\nconnection (that are acceptable to the City for that purpose), as well as the\nconveyance (in a form acceptable to the City) of the necessary fee or easement\nproperty interests in land that would permit access to such a connection, in a\nmanner and to an extent determined to be sufficient to significantly advance\nthe objectives of the Alewife District Plan .\n\n(2) The height of any building, regardless of use, may be increased to a\nmaximum of eighty-five (85) feet, but shall remain subject to the limitations\nof Section 20.95.2, Paragraph 1(a) within 100 feet or 200 feet of a\nresidential or Open Space district, provided the Planning Board finds that the\nentire leasable ground story of any non-residential building (excluding\nentrances/exits, lobbies, circulation, utilities, loading, and other functions\nnecessary to serve upper-story uses or the building as a whole) is planned,\ndesigned, and constructed for the occupancy of light industrial uses and/or\nbusinesses that require light industrial space but also include a consumer-\nfacing or community-focused component as described in the Economy\nRecommendations of the Alewife District Plan, with floor-to-ceiling heights\nthat the Board finds to be suitable for such uses. The Planning Board may\napprove a limited number of Retail and Consumer Service Establishments to\nprovide neighborhood amenities if they do not collectively occupy more than\ntwenty percent (20%) of any building\u2019s total Ground Story and the Board finds\nthat they do not detract from the emphasis on light industrial spaces as\ndescribed in the Alewife District Plan. A residential building, which may\ninclude above-grade structured parking that is located to the rear of and\nvisually screened from the street by principal-use residential space, may also\nbe increased to a maximum of eight-five (85) feet without being required to\nmeet the other requirements of this Paragraph.\n\n(3) If the Planning Board finds that the ground story of any building requires\nelevation above the existing mean grade in order to conform to flood\nresilience standards as established by the City, then the maximum height of\nany building may be further increased by not more than four (4) feet or the\ndifference between the ground story finished floor elevation and the existing\nmean grade, whichever is lesser. To make such finding, the Planning Board\nshall have received and reviewed a written report from the City Engineer\ndescribing flood resilience standards applicable and the impact of those\nstandards to the development site.\n\n(4) Spaces within the ground story of any non-residential building that are\nreserved for light industrial uses or businesses that require light industrial\nspace but also include a consumer-facing or community-focused component as\ndescribed in the Economy Recommendations of the Alewife District Plan may be\nexcluded from the calculation of Gross Floor Area for the purpose of applying\nthe limitations and requirements of this Zoning Ordinance, provided that the\ndimensions of such spaces, their permitted range of approved uses, and other\nconditions to ensure that the intent of the Alewife District Plan is met shall\nbe set forth in writing by the Planning Board in the Quadrangle Northwest\nMaster Plan Special Permit.\n\n(5) Applicable minimum parking requirements shall be waived, and the Planning\nBoard shall set forth maximum limitations and other conditions pertaining to\nthe development and operation of off-street parking facilities in accordance\nwith the Mobility Recommendations of the Alewife District Plan.\n\n(6) Applicable yard requirements and limitations, with the exception of\nrequirements for yards abutting a residential or Open Space district as set\nforth in Paragraph (2) of Section 20.95.31 of this Zoning Ordinance, shall be\nmodified to the extent necessary to conform to the recommended building\nsetbacks and street sections recommended in the Urban Form and Mobility\nRecommendations of the Alewife District Plan, as approved by the Planning\nBoard.\n\n",

The CHA announced yesterday that they would not be receiving any new doses of vaccines. How will that impact the announced CHA vaccine site in Somerville (next to Target) from last week's meeting?\n\n2. There seems to be an uptick in CPS staff COVID cases, from 53 on 2/21 to 59 on 2/22 which seem to be clustered at the FMA. What is being done to contain this uptick among staff at FMA?\n\n3. Please give an update on vaccinations for our low-income elderly population through the onsite program with CHA. How many have been vaccinated, how many are left, what is the plan to finish vaccinating this vulnerable group?\n\nCOUNCILLOR NOLAN:\n\n1. From a public health perspective, a number of people have expressed concern about the impact of the pandemic on routine health care. Covid-19 meant the availability of routine health screenings and visits declined the past year - due to people either staying away from doctor\u2019s offices or not being able to schedule in person visits. Did Cambridge residents experience this - or was telehealth able to fill in adequately? For our most vulnerable populations, is there anything the public health department is doing or can be doing to ensure that the pandemic related challenges in getting routine health care does not have long-term adverse effects? \n\n2. What is the status of applications for funds available for residents and businesses suffering from the economic impact of the pandemic - residents unable to pay rent or mortgages, businesses, or organizations at risk of closure. Have we seen the need for more funds to be allocated or have the efforts to date met most of the most urgent needs, from what we can tell?\n\nMAYOR SIDDIQUI:\n\n1. What is the efficacy of the vaccines on the new COVID-19 variants? Can you share some information on the Johnson & Johnson vaccine?\n\n2. Do we have any information on boosters being developed to address variants that emerge?\n\n3. How has our messaging changed around masking changed? Should everyone be double masking? \n\nCOUNCILLOR SIMMONS:\n\n1. We learned that the Cambridge Housing Authority was able to help vaccinate seniors right inside their senior buildings, bringing the vaccines to them instead of forcing the seniors to drive to vaccination centers - how will we find and reach other home bound seniors (such as those in 1221 Cambridge Street and other non-CHA buildings) who do not have the ability to go to public vaccination sites? \n\n2. As more vaccine doses become available in the coming weeks and months, what long-term plans does the Cambridge Public Health Department have to vaccinate all our seniors and those with mobility issues?\n\n",

Cambridge is a close community of individuals who are here for one\nanother and we have to show compassion and hold each other in this moment.\nThis year has been so difficult, especially for our youth, and it is\nimperative that we are able to create a space where everyone feels safe to\nreach out to a trusted adult and talk through any feelings of loss, grief,\nmental health struggles, or suicidal thoughts.\n\nHere are some resources that my Office has been sharing:\n\n\u00b7 CRLS Teen Health Center: (617) 665-1548 | [Appointment\nInformation](https://crls.cpsd.us/academics/student_services/teen_health_center)\n\n\u00b7 NAMI: (617) 984-0527 | [Support Groups](https://nami-\ncambridgemiddlesex.org/programs/support-groups/)\n\n\u00b7 Trevor Project (LGBTQ+ youth): (866) 488-7386 | text 678678\n\n\u00b7 National Suicide Prevention Hotline: (800) 273-8255 | [Online\nChat](http://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/chat/)\n\n\u00b7 Riverside Trauma Center: (888) 851-2451 | [Tips on Coping- How We React to a\nDeath](file:///C:\\\\Users\\\\lmurray\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\INetCache\\\\Content.Outlook\\\\AOR1V1K5\\\\\u2022https:\\\\drive.google.com\\\\open?id=0B7RXkT6rqb3ENmRIa0V5WEtzQkVDQ09kczNTUGpub1hwVk1B)\n\nAt the school level, CRLS held a moment of silence in remembrance of Sina\nduring Block 3 classes on Wednesday, February 24th and made sure to have\nSchool Social Workers, School Psychologists, administrators, and staff from\nthe Riverside Trauma Center available to meet with and provide support to\nstudents and staff both in-person and remotely.\n\nStaff members are also able to utilize the [Employee Assistance Program\n(EAP)](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.cpsd.us/UserFiles/Servers/Server_3042785/File/departments/administration/hr/Deer_Oaks_Brochure.pdf__;!!GolgDdAAPFHvrrz0!KGsWw91j8fCCTReApy1NWrUXgAUvDzSscVXCVJUIwTnSnKPyw0knZgDahSp184O_A-w$)\nwhich provides free and confidential assessments, short-term counseling,\nreferrals, prevention, and education services for staff and their dependents.\nServices are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, all year.\n\nAt 7:30 PM on Thursday, February 25th, the School Committee is having a\nSpecial Meeting to adopt an Interim Superintendent job posting and an initial\ntimeline for the Superintendent Search.

The Planning Board may grant a Quadrangle\nNorthwest Master Plan Special Permit, incorporating any approved special\npermits for the Development Parcel, subject to the following provisions:\n\n(a) Criteria. In addition to the general special permit criteria set forth in\nSection 10.43, the Project Review Special Permit criteria set forth in Section\n19.25, and all other criteria applicable to the special permits being sought,\nthe Planning Board shall find that the following criteria are met when\ngranting a Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Special Permit:\n\n(1) The Master Plan is in substantial conformance with the vision, goals, and\nrecommendations set forth in the Alewife District Plan, including any\namendments to the Alewife District Plan or future City planning reports that\naddress the Alewife District, including but not limited to the topics of land\nuse, open space, urban form, mobility, climate and environment, housing,\neconomy, and zoning, and with any urban design guidelines published by the\nCity pursuant to the Alewife District Plan or any amendments thereto or future\nplanning reports that address the Alewife District;\n\n(2) The Master Plan is in substantial conformance with applicable standards\nfor flood and heat resilience recommended through the City\u2019s Climate Change\nPreparedness and Resilience planning efforts or future climate change planning\nefforts; and\n\n(3) The Master Plan will result in the completion of a publicly accessible\nconnection for bicyclists and pedestrians, at a minimum, across the railroad\nright of way between the Triangle District and the Quadrangle Northwest\nDistrict, with conditions incorporated into the project phasing that will\nensure its completion. A connection that accommodates passenger shuttles is\ndesirable.\n\n(4) Housing - The revised zoning requires that a development proposal must be\nin general conformance with the Alewife District Plan, which would include\nland use. The Alewife District Plan calls for residential use west of the\nextension of Spinelli Place, which is about 40-50% of the anticipated\ndevelopment area. If desired, the Council could add provisions in the\n\u201cCriteria for Approval\u201d section such as a minimum amount or percentage of\nresidential use, and/or requirements for phasing. An approach used in past\nmixed-use developments has been to require the residential phase to commence\nbefore 60% of permitted commercial uses are built, and to complete the\nresidential phase before or concurrently with the completion of commercial\nuses. Within these constraints, a timing and phasing plan for the development\nwould be subject to review and approval by the Planning Board.\n\n(5) Parking - This is also part of the required conformance with the Alewife\nDistrict Plan as included in the revised text. As in other areas of\nredevelopment, the Alewife District Plan anticipates that parking would be\nused flexibly to serve uses throughout the area at different times while\nminimizing the number of parking spaces provided. Minimum parking ratios by\nuse would be eliminated except for a smaller minimum for housing to mitigate\npossible impacts on public street parking, and maximum parking ratios by use\nwould be established as follows:\n\na. Retail: maximum 1.5 per 1,000 SF\n\nb. Office: maximum 1.1 per 1,000 SF\n\nc. R&D: maximum 0.8 per 1,000 SF\n\nd. Industrial: maximum 0.5 per 1,000 SF\n\ne. Residential: maximum 0.75 per dwelling unit, minimum .25 per dwelling unit\n\n(b) Conditions. The Quadrangle Northwest District Master Plan Special Permit\nshall set forth conditions to ensure that the applicable criteria are met,\nincluding but not limited to the following conditions:\n\n(1) Approved land uses and dimensional characteristics of the Master Plan at\nan aggregate level and for individual building sites;\n\n(2) Required public improvements and other benefits such as infrastructure and\nopen space;\n\n(3) Required measures to mitigate development impacts, including but not\nlimited to transportation impacts and construction activity;\n\n(4) Procedures for review and approval of the designs of individual buildings,\nopen spaces, public improvements, and other components of the Master Plan; and\n\n(5) Timing and phasing for completion of the different components of the\nMaster Plan, including but not limited to required public improvements,\nbenefits, and mitigation.\n\n(c) Commencement. The commencement of construction of any single building\napproved in a Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Special Permit shall constitute\nexercise of the special permit for purposes of M.G.L. Chapter 40A and Section\n10.46 of this Zoning Ordinance. The timing of completion shall be set forth by\nthe Planning Board in the conditions of the special permit, which timing may\nbe extended by the Planning Board upon a showing of good cause, and shall be\nsubject to other conditions related to timing and phasing set forth in the\nspecial permit conditions.\n\n(d) Amendments. A Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Special Permit may identify\nspecific modifications to the Master Plan that may be subject to future\napproval by a written determination of the Planning Board. Otherwise, the\nPlanning Board shall determine whether a proposed modification is a Major\nAmendment or Minor Amendment according to the standards set forth in Sections\n12.37.1 through 12.37.3 of this Zoning Ordinance.\n\n20.930.4 Modifications to Standards. Except as otherwise set forth herein, any\nproject receiving a Quadrangle Northwest District Master Plan Special Permit\nshall comply with all other applicable development standards set forth in this\nZoning Ordinance. The following modifications may be authorized by the\nPlanning Board upon granting a Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Special\nPermit:\n\n(1) The Additional FAR provisions of Paragraph (1) of Section 20.95.11 of this\nZoning Ordinance may be applied to a Quadrangle Northwest Development Parcel\nin its entirety if the proposed development incorporates construction of a\npublicly accessible pedestrian and bicycle bridge connection across the\nrailroad right of way between the Quadrangle Northwest District and the\nTriangle District or incorporation of structural elements into a building's\ndesign that includes or would permit future construction of such a pedestrian\nconnection (that are acceptable to the City for that purpose), as well as the\nconveyance (in a form acceptable to the City) of the necessary fee or easement\nproperty interests in land that would permit access to such a connection, in a\nmanner and to an extent determined to be sufficient to significantly advance\nthe objectives of the Alewife District Plan .\n\n(2) The height of any building, regardless of use, may be increased to a\nmaximum of eighty-five (85) feet, but shall remain subject to the limitations\nof Section 20.95.2, Paragraph 1(a) within 100 feet or 200 feet of a\nresidential or Open Space district, provided the Planning Board finds that the\nentire leasable ground story of any non-residential building (excluding\nentrances/exits, lobbies, circulation, utilities, loading, and other functions\nnecessary to serve upper-story uses or the building as a whole) is planned,\ndesigned, and constructed for the occupancy of light industrial uses and/or\nbusinesses that require light industrial space but also include a consumer-\nfacing or community-focused component as described in the Economy\nRecommendations of the Alewife District Plan, with floor-to-ceiling heights\nthat the Board finds to be suitable for such uses. The Planning Board may\napprove a limited number of Retail and Consumer Service Establishments to\nprovide neighborhood amenities if they do not collectively occupy more than\ntwenty percent (20%) of any building\u2019s total Ground Story and the Board finds\nthat they do not detract from the emphasis on light industrial spaces as\ndescribed in the Alewife District Plan. A residential building, which may\ninclude above-grade structured parking that is located to the rear of and\nvisually screened from the street by principal-use residential space, may also\nbe increased to a maximum of eight-five (85) feet without being required to\nmeet the other requirements of this Paragraph.\n\n(3) If the Planning Board finds that the ground story of any building requires\nelevation above the existing mean grade in order to conform to flood\nresilience standards as established by the City, then the maximum height of\nany building may be further increased by not more than four (4) feet or the\ndifference between the ground story finished floor elevation and the existing\nmean grade, whichever is lesser. To make such finding, the Planning Board\nshall have received and reviewed a written report from the City Engineer\ndescribing flood resilience standards applicable and the impact of those\nstandards to the development site.\n\n(4) Spaces within the ground story of any non-residential building that are\nreserved for light industrial uses or businesses that require light industrial\nspace but also include a consumer-facing or community-focused component as\ndescribed in the Economy Recommendations of the Alewife District Plan may be\nexcluded from the calculation of Gross Floor Area for the purpose of applying\nthe limitations and requirements of this Zoning Ordinance, provided that the\ndimensions of such spaces, their permitted range of approved uses, and other\nconditions to ensure that the intent of the Alewife District Plan is met shall\nbe set forth in writing by the Planning Board in the Quadrangle Northwest\nMaster Plan Special Permit.\n\n(5) Applicable minimum parking requirements shall be waived, and the Planning\nBoard shall set forth maximum limitations and other conditions pertaining to\nthe development and operation of off-street parking facilities in accordance\nwith the Mobility Recommendations of the Alewife District Plan.\n\n(6) Applicable yard requirements and limitations, with the exception of\nrequirements for yards abutting a residential or Open Space district as set\nforth in Paragraph (2) of Section 20.95.31 of this Zoning Ordinance, shall be\nmodified to the extent necessary to conform to the recommended building\nsetbacks and street sections recommended in the Urban Form and Mobility\nRecommendations of the Alewife District Plan, as approved by the Planning\nBoard.\n\n",

I am writing to submit the attached Zoning Petition which amends Article 8.000\nof the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance. The Law Department, along with the\nCommunity Development Department and Inspectional Services Department, have\nprepared this Petition to amend the Zoning Ordinance in order to comply with\nG.L. c.40A, \u00a76.  \n  \nA recent case from the Supreme Judicial Court (the \u201cSJC\u201d) has interpreted G.L.\nc.40A, \u00a76 to provide special protections to lawful preexisting nonconforming\nsingle and two-family dwellings. Bellalta v. Zoning Board of Appeals of\nBrookline, 481 Mass. 372 (2019). Specifically, the SJC held that if an\nalteration or addition to a lawful preexisting nonconforming single and two-\nfamily dwelling increases an existing dimensional nonconformity, but does not\ncreate any new dimensional nonconformities, the property owner is only\nrequired to obtain a special permit for the alteration or addition, and not a\nvariance. This holding is limited to lawful preexisting nonconforming single\nand two-family dwellings. This holding is also in conflict with Article 8.000\nof the Zoning Ordinance because presently in certain instances the Zoning\nOrdinance requires that a property owner obtain a variance for alterations or\nadditions to a lawful preexisting nonconforming single and two-family\ndwelling, even where no new nonconformities are created.  \n  \nAs an example, if a single or two-family dwelling is lawfully preexisting\nnonconforming because it exceeds the allowable Floor Area Ratio (\u201cFAR\u201d) and\nthe property owner has planned an addition that will further exceed the FAR\nbut not create a new nonconformity, by law the Zoning Ordinance cannot require\nthe property owner to obtain a variance to allow the addition. Rather, that\naddition requires the grant of a special permit and finding that the proposed\nadditional will not be substantially more detrimental than the existing\npreexisting nonconforming structure to the neighborhood.  \n  \nThis Petition is necessary to bring the Zoning Ordinance into conformance with\nthe SJC\u2019s interpretation of G.L. c.40A, \u00a76. The Law Department, Community\nDevelopment Department and Inspectional Services Department will be available\nto discuss this Petition with you and with the Planning Board throughout the\nzoning amendment process.\n\n",

DePasquale, City Manager, relative to the appropriation of $1,000,000 from the Community Benefits Stabilization Fund to the Grant Fund Human Services Other Ordinary Maintenance for the purpose of entering into grant agreements with nonprofit organizations to provide services to vulnerable residents during the COVID-19 emergency and recovery. I am hereby requesting the appropriation of $1,000,000 from the Community\nBenefits Stabilization Fund to the Grant Fund Human Services Other Ordinary\nMaintenance for the purpose of entering into grant agreements with nonprofit\norganizations to provide services to vulnerable residents during the COVID 19\nemergency and recovery. The City Council previously approved my request for an\nappropriation of $1 million dollars from the Community Benefits Stabilization\nFund for this purpose on May 18, 2020. Those funds were awarded to 106\ncommunity-based organizations based on recommendations from the Community\nBenefits Advisory Committee. Based on the continuing needs related to the\nCOVID-19 pandemic and the capacity of Cambridge\u2019s not for profit community to\naddress those needs, I am recommending the appropriation of the additional $1\nmillion dollars.  \n  \nPursuant to Chapter 2.127 of the Cambridge Municipal Code, the Community\nBenefits Advisory Committee (CBAC) is charged with soliciting and evaluating\napplications for the use of community benefits funds from community-based\norganizations based on priorities established by the City Council. The City\nCouncil voted on a broad set of priorities when it adopted the 2017 Community\nNeeds Assessment, which can be viewed at\n<https://www.cambridgema.gov/CDD/News/2-17/communityneedsassessmentreport>.\nThe Needs Assessment is very comprehensive and continues to provide important,\nbroad guidance. That needs assessment was considered by CBAC in designing the\nsimple application and speedy decision-making process by which the $1 million\ndollars was allocated last summer.  \n  \nOur nonprofit community provides basic needs and other critical supports for\nlow-income, under-resourced, and vulnerable families and individuals at risk.\nThe Cambridge Nonprofit Coalition has surveyed the nonprofit community twice\nand heard about both the deep needs of our residents as well the increased\nfinancial stress of the not for profits even as many of them have received a\nvariety of different grants through the City or other funders. The use of\nCommunity Benefits Funds through grant agreements with nonprofit organizations\nwill provide additional COVID-19 related assistance and critical supports to\nboth the nonprofit organizations and to our residents impacted by the COVID-19\npandemic.  \n  \nIf this appropriation is approved, CBAC will proceed with a process closely\nfollowing the successful process by which the earlier $1 million was awarded\nin grants.  \n  \nThe City Council should be proud of the assistance the City has been able to\nprovide to its residents, small businesses and nonprofits through the Mayor's\nDisaster Relief Fund, the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority, federal Community\nDevelopment Block Grant and CARES funding, the Housing Stabilization Fund and\nthe Community Benefits Fund.\n\n",

I am hereby requesting the appropriation of $5,717,250 from the Mitigation\nStabilization Fund to the Public Investment Fund Department of Public Works\nExtraordinary Expenditures account.

These funds, in combination with\nprevious contributions from Alexandria Real Estate Equities ($9,500,000) and\nBoston Properties Inc. ($2,000,000), will be used to fund the design and\nconstruction of three new parks in the East Cambridge/Kendall Square area;\nTimothy J.

Toomey, Jr. Park (formerly Rogers Street\nPark) is currently underway and is expected to be completed by fall 2021. This\nnew 2.2-acre neighborhood park includes play areas, sand and water play, a new\npermanent dog run, and picnic seating areas and benches around the park. The\nproject also includes a park maintenance storage area that will facilitate the\nuse of green park maintenance equipment in the East Cambridge area.  \n\n\u00b7 Construction at the 2/3-acre Triangle Park is anticipated to begin in spring\n2021 and be completed by late 2022. The proposed design has been updated to\nemphasize tree plantings and canopy growth\n<https://www.cambridgema.gov/-/media/Files/CDD/ParksandOpenSpace/ParkProjects/EasternCambridge/Triangle_RevisionTwoPager_20200811_WEB.pdf>\nin an area of the city that has relatively less canopy coverage, in accordance\nwith the recommendations of the Urban Forest Master Planning process, while\nretaining the passive quality that was the intent of the original park design.\nNearly 400 new trees will be planted, creating an urban grove of trees to\nprovide high quality natural shade over movable seating and furniture.  \n\n\u00b7 The 1-acre Binney Street Park is to be a future dog park and will include a\nportion of the Grand Junction Multi-Use Path. The design and construction\ndocuments for this project are substantially complete. The schedule for the\nconstruction of this project is being finalized, pending coordination with\nadjacent improvements on Binney Street and the routing of Eversource\ntransmission lines in the area.  \n\nThis funding, in combination with previous appropriations, is anticipated to\ncover the design and construction of all 3 new parks, based on current project\nestimates. Those estimates were created by professional designers and include\nstandard construction contingencies. However, if the bids come in higher than\nestimated, I anticipate coming back to the Council for an additional\nappropriation in order to complete these 3 critical new public open spaces in\nEast Cambridge.\n\n",

In response to Awaiting Report 19-75, regarding the feasibility of partnering\nwith a local research institution to conduct a study that determines how many\nridehail vehicles are on the roads during both on and off-peak times and their\nimpacts on congestion and safety, Director of Traffic, Parking, and\nTransportation Joseph Barr and Assistant City Manager for Community\nDevelopment Iram Farooq report the following:  \n  \nOver the past few months, City staff have entered into initial discussions\nwith research staff from the Department of Urban Studies and Planning at the\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology, to explore the feasibility of obtaining\nmore detailed data on trips made in ridehail vehicles (also known as\nTransportation Network Companies, or TNCs). Currently, the only information\ndirectly available to cities and towns is the total number of passenger pick-\nups within each municipality in each calendar year, which is reported as part\nof the10\u00a2 per ride fee that is transferred to each municipality from the\nDepartment of Public Utilities (which is responsible for regulating TNCs in\nMassachusetts). Because the City does not have the authority to further\nregulate TNCs, access to any data beyond the aggregate yearly total of\npassenger pick ups would require voluntary participation on the part of the\nTNCs. Although the recently passed Transportation Bond Bill (H.5248-An Act\nAuthorizing and Accelerating Transportation Investment) included language\nrequiring additional detailed data reporting from TNCs, those sections were\nvetoed by the Governor and it is unclear if and when such requirements might\nbe considered again in the future.  \n  \nAs members of the City Council may be aware, the two principal TNCs that\noperate in Massachusetts are Uber and Lyft, and both have been reluctant to\nshare detailed data about the pick-up and drop off locations of trips that are\nenabled by their applications, for both customer privacy and competitive\nreasons. This is particularly the case with government agencies, since the\ndata would then be subject to a public records request, potentially leading to\nthe disclosure of information that the TNCs consider confidential and/or\nproprietary. However, as the original policy order notes, there have been some\ncases in other locations where the TNCs have been willing to share data with\nprivate research institutions that are not subject to public records requests,\nwho can then analyze and present data to government agencies in a form that\ncan be released publicly without compromising private and/or sensitive\ninformation.  \n  \nBased on these successful examples, we have begun discussion with MIT\nresearchers on this topic, since there are multiple faculty who have prior\nexperience working with TNCs on research and data issues, although not in\nexactly the same manner as contemplated in this policy order. Based on these\ndiscussions, there are potential overall questions that could be explored if\nthe TNCs were willing to provide access to additional data:  \n\n\u00b7 More detailed information on pick up and drop off locations, including data\nthat is stratified by time of the day, day of the week, or time of the year.\nIn addition to helping the City understand where we may want to establish pick\nup and drop zones for TNCs, this could also help us understand the variability\nof demand and the locations where TNCs may be causing congestion.\n\n\u00b7 Information about TNCs operating without passengers, either when traveling\nto a pick-up or when they have completed a drop off and have not yet picked\nanother trip. It\u2019s important to note that analyzing these so-called \u201cdeadhead\u201d\ntrips can be complicated by the fact that many drivers operate for both TNCs,\nsuch that these trips can sometimes be double counted across both networks, or\nan active trip being made on one TNC might appear as deadhead time on the\nother TNC.\n\n\u00b7 Information about what percentage of TNC rides are shared, as well as\ndetails about the fares that are charged to customers. This information would\nbe helpful in understanding current trends and future potential for\nridesharing. Maximizing the number of trips that can be shared is an important\ngoal for the City.\n\nBased on these initial discussions, the MIT research staff we have been\ntalking to are working on drafting an initial data request letter to be sent\nto representatives of both Uber and Lyft, asking to initiate more detailed\ndiscussions regarding the potential to share data of various types and levels\nof detail. Working with MIT has the potential to create a partnership with\nresearchers who are highly skilled in data analytics and will be able to\nanalyze and synthesize the data to help us develop technical conclusions and\npolicy recommendations. Based on discussions with regional partners, we also\nbelieve that there is the potential to successfully apply for grants for this\nproject, to support the technical research that MIT staff and students would\nbe performing.  \n  \nAlthough we are not assured of success in developing this data sharing\npartnership, we believe that it is an effort worth pursuing. We will continue\nto keep the City Council updated on the progress that we make, both in setting\nup the data sharing and analysis partnership, and in the results of the\nanalysis. We are also interested to learn more about any specific questions\nthat the Council may be interested in answering with this data, and the types\nof policy initiatives that you may be interested in pursuing, as these will\nhelp guide both the data that we request and the analyses that we pursue.\n\n",

      "full_text": " A Zoning Petition Has been received from Cambridge Redevelopment Authority regarding a Zoning Ordinance to reflect the proposed changes to the KSURP. Petition Language: To amend Article 14 of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance\n\nMIXED USE DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT: KENDALL CENTER\n\nIntroduction:\n\nWhen Eversource announced its plans for a new electrical substation on\nFulkerson Street, the City Manager asked City and CRA staff, as well as\nrepresentatives from the local development community, to explore an\nalternative site for the facility. After the numerous hearings held by City\nCouncil regarding the substation proposal, Boston Properties (BXP) approached\nthe City and CRA about the idea of placing the substation on the site of the\nexisting \u201cBlue Garage\u201d within the MXD District of the Kendall Square Urban\nRenewal Project Area. Although this alternate site is highly preferred to the\nFulkerson Street location, there are nonetheless many complex technical\nchallenges associated with relocating the substation to this parcel. It\ninvolves not only the design of the substation and high voltage access routes\nto the location, but also completing plans for the housing program currently\noutlined in the Infill Development Concept Plan, fulfilling interim and future\nparking requirements, and designing locations for additional development to\nprovide financial support for this alternative location.\n\nThe CRA hereby submits this zoning petition to amend the Article 14 of the\nCambridge Zoning Ordinance: MXD Development District: Kendall Center in order\nto accommodate the relocation of the Eversource substation to the BXP site.\nCorresponding changes will also be required to the Kendall Square Urban\nRenewal Plan. These changes would affirm the regional utility infrastructure\nland use in the district, as well as provide for additional development rights\nand make adjustments to some dimensional restrictions to facilitate the\nalternative site.\n\n1. Replace the current Subsection 14.21.7(6) with the following text:\n\n14.21.7(6) Transformer station, substation, gas regulator station, or pumping\nstation and related utility uses.\n\n2. Replace first three paragraphs of current Subsection 14.32.1 with the text below: \n\n14.32.1 The Aggregate gross floor area (GFA) of development in the District\nshall not exceed the sum of (i) four million, four hundred seventy three\nthousand (4,473,000) square feet, plus (ii) six hundred thousand (600,000)\nsquare feet that shall be limited to multi-family residential uses as\npermitted in Section 14.21.4(1), for a total Aggregate GFA not to exceed five\nmillion, seventy three thousand (5,073,000) square feet. Up to sixty thousand\n(60,000) square feet of such Aggregate GFA of four million, four hundred\nseventy-three thousand (4,473,000) in clause (i) of the preceding sentence,\nshall be allowable only by special permit pursuant to Section 14.72.\n\nAt least two hundred thousand (200,000) square feet of the GFA restricted to\nhousing uses shall occur only within the area designated on the Zoning Map as\nthe \u201cAmes Street District\u201d and has been approved by special permit dated March\n27,2015 (the \u201cAmes Street Residential Project\u201d).\n\nAdditionally, a building permit for construction of a residential project of\nat least four hundred thousand (400,000) square feet shall be issued prior to\nor concurrently with the issuance of a building permit for any project\nutilizing Utility Project GFA (as defined in Section 14.32.2 below). The\ndesign review process for a residential project of at least four hundred\nthousand (400,000) square feet shall also precede, or proceed concurrently\nwith, the design review process for any project utilizing Utility Project GFA,\nin accordance with a special permit approving a Concept Plan as set forth in\nSection 14.32.2 below.\n\n3\\. Add the following paragraph to the end of Subsection 14.32.2:\n\nAny additional Infill GFA for commercial uses that is not the subject of the\nexisting Concept Plan approved by Special Permit PB #315 on March 20, 2017 (as\namended by Amendment #1 (Major) dated January 31, 2019) (collectively, the\n\u201cExisting Concept Plan\u201d) may only be utilized in conjunction with the\ndevelopment by NSTAR Electric Company d/b/a Eversource (or its successors and\nassigns) of a substation within the District (\u201cthe Substation Project\u201d) and\nonly on property within the District owned by the entity (or an affiliate\nthereof) that provided the land on which the Substation Project is to be\ndeveloped. For the purposes of this Article, the eight hundred thousand\n(800,000) square feet of Infill GFA for commercial uses that is not the\nsubject of the Existing Concept Plan may sometimes be referred to as \u201cUtility\nProject GFA\u201d. The issuance of a building permit for the Substation Project\nshall precede or be issued concurrently with the issuance of a building permit\nfor any project utilizing Utility Project GFA.\n\nThe MXD District is expected to achieve high standards for urban design,\narchitectural design, environmental sustainability and open space design, and\nto transform the area into a recognizable center of activity and civic life\nfor Kendall Square and the surrounding neighborhoods. The District should\ncreate open space to serve residents in the area, as well as workers, students\nfrom nearby institutions, and visitors. It should promote permeability at the\nedges of the District, and create public spaces that will feel welcoming and\ncomfortable for all users.\n\n4. Replace current Subsection 14.32.2.1(8) and 14.32.2.1(9) with the following text:\n\n14.32.2.1 Infill Development Concept Plan Requirements:\n\n8) A plan describing street, public infrastructure, and utility improvements\nto be undertaken in coordination with the development program, including all\nproposed water, stormwater and sewage facilities, and (in conjunction with the\nSubstation Project) the general location of the proposed substation, which\nshall also be submitted to the Department of Public Works for review.\n\n9)  A plan illustrating proposed building scale, height and massing, including\na model and a study demonstrating the anticipated shadow and wind impacts of\nall proposed buildings taller than 100 feet, and a general description of\nproposed mitigation measures that will be employed. Additionally the plan will\ninclude a narrative describing the plan\u2019s compatibility, coordination and\nconsistency with the urban design guidelines set forth in the Kendall Square\nFinal Report of the K2C2 Planning Study (\u201cK2 Guidelines\u201d) the Volpe Working\nGroup\u2019s Planning & Design Principles dated July 20, 2017 (the \u201cVolpe\nGuidelines\u201d) and the planning principles referenced in Section 14.32.2.\n\n5. Replace current Subsection 14.32.2.2 with the following text:\n\n14.32.2.2 Findings and Approval. The Planning Board shall grant a special\npermit approving a Concept Plan upon finding that the new development\nidentified within the plan meets the criteria for approval of a Planned Unit\nDevelopment set forth in Section 12.35.3(3) of the Zoning Ordinance and the\ncriteria for approval of a Project Review Special Permit set forth in Section\n19.25 of the Zoning Ordinance. In making its findings, the Board shall\nconsider the objectives set forth in the K2 Guidelines and the Volpe\nGuidelines. The approval of a Concept Plan shall serve to meet any applicable\nproject review requirements of Article 19.000, and no additional Project\nReview Special Permit shall be required for new development that is identified\nwithin an approved Concept Plan. In addition, while the location of the\nSubstation Project is to be shown on a Concept Plan, the actual development of\nthe Substation Project shall not be included within the scope of a special\npermit approving a Concept Plan (but shall remain subject to all applicable\nregulations governing the construction of such projects).\n\n6. Add the following new Subsection 14.32.5(d) at the end of Subsection 14.32.5:\n\nd) Inapplicability to Utility Project GFA. Notwithstanding the foregoing\nprovisions of this Section 14.32.5. there shall be no Innovation Space\nrequirement for any project utilizing Utility Project GFA (nor shall any such\nproject utilizing Utility Project GFA be entitled to utilize Innovation Space\nin order to obtain a GFA Exemption under Section 14.32.6(3) below).\n\n7\\.  Replace current Subsection 14.32.6(2) and 14.32.6(3) with the following\ntext:\n\n2) Outdoor Area Exemptions: Private outdoor decks or balconies for multi-\nfamily residential or commercial development, up to eight percent (8%) of the\nbuilding floor area.\n\n3) Innovation Space: Innovation Space GFA up to the lesser of either twenty\npercent (20%) of the Infill GFA dedicated to Office and Biotechnology\nManufacturing Uses or one hundred five thousand (105,000) square feet. In\norder for the Innovation Space GFA to be exempt from the Aggregate GFA\nlimitations, at least twenty five percent (25%) of the Innovation Space\nutilization (measured by square footage or shared space membership) must be\nset aside as below market rate space to be offered by the CRA or the City to\nqualifying tenants for short-term leases consistent with Section 14.32.5(b).\n\n8. Add the following new Subsections 14.32.6(7) and 14.32.6(8) at the end of Subsection 14.32.6:\n\n7)  Electrical Substation: The Substation Project shall be exempt from\nAggregate GFA calculation as well as the requirements as to Floor Area Ratio.\nFurther, substation construction shall not constitute Infill GFA (or Utility\nProject GFA).\n\n8) Educational Lab, Classroom or Training Facility: Up to twenty thousand\n(20,000) square feet of educational, health or workforce training facilities\noperated to provide services to the general public (as opposed to private\nfacilities that are solely accessible by tenants or occupants of commercial\nbuildings within the District), which such services are either permitted as of\nright within the District in accordance with the provisions of this Article 14\nor may otherwise be permitted by special permit.\n\n9. Add the following new paragraph at the end of Section 14.33: \n\nNotwithstanding the provisions of the immediately preceding paragraph, there\nshall be no maximum floor area ratio for any project utilizing Infill GFA\n(including Utility Project GFA). However, the District Development Limitations\nin Section 14.32 shall continue to apply.\n\n10. Replace first paragraph of Section 14.34 with the following text: \n\n14.34 Building Height Limitation.\n\nThe maximum building height in the District shall be two hundred and fifty\n(250) feet. Notwithstanding the foregoing, one building within the District\nmay reach four hundred (400) feet provided, however, that the occupied floors\nabove two hundred and fifty feet (250) feet may only contain residential and\nassociated amenity space. Additionally, the floorplate of any portion of a\nbuilding above two hundred fifty (250) feet shall not exceed twelve thousand\nfive hundred (12,500) square feet.\n\n11. Replace current Section 14.38 with the following text:\n\n14.38 Active Ground Floors. The ground floor of newly constructed buildings\nutilizing fifty thousand (50,000) square feet or more of Infill GFA, where\nthat ground floor fronts onto Main Street, Broadway or Ames Street, must be\noccupied by (i) Retail and Consumer Service uses, as listed in Section\n14.21.3, or (ii) active public gathering space (whether enclosed or open),\nalong a minimum length of seventy-five percent (75%) of the building fa\u00e7ade\nalong this frontage; provided, however, that the requirement shall be forty\npercent (40%) for any building with a fa\u00e7ade length of one hundred (100) feet\nor less along such frontage onto Main Street, Broadway or Ames Street.\nDimensional variations and alternate uses may be approved by the Planning\nBoard upon determining that the specific uses and designs proposed are\nconsistent with the purpose and intent of this Section 14.38. Alternatively,\nif a Concept Plan provides for the redevelopment of existing buildings to\ninclude new Retail and Consumer Service uses along the ground floor of any of\nthe identified street frontages, then the Planning Board may permit a\nreduction in the required length of active street frontage for new buildings\nfor up to fifty percent (50%) of the length of new active street frontage\nprovided in existing buildings and only if the Board finds that it results in\na better outcome for the District as a whole. Banks and financial institutions\nshall not be considered active ground floor uses for the purposes of meeting\nthis requirement.\n\n12. Replace current Section 14.39 with the following text:\n\n14.39 Letter of Commitment.\n\nIt is acknowledged and agreed that the Letter of Commitment dated December 21,\n2015 by Boston Properties Limited Partnership is hereby replaced by the Letter\nof Commitment dated January 28, 2021 by the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority.\nAs such, the Letter of Commitment dated December 21, 2015 by Boston Properties\nis declared null and void and of no further force or effect, and shall no\nlonger be binding upon Boston Properties Limited Partnership or its successors\nand assigns.\n\n13. Replace the first paragraph of Subsection 14.52.2 with the following text:\n\n14.52.2 With the exception of multi-family residential development, there are\nno minimum parking requirements for new development in the District.\nResidential development shall provide at a minimum 0.25 automobile parking\nspaces per dwelling unit. All proposed development shall be restricted from\nconstructing parking spaces, either on or off the lot within the District,\nbeyond the maximum allowances of Table 1. If a development includes more than\none category of use, then the number of spaces allowed for the development\nshall be the sum of the allowance for each category of use. Where the\ncomputation of required spaces results in a fractional number, only a fraction\nof one half or more shall be counted as one. The Planning Board may approve\narrangements for shared parking of such residential parking spaces with\ncommercial spaces or otherwise adjust the minimum parking requirements based\non review and analysis of anticipated parking demand within the Transportation\nImpact Study.\n\n14. Replace current Subsection 14.52.3 with the following text:\n\n14.52.3 The parking allowances specified in Table 1 may be satisfied by a\nlease agreement between the developer and the City, other public entity, or\nprivate consortium for use of parking spaces in a public or pooled private\nparking facility located within the District (or, in the case of the spaces\nrequired for residential uses, located outside of the District but within one\nthousand (1,000) feet of the residential building for which the parking is\nbeing provided, measured from property edge to property edge), provided that\non a temporary basis, spaces required for residential uses may be within two\nthousand (2,000) feet of the residential building while permanent residential\nparking is being constructed. The total number of parking spaces leased and\nconstructed within the district for development on a lot shall not exceed the\nmaximum allowances provided for in Table 2.\n\n15. Replace current Subsection 14.52.6 with the following text:\n\n14.52.6 Bicycle Parking: Bike parking shall be provided as set forth in\nSection 6.100 of this Zoning Ordinance; provided that in issuing a special\npermit approving a Concept Plan, the Planning Board may determine that the\nbicycle parking requirements for individual buildings shown on the Concept\nPlan may be met utilizing a campus planning approach toward bicycle parking.\n\n14.52.6.1 Intent: To allow flexibility within the high-density environment of\nthe MXD District while providing high quality, equitable, and thoughtfully\nplanned bicycle parking and sustainable transportation amenities for all\nusers, consistent with Section 6.108.2. Given the complexity of infrastructure\nrequirements of the Substation Project, the bicycle parking provisions set\nforth in Section 6.100 is infeasible, and a comprehensive bicycle parking plan\nwill be needed to help to balance space constraints and competing uses on or\nnear the ground level.\n\n14.52.6.2 Bike Parking Plan: The bicycle parking plan may utilize a\ncombination of the following strategies, or other design provisions that meet\nthe principles of Section 6.108.3:\n\na) Public Bicycle Sharing Facilities: Where a new, standard-size Public\nBicycle Sharing Station or larger is provided (i) on the lot, or (ii) on a\nsite within five hundred (500) feet of the lot, with written approval of the\nCity if located on a public street or other City Property, or otherwise by\nlegally enforceable mutual agreement with the owner of the land on which the\nstation is to be located. If Public Bicycle Sharing Station(s) are provided,\neach bicycle dock within that station may count for up to two (2) required\nbicycle parking spaces.\n\nShould it be deemed beneficial to the operation of a Public Bicycle Sharing\nsystem by the Community Development Department and the Public Bicycle Sharing\nsystem operator, a developer may meet additional bicycle parking requirements\nby providing a secure, accessible and geographically central location for the\nstorage and/or maintenance of the publicly shared bicycles. If a Public\nBicycle Sharing storage and/or maintenance facility is provided, each\ndesignated bicycle storage space shall count for up to one-half (0.5) of a\nrequired bicycle parking space\n\nb) Countercyclical Bicycle Parking Facility: As the District will contain\nresidential and commercial uses having different peak parking demand times,\nmultiple buildings may share parking facilities within three hundred (300)\nfeet from each other. A shared bicycle parking space may count as a required\nbicycle parking space for both a residential use and a commercial use within\nseparate buildings within a campus plan.\n\nc) Complementary Valet Bicycle Parking: Bicycle parking may be provided\nthrough a valet bicycle parking program that is offered free of charge to\nusers. In order to utilize valet bicycle parking, a developer must submit for\nthe Planning Board\u2019s approval a plan describing:\n\ni. The design of the valet bicycle parking facilities (which shall not be\nrequired to conform with the dimensional regulations of Section 6.100).\n\nii. The proposed number of attendants, number of bicycle parking spaces\nprovided, hours of valet service operations, and other pertinent information.\n\nWhen an approved valet bicycle parking program that was utilized to meet the\nrequirements of Section 6.100 is discontinued, the property owner must either\nbring the bicycle parking spaces into full conformance with the bicycle\nparking requirements of Section 6.100 or seek approval from the Planning Board\nfor an alternative approach.\n\nThe combination of the strategies above, or other provisions accepted by the\nPlanning Board, shall allow a project to adjust the minimum required number of\nbicycle parking spaces, as supported through analysis made available to the\nPlanning Board.\n\n",

Morgan, Saundra Graham, and\ncountless others who have helped shape this amazing community; and  \n  \n|  \n  \nWHEREAS:\n\n|\n\nIn 2021, with Kamala Harris having recently made history in becoming the very\nfirst woman, Black, South Asian person to be sworn in as Vice President, a\nbrighter spotlight is shining upon all those, both locally and nationally, who\nhelped pave the way for this tremendous achievement; and  \n  \n|  \n  \nWHEREAS:\n\n|\n\nWhile the people of Cambridge should be delving more deeply into all the parts\nof our history, including the contributions made by African-Americans,\nthroughout the entire year, we should nevertheless make a concerted effort\nduring Black History Month to shine a spotlight on the contributions to our\nshared story that were made by the African-American individuals who walked\nthese paths before us; now therefore be it  \n  \n|  \n  \nRESOLVED:\n\n|\n\nThat the City Council go on record recognizing February 2021 as Black History\nMonth in the City of Cambridge, and that the City Council encourages residents\nacross the community to delve into the many contributions that African-\nAmerican citizens have made in Cambridge since this city\u2019s earliest days.\n\n",

      "full_text": " A communication was received from City Manager Louis A. DePasquale, transmitting a financial analysis of the proposed MXD amendments. Dear Councillor Carlone and Councillor McGovern, Chairs of the Ordinance\nCommittee:\n\nI am pleased to transmit in advance of the Ordinance Committee hearing\nscheduled for Wednesday, January 27, 2021 at 5:30pm, a memo from the\ndevelopment economics consultant team led by Karl F. Seidman and Karp\nStrategies regarding a financial assessment of the MXD Amendments Zoning\nPetition submitted by the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority (CRA). This memo\nis in response to a Policy Order seeking a professional financial assessment\nof added value created for owner/petitioner-led up-zonings for developments of\nmore than 50,000 square feet. It has been reviewed by staff in the Community\nDevelopment Department, Assessing Department, Finance Department, and Budget\nOffice.\n\nThe analysis is an independent estimation of the net increase in project value\nto a developer if the proposed zoning change is adopted, given reasonable\nassumptions and information obtained by the consultant about current market\nconditions and project costs. The net increase in value is compared to the\nestimated cost to the developer of accommodating the construction of an\nelectrical transformer substation on the site.\n\nIt is hard to overstate the importance of this public benefit. This petition\nrepresents the culmination of a complex, multi-party effort led by the City to\nsecure an alternative location for the planned electrical substation at 135\nFulkerson Street. If this proposal succeeds, it will positively impact the\nWellington-Harrington neighborhood, Grand Junction Multi-Use Path, Kennedy\nLongfellow School and John A. Ahern Field while meeting the energy supply\nneeds of the future. It will also enable the City\u2019s acquisition of 135\nFulkerson Street for public use, as part of the commitment by Alexandria Real\nEstate Equities.\n\nIt should be noted that this assessment is an estimate that includes many\nvariables that can change due to external factors and that can significantly\nimpact development values and costs. Moreover, this analysis reflects a\nsnapshot in time, and cannot accurately predict future market conditions or\nperformance. For example, the long-term impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the\noffice and lab market is not fully known or understood at this time. As\ndescribed in the memo, a developer undertaking a project from conception to\ncompletion carries significant risk as market conditions change. If\nunfavorable conditions lead to the project\u2019s costs exceeding its value, the\ndevelopment might not go forward and the associated benefits would not be\nrealized.\n\nI believe the analysis conducted herein demonstrates that the City will\nreceive significant public benefits alongside a balanced increase in\ndevelopment potential to help realize this important project. The Planning\nBoard and Ordinance Committee have both transmitted favorable recommendations\non this petition.\n\nI want to thank Karl Seidman and his team and City staff for their work on\nthis report. I also want to thank the City Council, Eversource, the CRA and\nBoston Properties, Alexandria, and the neighborhood stakeholders who have\nhelped bring the process to this critical point.\n\nSincerely,\n\n![](/Citizens/GetImage.aspx?Type=25&ID=/Aspose.Words.e44d2183-b8c3-42d7-98de-01ef668282fc.001.png)\n\nLouis A.

After the numerous hearings held by City\nCouncil regarding the substation proposal, Boston Properties (BXP) approached\nthe City and CRA about the idea of placing the substation on the site of the\nexisting \u201cBlue Garage\u201d within the MXD District of the Kendall Square Urban\nRenewal Project Area. Although this alternate site is highly preferred to the\nFulkerson Street location, there are nonetheless many complex technical\nchallenges associated with relocating the substation to this parcel. It\ninvolves not only the design of the substation and high voltage access routes\nto the location, but also completing plans for the housing program currently\noutlined in the Infill Development Concept Plan, fulfilling interim and future\nparking requirements, and designing locations for additional development to\nprovide financial support for this alternative location.\n\nThe CRA hereby submits this zoning petition to amend the Article 14 of the\nCambridge Zoning Ordinance: MXD Development District: Kendall Center in order\nto accommodate the relocation of the Eversource substation to the BXP site.\nCorresponding changes will also be required to the Kendall Square Urban\nRenewal Plan. These changes would affirm the regional utility infrastructure\nland use in the district, as well as provide for additional development rights\nand make adjustments to some dimensional restrictions to facilitate the\nalternative site.\n\n1. Replace the current Subsection 14.21.7(6) with the following text:\n\n14.21.7(6) Transformer station, substation, gas regulator station, or pumping\nstation and related utility uses designed primarily to serve development\nwithin the District.\n\n2.

Up to sixty thousand (60,000) square feet of such\nAggregate GFA of three million, six hundred seventy three thousand (3,673,000)\nfour million, four hundred seventy three thousand (4,473,000) in clause (i) of\nthe preceding sentence, shall be allowable only by special permit pursuant to\nSection 14.72.\n\nAt least two hundred thousand (200,000) square feet of the GFA restricted to\nhousing uses shall occur only within the area designated on the Zoning Map as\nthe \u201cAmes Street District\u201d and has been approved by special permit dated March\n27,2015 (the \u201cAmes Street Residential Project\u201d). The commencement of\nconstruction for the Ames Street Residential Project, approved by special\npermit in 2015, shall precede the occupancy of any commercial GFA in excess of\nthree million and seventy-three thousand (3,073,000) square feet, other than\nthe 60,000 square feet of commercial space that may be permitted by special\npermit pursuant to Section 14.72.3.\n\nAdditionally, the commencement of construction of a second residential project\nof at least 200,000 square feet shall precede the occupancy of any commercial\nGFA utilizing Infill GFA (as defined in Section 14.32.2 below) in excess of\nthree hundred and seventy-five thousand (375,000) square feet.\n\nAdditionally, a building permit for construction of a residential project of\nat least four hundred thousand (400,000) square feet shall be issued prior to\nor concurrently with the issuance of a building permit for any project\nutilizing Substation Commercial Utility Project GFA (as defined in Section\n14.32.2 below). The design review process for a residential project of at\nleast four hundred thousand (400,000) square feet shall also precede, or\nproceed concurrently with, the design review process for any project utilizing\nSubstation Commercial Utility Project GFA, in accordance with a special permit\napproving a Concept Plan as set forth in Section 14.32.2 below.\n\n3\\.

The issuance of a building permit\nfor the Substation Project shall precede or be issued concurrently with the\nissuance of a building permit for any project utilizing Substation Commercial\nUtility Project GFA.\n\nThe MXD District is expected to achieve high standards for urban design,\narchitectural design, environmental sustainability and open space design, and\nto transform the area into a recognizable center of activity and civic life\nfor Kendall Square and the surrounding neighborhoods. The District should\ncreate open space to serve residents in the area, as well as workers, students\nfrom nearby institutions, and visitors. It should promote permeability at the\nedges of the District, and create public spaces that will feel welcoming and\ncomfortable for all users.\n\n4.

In making its findings, the Board shall\nconsider the objectives set forth in the Kendall Square Final Report of the\nK2C2 Planning Study (\"K2 Plan\") K2 Guidelines and the Volpe Guidelines and the\nKendall Square Design Guidelines. The approval of a Concept Plan shall serve\nto meet any applicable project review requirements of Article 19.000, and no\nadditional Project Review Special Permit shall be required for new development\nthat is identified within an approved Concept Plan. In addition, while the\nlocation of the Substation Project is to be shown on a Concept Plan, the\nactual development of the Substation Project shall not be included within the\nscope of a special permit approving a Concept Plan (but shall remain subject\nto all applicable regulations governing the construction of such projects).\n\n6. Add the following new Subsection 14.32.5(d) at the end of Subsection 14.32.5:\n\nd) Inapplicability to Substation Commercial Utility Project GFA.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 14.32.5. there shall\nbe no Innovation Space requirement for any project utilizing Substation\nCommercial Utility Project GFA (nor shall any such project utilizing\nSubstation Commercial Utility Project GFA be entitled to utilize Innovation\nSpace in order to obtain a GFA Exemption under Section 14.32.6(3) below).\n\n7\\.

However, the District\nDevelopment Limitations in Section 14.32 shall continue to apply.\n\n10. Replace first paragraph of Section 14.34 with the following text: \n\n14.34 Building Height Limitation.\n\nThe maximum building height in the District shall be two hundred and fifty\n(250) feet, except for the area of the District more than four hundred and\nfifty (450) feet north of the centerline of Broadway, where the maximum\nbuilding height for any portion of a building in such area shall be two\nhundred (200) feet. Up to two (2) mixed-use buildings may reach three hundred\nand fifty (350) feet provided, however, that the occupied floors above two\nhundred and fifty (250) feet may only contain residential and associated\namenity space. Additionally, the floorplate of any portion of a building above\ntwo hundred and fifty (250) feet shall not exceed twelve thousand (12,000)\nsquare feet.\n\nThe maximum building height in the District shall be two hundred and fifty\n(250) feet.

Replace current Section 14.39 with the following text:\n\n14.39 Letter of Commitment.\n\nThe Letter of Commitment dated December 21, 2015 by Boston Properties Limited\nPartnership is incorporated herein by reference and shall be binding upon\nBoston Properties Limited Partnership and its successor and assigns.\n\nIt is acknowledged and agreed that the Letter of Commitment dated December 21,\n2015 by Boston Properties Limited Partnership is hereby replaced by the Letter\nof Commitment dated January xx, 2021 by the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority.\nAs such, the Letter of Commitment dated December 21, 2015 by Boston Properties\nis declared null and void and of no further force or effect, and shall no\nlonger be binding upon Boston Properties Limited Partnership or its successors\nand assigns.\n\n13. Replace the first paragraph of Subsection 14.52.2 with the following text:\n\n14.52.2 With the exception of multi-family residential development, there are\nno minimum parking requirements for new development in the District.\nResidential development shall provide at a minimum 0.4 0.25 automobile parking\nspaces per dwelling unit. All proposed development shall be restricted from\nconstructing parking spaces, either on or off the lot within the District,\nbeyond the maximum allowances of Table 1. If a development includes more than\none category of use, then the number of spaces allowed for the development\nshall be the sum of the allowance for each category of use. Where the\ncomputation of required spaces results in a fractional number, only a fraction\nof one half or more shall be counted as one. The Planning Board may approve\narrangements for shared parking of such residential parking spaces with\ncommercial spaces or otherwise adjust the minimum parking requirements based\non review and analysis of anticipated parking demand within the Transportation\nImpact Study.\n\n14. Replace current Subsection 14.52.3 with the following text:\n\n14.52.3 The parking allowances specified in Table 1 may be satisfied by a\nlease agreement between the developer and the City, other public entity, or\nprivate consortium for use of parking spaces in a public or pooled private\nparking facility located within the District (or, in the case of the spaces\nrequired for residential uses, located outside of the District but within one\nthousand (1,000) two thousand (2,000) feet of the residential building for\nwhich the parking is being provided, measured from property edge to property\nedge), provided that on a temporary basis, spaces required for residential\nuses may be within two thousand (2,000) feet of the residential building while\npermanent residential parking is being constructed. The total number of\nparking spaces leased and constructed within the district for development on a\nlot shall not exceed the maximum allowances provided for in Table 2.\n\n15. Replace current Subsection 14.52.6 with the following text:\n\n14.52.6 Bicycle Parking: Bike parking shall be provided as set forth in\nSection 6.100 of this Zoning Ordinance; provided that in issuing a special\npermit approving a Concept Plan, the Planning Board may determine that the\nbicycle parking requirements for individual buildings shown on the Concept\nPlan may be met utilizing a campus planning approach toward bicycle parking.\n\n14.52.6.1 Intent: To allow flexibility within the high-density environment of\nthe MXD District while providing high quality, equitable, and thoughtfully\nplanned bicycle parking and sustainable transportation amenities for all\nusers, consistent with Section 6.108.2. Given the complexity of infrastructure\nrequirements of the Substation Project, the bicycle parking provisions set\nforth in Section 6.100 is infeasible, and a comprehensive bicycle parking plan\nwill be needed to help to balance space constraints and competing uses on or\nnear the ground level.\n\n14.52.6.2 Bike Parking Plan: The bicycle parking plan may utilize a\ncombination of the following strategies, or other design provisions that meet\nthe principles of Section 6.108.3:\n\na) Public Bicycle Sharing Facilities: Where a new, standard-size Public\nBicycle Sharing Station or larger is provided (i) on the lot, or (ii) on a\nsite within five hundred (500) feet of the lot, with written approval of the\nCity if located on a public street or other City Property, or otherwise by\nlegally enforceable mutual agreement with the owner of the land on which the\nstation is to be located. If Public Bicycle Sharing Station(s) are provided,\neach bicycle dock within that station may count for up to two (2) required\nbicycle parking spaces.\n\nShould it be deemed beneficial to the operation of a Public Bicycle Sharing\nsystem by the Community Development Department and the Public Bicycle Sharing\nsystem operator, a developer may meet additional bicycle parking requirements\nby providing a secure, accessible and geographically central location for the\nstorage and/or maintenance of the publicly shared bicycles. If a Public\nBicycle Sharing storage and/or maintenance facility is provided, each\ndesignated bicycle storage space shall count for up to one-half (0.5) of a\nrequired bicycle parking space\n\nb) Countercyclical Bicycle Parking Facility: As the District will contain\nresidential and commercial uses having different peak parking demand times,\nmultiple buildings may share parking facilities within three hundred (300)\nfeet from each other. A shared bicycle parking space may count as a required\nbicycle parking space for both a residential use and a commercial use within\nseparate buildings within a campus plan.\n\nc) Complementary Valet Bicycle Parking: Bicycle parking may be provided\nthrough a valet bicycle parking program that is offered free of charge to\nusers. In order to utilize valet bicycle parking, a developer must submit for\nthe Planning Board\u2019s approval a plan describing:\n\ni. The design of the valet bicycle parking facilities (which shall not be\nrequired to conform with the dimensional regulations of Section 6.100).\n\nii. The proposed number of attendants, number of bicycle parking spaces\nprovided, hours of valet service operations, and other pertinent information.\n\nWhen an approved valet bicycle parking program that was utilized to meet the\nrequirements of Section 6.100 is discontinued, the property owner must either\nbring the bicycle parking spaces into full conformance with the bicycle\nparking requirements of Section 6.100 or seek approval from the Planning Board\nfor an alternative approach.\n\nThe combination of the strategies above, or other provisions accepted by the\nPlanning Board, shall allow a project to adjust the minimum required number of\nbicycle parking spaces, as supported through analysis made available to the\nPlanning Board.\n\n",

Petition Language: To amend Article 14 of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance\n\nMIXED USE DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT: KENDALL CENTER\n\nIntroduction:\n\nWhen Eversource announced its plans for a new electrical substation on\nFulkerson Street, the City Manager asked City and CRA staff, as well as\nrepresentatives from the local development community, to explore an\nalternative site for the facility. After the numerous hearings held by City\nCouncil regarding the substation proposal, Boston Properties (BXP) approached\nthe City and CRA about the idea of placing the substation on the site of the\nexisting \u201cBlue Garage\u201d within the MXD District of the Kendall Square Urban\nRenewal Project Area. Although this alternate site is highly preferred to the\nFulkerson Street location, there are nonetheless many complex technical\nchallenges associated with relocating the substation to this parcel. It\ninvolves not only the design of the substation and high voltage access routes\nto the location, but also completing plans for the housing program currently\noutlined in the Infill Development Concept Plan, fulfilling interim and future\nparking requirements, and designing locations for additional development to\nprovide financial support for this alternative location.\n\nThe CRA hereby submits this zoning petition to amend the Article 14 of the\nCambridge Zoning Ordinance: MXD Development District: Kendall Center in order\nto accommodate the relocation of the Eversource substation to the BXP site.\nCorresponding changes will also be required to the Kendall Square Urban\nRenewal Plan. These changes would affirm the regional utility infrastructure\nland use in the district, as well as provide for additional development rights\nand make adjustments to some dimensional restrictions to facilitate the\nalternative site.\n\n1. Replace the current Subsection 14.21.7(6) with the following text:\n\n14.21.7(6) Transformer station, substation, gas regulator station, or pumping\nstation and related utility uses.\n\n2.

Up to sixty thousand\n(60,000) square feet of such Aggregate GFA of four million, four hundred\nseventy-three thousand (4,473,000) in clause (i) of the preceding sentence,\nshall be allowable only by special permit pursuant to Section 14.72.\n\nAt least two hundred thousand (200,000) square feet of the GFA restricted to\nhousing uses shall occur only within the area designated on the Zoning Map as\nthe \u201cAmes Street District\u201d and has been approved by special permit dated March\n27,2015 (the \u201cAmes Street Residential Project\u201d).\n\nAdditionally, a building permit for construction of a residential project of\nat least four hundred thousand (400,000) square feet shall be issued prior to\nor concurrently with the issuance of a building permit for any project\nutilizing Utility Project GFA (as defined in Section 14.32.2 below). The\ndesign review process for a residential project of at least four hundred\nthousand (400,000) square feet shall also precede, or proceed concurrently\nwith, the design review process for any project utilizing Utility Project GFA,\nin accordance with a special permit approving a Concept Plan as set forth in\nSection 14.32.2 below.\n\n3\\. Add the following paragraph to the end of Subsection 14.32.2:\n\nAny additional Infill GFA for commercial uses that is not the subject of the\nexisting Concept Plan approved by Special Permit PB #315 on March 20, 2017 (as\namended by Amendment #1 (Major) dated January 31, 2019) (collectively, the\n\u201cExisting Concept Plan\u201d) may only be utilized in conjunction with the\ndevelopment by NSTAR Electric Company d/b/a Eversource (or its successors and\nassigns) of a substation within the District (\u201cthe Substation Project\u201d) and\nonly on property within the District owned by the entity (or an affiliate\nthereof) that provided the land on which the Substation Project is to be\ndeveloped. For the purposes of this Article, the eight hundred thousand\n(800,000) square feet of Infill GFA for commercial uses that is not the\nsubject of the Existing Concept Plan may sometimes be referred to as \u201cUtility\nProject GFA\u201d. The issuance of a building permit for the Substation Project\nshall precede or be issued concurrently with the issuance of a building permit\nfor any project utilizing Utility Project GFA.\n\nThe MXD District is expected to achieve high standards for urban design,\narchitectural design, environmental sustainability and open space design, and\nto transform the area into a recognizable center of activity and civic life\nfor Kendall Square and the surrounding neighborhoods. The District should\ncreate open space to serve residents in the area, as well as workers, students\nfrom nearby institutions, and visitors. It should promote permeability at the\nedges of the District, and create public spaces that will feel welcoming and\ncomfortable for all users.\n\n4.

Additionally the plan will\ninclude a narrative describing the plan\u2019s compatibility, coordination and\nconsistency with the urban design guidelines set forth in the Kendall Square\nFinal Report of the K2C2 Planning Study (\u201cK2 Guidelines\u201d) the Volpe Working\nGroup\u2019s Planning & Design Principles dated July 20, 2017 (the \u201cVolpe\nGuidelines\u201d) and the planning principles referenced in Section 14.32.2.\n\n5. Replace current Subsection 14.32.2.2 with the following text:\n\n14.32.2.2 Findings and Approval. The Planning Board shall grant a special\npermit approving a Concept Plan upon finding that the new development\nidentified within the plan meets the criteria for approval of a Planned Unit\nDevelopment set forth in Section 12.35.3(3) of the Zoning Ordinance and the\ncriteria for approval of a Project Review Special Permit set forth in Section\n19.25 of the Zoning Ordinance. In making its findings, the Board shall\nconsider the objectives set forth in the K2 Guidelines and the Volpe\nGuidelines. The approval of a Concept Plan shall serve to meet any applicable\nproject review requirements of Article 19.000, and no additional Project\nReview Special Permit shall be required for new development that is identified\nwithin an approved Concept Plan.

Here is his summary of the grade level plans:\n\n\u00b7 Preschool - Grades 3: We will continue the current model, using criteria to\nprioritize students for in-person learning seats, four days per week. The\nshift to 3-foot distancing will allow us to combine many currently split in-\nperson classrooms, distribute support staff to support additional learners\nacross the school, and possibly support more 2 - 3 grade students in-person.\n\n\u00b7 Grades 4 - 5: CPS will use the criteria to prioritize students for in-person\nlearning seats, four days per week. Each school will implement this approach\ndifferently, depending on the staffing and enrollment scenario at each school.\nThis may mean students may participate in mixed classrooms, where educators\nare supporting both in-person and remote learners or may be assigned to a new\nteacher and classroom.\n\n\u00b7 Grades 6 - 8: Students will be assigned to two cohorts, which will attend\nschool in-person either Monday/Tuesday or Thursday/Friday. In the case of\ncapacity limits due to staffing, students will be prioritized using district\nwide criteria. Students will be dismissed at lunch, with grab-and-go meals,\nand remote learning continuing in the afternoon.\n\n\u00b7 Grades 9 - 12, CRLS: In-person slots will be prioritized for Academic Tier 2\n& 3 students (based on course grades) to attend in-person four days per week,\nand if there is additional space, 9th grade students.\n\n\u00b7 Grades 9 - 12, HSEP: HSEP will maintain its current operational model due to\nits success and student/family preferences.\n\n\u00b7 Wednesdays will remain a remote learning day for all students, to enable\nstaff planning and collaboration\n\nFamilies are being sent an enrollment form on Friday, January 8th to specify\ntheir choice for either in-person or remote learning. This form will be due on\nFriday, January 15th. Schools will notify families on Monday, January 25th\nabout their enrollment status and their classroom assignments.\n\nAdditional discussion opportunities about upcoming plans will be announced\nsoon (including school-based staff discussions and family information\nsessions, both districtwide and for individual schools).\n\nThe state has extended the deadline for students to receive their required flu\nvaccine (unless there is a religious or medical exemption provided) to\nFebruary 28th, 2021. CPS students between the ages of 12-22 can receive a flu\nshot at the Teen Health Center.\n\nOur upcoming meetings are as follows:\n\n\u00b7 Tuesday, January 12th, 2021\n\no Curriculum & Achievement Subcommittee Meeting | 5:30 PM\n\n\u00a7 To discuss the successes, challenges, learnings, opportunities and needs of\nremote learning in CPSD this spring, looking ahead to the fall semester\n\no Special Meeting | 7:00 PM\n\n\u00a7 To discuss the Superintendent\u2019s proposed plan for expanding in-person\nlearning in February\n\n\u00b7 Tuesday, January 19th, 2021\n\no Regular Meeting | 6:00 PM\n\n\u00b7 Tuesday, February 2nd, 2021\n\no Regular Meeting | 6:00 PM\n\nPlease do not hesitate to reach out with any questions, suggestions, or\nconcerns.\n\n![](/Citizens/GetImage.aspx?Type=25&ID=/Aspose.Words.0f507de5-408e-4027-b23b-1560c6339da3.002.png)\n\nRespectfully,\n\nSumbul Siddiqui\n\n",

      "full_text": " A Zoning Petition Has been received from Cambridge Redevelopment Authority regarding a Zoning Ordinance to reflect the proposed changes to the KSURP. Petition Language: To amend Article 14 of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance\n\nMIXED USE DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT: KENDALL CENTER\n\nIntroduction:\n\nWhen Eversource announced its plans for a new electrical substation on\nFulkerson Street, the City Manager asked City and CRA staff, as well as\nrepresentatives from the local development community, to explore an\nalternative site for the facility. After the numerous hearings held by City\nCouncil regarding the substation proposal, Boston Properties (BXP) approached\nthe City and CRA about the idea of placing the substation on the site of the\nexisting \u201cBlue Garage\u201d within the MXD District of the Kendall Square Urban\nRenewal Project Area. Although this alternate site is highly preferred to the\nFulkerson Street location, there are nonetheless many complex technical\nchallenges associated with relocating the substation to this parcel. It\ninvolves not only the design of the substation and high voltage access routes\nto the location, but also completing plans for the housing program currently\noutlined in the Infill Development Concept Plan, fulfilling interim and future\nparking requirements, and designing locations for additional development to\nprovide financial support for this alternative location.\n\nThe CRA hereby submits this zoning petition to amend the Article 14 of the\nCambridge Zoning Ordinance: MXD Development District: Kendall Center in order\nto accommodate the relocation of the Eversource substation to the BXP site.\nCorresponding changes will also be required to the Kendall Square Urban\nRenewal Plan. These changes would affirm the regional utility infrastructure\nland use in the district, as well as provide for additional development rights\nand make adjustments to some dimensional restrictions to facilitate the\nalternative site.\n\n1. Replace the current Subsection 14.21.7(6) with the following text:\n\n14.21.7(6) Transformer station, substation, gas regulator station, or pumping\nstation and related utility uses.\n\n2. Replace first three paragraphs of current Subsection 14.32.1 with the text below: \n\n14.32.1 The Aggregate gross floor area (GFA) of development in the District\nshall not exceed the sum of (i) four million, four hundred seventy three\nthousand (4,473,000) square feet, plus (ii) six hundred thousand (600,000)\nsquare feet that shall be limited to multi-family residential uses as\npermitted in Section 14.21.4(1), for a total Aggregate GFA not to exceed five\nmillion, seventy three thousand (5,073,000) square feet. Up to sixty thousand\n(60,000) square feet of such Aggregate GFA of four million, four hundred\nseventy-three thousand (4,473,000) in clause (i) of the preceding sentence,\nshall be allowable only by special permit pursuant to Section 14.72.\n\nAt least two hundred thousand (200,000) square feet of the GFA restricted to\nhousing uses shall occur only within the area designated on the Zoning Map as\nthe \u201cAmes Street District\u201d and has been approved by special permit dated March\n27,2015 (the \u201cAmes Street Residential Project\u201d).\n\nAdditionally, a building permit for construction of a residential project of\nat least four hundred thousand (400,000) square feet shall be issued prior to\nor concurrently with the issuance of a building permit for any project\nutilizing Utility Project GFA (as defined in Section 14.32.2 below). The\ndesign review process for a residential project of at least four hundred\nthousand (400,000) square feet shall also precede, or proceed concurrently\nwith, the design review process for any project utilizing Utility Project GFA,\nin accordance with a special permit approving a Concept Plan as set forth in\nSection 14.32.2 below.\n\n3\\. Add the following paragraph to the end of Subsection 14.32.2:\n\nAny additional Infill GFA for commercial uses that is not the subject of the\nexisting Concept Plan approved by Special Permit PB #315 on March 20, 2017 (as\namended by Amendment #1 (Major) dated January 31, 2019) (collectively, the\n\u201cExisting Concept Plan\u201d) may only be utilized in conjunction with the\ndevelopment by NSTAR Electric Company d/b/a Eversource (or its successors and\nassigns) of a substation within the District (\u201cthe Substation Project\u201d) and\nonly on property within the District owned by the entity (or an affiliate\nthereof) that provided the land on which the Substation Project is to be\ndeveloped. For the purposes of this Article, the eight hundred thousand\n(800,000) square feet of Infill GFA for commercial uses that is not the\nsubject of the Existing Concept Plan may sometimes be referred to as \u201cUtility\nProject GFA\u201d. The issuance of a building permit for the Substation Project\nshall precede or be issued concurrently with the issuance of a building permit\nfor any project utilizing Utility Project GFA.\n\nThe MXD District is expected to achieve high standards for urban design,\narchitectural design, environmental sustainability and open space design, and\nto transform the area into a recognizable center of activity and civic life\nfor Kendall Square and the surrounding neighborhoods. The District should\ncreate open space to serve residents in the area, as well as workers, students\nfrom nearby institutions, and visitors. It should promote permeability at the\nedges of the District, and create public spaces that will feel welcoming and\ncomfortable for all users.\n\n4.

Additionally the plan will\ninclude a narrative describing the plan\u2019s compatibility, coordination and\nconsistency with the urban design guidelines set forth in the Kendall Square\nFinal Report of the K2C2 Planning Study (\u201cK2 Guidelines\u201d) the Volpe Working\nGroup\u2019s Planning & Design Principles dated July 20, 2017 (the \u201cVolpe\nGuidelines\u201d) and the planning principles referenced in Section 14.32.2.\n\n5. Replace current Subsection 14.32.2.2 with the following text:\n\n14.32.2.2 Findings and Approval. The Planning Board shall grant a special\npermit approving a Concept Plan upon finding that the new development\nidentified within the plan meets the criteria for approval of a Planned Unit\nDevelopment set forth in Section 12.35.3(3) of the Zoning Ordinance and the\ncriteria for approval of a Project Review Special Permit set forth in Section\n19.25 of the Zoning Ordinance. In making its findings, the Board shall\nconsider the objectives set forth in the K2 Guidelines and the Volpe\nGuidelines. The approval of a Concept Plan shall serve to meet any applicable\nproject review requirements of Article 19.000, and no additional Project\nReview Special Permit shall be required for new development that is identified\nwithin an approved Concept Plan. In addition, while the location of the\nSubstation Project is to be shown on a Concept Plan, the actual development of\nthe Substation Project shall not be included within the scope of a special\npermit approving a Concept Plan (but shall remain subject to all applicable\nregulations governing the construction of such projects).\n\n6. Add the following new Subsection 14.32.5(d) at the end of Subsection 14.32.5:\n\nd) Inapplicability to Utility Project GFA. Notwithstanding the foregoing\nprovisions of this Section 14.32.5. there shall be no Innovation Space\nrequirement for any project utilizing Utility Project GFA (nor shall any such\nproject utilizing Utility Project GFA be entitled to utilize Innovation Space\nin order to obtain a GFA Exemption under Section 14.32.6(3) below).\n\n7\\.  Replace current Subsection 14.32.6(2) and 14.32.6(3) with the following\ntext:\n\n2) Outdoor Area Exemptions: Private outdoor decks or balconies for multi-\nfamily residential or commercial development, up to eight percent (8%) of the\nbuilding floor area.\n\n3) Innovation Space: Innovation Space GFA up to the lesser of either twenty\npercent (20%) of the Infill GFA dedicated to Office and Biotechnology\nManufacturing Uses or one hundred five thousand (105,000) square feet. In\norder for the Innovation Space GFA to be exempt from the Aggregate GFA\nlimitations, at least twenty five percent (25%) of the Innovation Space\nutilization (measured by square footage or shared space membership) must be\nset aside as below market rate space to be offered by the CRA or the City to\nqualifying tenants for short-term leases consistent with Section 14.32.5(b).\n\n8. Add the following new Subsections 14.32.6(7) and 14.32.6(8) at the end of Subsection 14.32.6:\n\n7)  Electrical Substation: The Substation Project shall be exempt from\nAggregate GFA calculation as well as the requirements as to Floor Area Ratio.\nFurther, substation construction shall not constitute Infill GFA (or Utility\nProject GFA).\n\n8) Educational Lab, Classroom or Training Facility: Up to twenty thousand\n(20,000) square feet of educational, health or workforce training facilities\noperated to provide services to the general public (as opposed to private\nfacilities that are solely accessible by tenants or occupants of commercial\nbuildings within the District), which such services are either permitted as of\nright within the District in accordance with the provisions of this Article 14\nor may otherwise be permitted by special permit.\n\n9.

Replace first paragraph of Section 14.34 with the following text: \n\n14.34 Building Height Limitation.\n\nThe maximum building height in the District shall be two hundred and fifty\n(250) feet. Notwithstanding the foregoing, one building within the District\nmay reach four hundred (400) feet provided, however, that the occupied floors\nabove two hundred and fifty feet (250) feet may only contain residential and\nassociated amenity space. Additionally, the floorplate of any portion of a\nbuilding above two hundred fifty (250) feet shall not exceed twelve thousand\nfive hundred (12,500) square feet.\n\n11. Replace current Section 14.38 with the following text:\n\n14.38 Active Ground Floors. The ground floor of newly constructed buildings\nutilizing fifty thousand (50,000) square feet or more of Infill GFA, where\nthat ground floor fronts onto Main Street, Broadway or Ames Street, must be\noccupied by (i) Retail and Consumer Service uses, as listed in Section\n14.21.3, or (ii) active public gathering space (whether enclosed or open),\nalong a minimum length of seventy-five percent (75%) of the building fa\u00e7ade\nalong this frontage; provided, however, that the requirement shall be forty\npercent (40%) for any building with a fa\u00e7ade length of one hundred (100) feet\nor less along such frontage onto Main Street, Broadway or Ames Street.\nDimensional variations and alternate uses may be approved by the Planning\nBoard upon determining that the specific uses and designs proposed are\nconsistent with the purpose and intent of this Section 14.38. Alternatively,\nif a Concept Plan provides for the redevelopment of existing buildings to\ninclude new Retail and Consumer Service uses along the ground floor of any of\nthe identified street frontages, then the Planning Board may permit a\nreduction in the required length of active street frontage for new buildings\nfor up to fifty percent (50%) of the length of new active street frontage\nprovided in existing buildings and only if the Board finds that it results in\na better outcome for the District as a whole. Banks and financial institutions\nshall not be considered active ground floor uses for the purposes of meeting\nthis requirement.\n\n12. Replace current Section 14.39 with the following text:\n\n14.39 Letter of Commitment.\n\nIt is acknowledged and agreed that the Letter of Commitment dated December 21,\n2015 by Boston Properties Limited Partnership is hereby replaced by the Letter\nof Commitment dated January 28, 2021 by the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority.\nAs such, the Letter of Commitment dated December 21, 2015 by Boston Properties\nis declared null and void and of no further force or effect, and shall no\nlonger be binding upon Boston Properties Limited Partnership or its successors\nand assigns.\n\n13.

All proposed development shall be restricted from\nconstructing parking spaces, either on or off the lot within the District,\nbeyond the maximum allowances of Table 1. If a development includes more than\none category of use, then the number of spaces allowed for the development\nshall be the sum of the allowance for each category of use. Where the\ncomputation of required spaces results in a fractional number, only a fraction\nof one half or more shall be counted as one. The Planning Board may approve\narrangements for shared parking of such residential parking spaces with\ncommercial spaces or otherwise adjust the minimum parking requirements based\non review and analysis of anticipated parking demand within the Transportation\nImpact Study.\n\n14. Replace current Subsection 14.52.3 with the following text:\n\n14.52.3 The parking allowances specified in Table 1 may be satisfied by a\nlease agreement between the developer and the City, other public entity, or\nprivate consortium for use of parking spaces in a public or pooled private\nparking facility located within the District (or, in the case of the spaces\nrequired for residential uses, located outside of the District but within one\nthousand (1,000) feet of the residential building for which the parking is\nbeing provided, measured from property edge to property edge), provided that\non a temporary basis, spaces required for residential uses may be within two\nthousand (2,000) feet of the residential building while permanent residential\nparking is being constructed. The total number of parking spaces leased and\nconstructed within the district for development on a lot shall not exceed the\nmaximum allowances provided for in Table 2.\n\n15. Replace current Subsection 14.52.6 with the following text:\n\n14.52.6 Bicycle Parking: Bike parking shall be provided as set forth in\nSection 6.100 of this Zoning Ordinance; provided that in issuing a special\npermit approving a Concept Plan, the Planning Board may determine that the\nbicycle parking requirements for individual buildings shown on the Concept\nPlan may be met utilizing a campus planning approach toward bicycle parking.\n\n14.52.6.1 Intent: To allow flexibility within the high-density environment of\nthe MXD District while providing high quality, equitable, and thoughtfully\nplanned bicycle parking and sustainable transportation amenities for all\nusers, consistent with Section 6.108.2. Given the complexity of infrastructure\nrequirements of the Substation Project, the bicycle parking provisions set\nforth in Section 6.100 is infeasible, and a comprehensive bicycle parking plan\nwill be needed to help to balance space constraints and competing uses on or\nnear the ground level.\n\n14.52.6.2 Bike Parking Plan: The bicycle parking plan may utilize a\ncombination of the following strategies, or other design provisions that meet\nthe principles of Section 6.108.3:\n\na) Public Bicycle Sharing Facilities: Where a new, standard-size Public\nBicycle Sharing Station or larger is provided (i) on the lot, or (ii) on a\nsite within five hundred (500) feet of the lot, with written approval of the\nCity if located on a public street or other City Property, or otherwise by\nlegally enforceable mutual agreement with the owner of the land on which the\nstation is to be located. If Public Bicycle Sharing Station(s) are provided,\neach bicycle dock within that station may count for up to two (2) required\nbicycle parking spaces.\n\nShould it be deemed beneficial to the operation of a Public Bicycle Sharing\nsystem by the Community Development Department and the Public Bicycle Sharing\nsystem operator, a developer may meet additional bicycle parking requirements\nby providing a secure, accessible and geographically central location for the\nstorage and/or maintenance of the publicly shared bicycles. If a Public\nBicycle Sharing storage and/or maintenance facility is provided, each\ndesignated bicycle storage space shall count for up to one-half (0.5) of a\nrequired bicycle parking space\n\nb) Countercyclical Bicycle Parking Facility: As the District will contain\nresidential and commercial uses having different peak parking demand times,\nmultiple buildings may share parking facilities within three hundred (300)\nfeet from each other. A shared bicycle parking space may count as a required\nbicycle parking space for both a residential use and a commercial use within\nseparate buildings within a campus plan.\n\nc) Complementary Valet Bicycle Parking: Bicycle parking may be provided\nthrough a valet bicycle parking program that is offered free of charge to\nusers. In order to utilize valet bicycle parking, a developer must submit for\nthe Planning Board\u2019s approval a plan describing:\n\ni. The design of the valet bicycle parking facilities (which shall not be\nrequired to conform with the dimensional regulations of Section 6.100).\n\nii. The proposed number of attendants, number of bicycle parking spaces\nprovided, hours of valet service operations, and other pertinent information.\n\nWhen an approved valet bicycle parking program that was utilized to meet the\nrequirements of Section 6.100 is discontinued, the property owner must either\nbring the bicycle parking spaces into full conformance with the bicycle\nparking requirements of Section 6.100 or seek approval from the Planning Board\nfor an alternative approach.\n\nThe combination of the strategies above, or other provisions accepted by the\nPlanning Board, shall allow a project to adjust the minimum required number of\nbicycle parking spaces, as supported through analysis made available to the\nPlanning Board.\n\n",

      "full_text": " A communication transmitted from Louis A. DePasquale, City Manager, relative to the biennial City of Cambridge Resident Telephone Survey for 2020. I am transmitting the results of the biennial City of Cambridge Resident\nTelephone Survey for 2020. I am very pleased to report that overall opinions\nof the City's core attributes remain very favorable, and residents' opinions\nof the City's COVID-19 response are widely regarded as positive.  \n  \nOn perhaps the most all-encompassing measure of resident sentiment,\nsatisfaction with overall experiences with the City is at a record high level\nfor the 20-year history of this survey program. Last year was an incredibly\nchallenging year, and I am extremely proud that during a pandemic, the\npercentage of respondents who are \"totally\" satisfied with their interactions\nwith the City remained at the highest level we have seen over the course of\nthis survey program. Moreover, the combined overall satisfaction rose from 55%\nin 2018 to 60% today. I believe this reflects our highly capable and extremely\ndedicated workforce and the focus they place on the initiatives and priorities\nof the Council. I want to thank City staff for their commitment to our\ncommunity and for their hard work.  \n  \nThis year's survey asked a series of questions regarding the COVID-19\npandemic. Overall, 81% of respondents rated the City's handling of the\npandemic as \"excellent\" or \"good.\" Specific to the City's performance during\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, 79% of respondents rated public information services as\n\"excellent\" or \"good,\" 75% rated public health services as \"excellent\" or\n\"good,\" and 73% of respondents rated the City's online/virtual services as\n\"excellent\" or \"good.\" When asked about COVID-19 testing services, 56% of\nrespondents provided a rating of \"excellent\" or \"good,\" while 19% \u201cdid not\nknow.\u201d Almost three-quarters of survey respondents indicated that they closely\nfollow public health updates and recommendations on COVID-19.  \n  \nFinally, survey respondents indicated they trust the state government the most\nfor public health information (38%), followed by the City and state equally\n(26%), followed by the City government alone (24%), and lastly, the federal\ngovernment (4%). Almost a third of respondents indicated that they experienced\na loss of employment income since mid-March, with job loss twice as high as\nthe norm (64%) among Hispanic residents and significantly higher among\nAfrican-American residents (45%).  \n  \nThe survey serves as a valuable tool to help inform us about issues and areas\nwhere the City is excelling and areas that the City may need to pay particular\nattention to, and where we might focus even more efforts in the future. I am\nproud that areas related to City performance, access to services, and public\ninformation have seen increases.  \n  \nOverall city performance is up since 2018, with fully two-thirds (66%) of\nrespondents giving the City either \"excellent\" or \"good\" rating. The City's\npublic information received an \"excellent\" or \"good\" rating from 83% of\nrespondents. And this year, the fewest residents since the inception of the\nsurvey agreed with a statement that they were unable to conduct business with\nthe City during regular business hours. In 2018, 43% agreed with the\nstatement, and in 2020 just 32% agreed.  \n  \nAmong the 11 City services we explored for performance, excellent ratings\nimproved on: 'street maintenance' (+9) and 'public information' (+3). Several\nservices experienced drops in \"excellent\" ratings from 2018. The largest\ndeclines were: fire department services (-16), schools and education (-15),\nand police department services (-10).\n\nAffordable housing/housing (30%) was again identified as the \"single most\nimportant issue facing the City of Cambridge today.\" Housing affordability\ncontinues to be a significant regional concern, and these results reaffirm the\nCity's strong financial and policy commitment and prioritization of the issue.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic (17%), educations and schools (9%), jobs and economy\n(7%), and climate change issues (5%) round out the top five \"single most\nimportant\" issues identified in the 2020 survey.  \n  \nResidents' ratings of the quality of life in Cambridge have risen since 2018,\nincreasing from an \"excellent\" rating of 39% in 2018 to 42% in 2020, and\n\"Fair\" and \"Poor\" ratings decreased from 12% in 2018 down to 9% in 2020. An\nimpressive 92% give \"excellent\" or \"good\" ratings to Cambridge as \"a place to\nlive,\" and 89% give \"excellent\" or \"good\" ratings to Cambridge as \"a safe\nplace to live.\" Moving forward, we will closely monitor areas that saw\ndecreases in the \"excellent\" ratings, such as: economic development (-12), a\nplace to raise a child (-8), a place welcoming to all races and cultures (-7)\nability to have a positive impact on the community (-7), ability to\nparticipate in government (-6), and environmental planning and policy (-6).  \n  \nThis year's survey also found that the percentage of residents who have ridden\na bike more than 26 times (48%) has gone up 4 points since 2018, and those\nvisiting a park more than 26 times (48%) has gone up 2 points since 2018. The\npercentage of residents who say they have \"never\" attended a City Council\nmeeting (57%) has dropped 7 points since 2018.  \n  \nThe number of people who have visited the City's website more than 26 times\n(15%) has tripled from 2018. The share of residents who say they have \"never\"\nvisited the website (10%) is down 17 points since 2018. The primary method of\nconducting business with the City is now through the website (47%), and in-\nperson interactions are down 15 points, dropping from 32% in 2018 to just 17%\nin 2020.  \n  \nThe survey was conducted September 9 -September 13, 2020. The statistically\nvalid random telephone survey of residents has been conducted every two years\nsince 2000 and was led by Polity Research Consulting. A web version\nsupplemented this year's survey, with 2,551 individual respondents completing\nthe survey. The survey responses provide a snapshot of public sentiment\ntowards various issues and public services in the City. Some variation in the\nresults from survey to survey is expected. In reviewing the survey results, it\nis important to pay attention to any emerging and long-term trends.  \n  \nI hope you will look closely at the report by Polity Research Consulting to\nview all of the changes in the 2020 survey. Also enclosed is a separate\ncompilation of aggregated results for various responses and corresponding\nsurvey results since 2000. Overall, for the 42 questions in this survey with\nhistorical data, 77% of the 2020 aggregated responses (32 questions) are above\nthe historical average for each of the questions (see attached worksheet).  \n  \nI expect to work closely with City departments to further analyze the results\nto incorporate relevant insights into priorities and future work plans, and\nthe overall budget process. I anticipate that the survey results will be a\nvaluable tool for the Council and the public to understand community issues. I\nwelcome a more detailed exploration of the survey results with the Council. I\nam happy to ask a representative from Polity Research Consulting to attend a\ncommittee meeting.\n\n",

Seidman regarding a financial assessment of the Canal District Kendall (PUD-CDK) Zoning Petition submitted by BioMed Realty. I am pleased to transmit a memo from the development economics consultant team\nled by Karl F. Seidman regarding a financial assessment of the Canal District\nKendall (PUD-CDK) Zoning Petition submitted by BioMed Realty. This memo is in\nresponse to a Policy Order seeking a professional financial assessment of\nadded value created for owner/petitioner-led up-zonings for developments of\nmore than 50,000 square feet. It has been reviewed by staff in the Community\nDevelopment Department, Assessing Department, Finance Department, and Budget\nOffice.\n\nThe analysis is an independent estimation of the net increase in project value\nto a developer if the proposed zoning change is adopted, given reasonable\nassumptions and information obtained by the consultant about current market\nconditions and project costs. The net increase in value is compared to the\nvalue of the community benefits proposed by BioMed Realty, which is based on\nthe cost to the developer of providing such benefits.\n\nIt should be noted that this assessment is an estimate that includes many\nvariables that can change due to external factors and that can significantly\nimpact development values and costs. Moreover, this analysis reflects a\nsnapshot in time, and cannot accurately predict future market conditions or\nperformance. For example, the long-term impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the\noffice and lab market is not fully known or understood at this time. As\ndescribed in the memo, a developer undertaking a project from conception to\ncompletion carries significant risk as market conditions change. If\nunfavorable conditions lead to the project\u2019s costs exceeding its value, the\ndevelopment might not go forward and the associated benefits would not be\nrealized.\n\nIn addition to explicit community benefits identified in the zoning and draft\nLetter of Commitment, the proposed development advances our planning goals and\nprovides benefits to the public that cannot be quantified. By creating public\nspace and an arts and culture anchor in the heart of Kendall Square, the\nproposed new building will deliver long-desired community-focused uses\nfurthering Kendall Square\u2019s transformation from a predominantly commercial\ndistrict to a vibrant, mixed-use neighborhood. The proposed relocation of the\nEversource GTS infrastructure away from Third Street will have a\ntransformative effect on the pedestrian environment along Third Street and\nthis part of the City. Development will also result in both temporary and\npermanent jobs within Cambridge, and help to sustain the tax base and overall\neconomic health of the City as a whole.\n\nI believe this analysis, along with the positive recommendations from the\nPlanning Board and Ordinance Committee, demonstrate that this proposal will\nresult in considerable benefits to the City that are balanced with the\nincreased development value to the property owner.\n\nI want to thank Karl Seidman and his team for this work, and everyone who\nprovided input to help bring this report to completion. As the first\npetitioner to be the focus of this type of assessment, I want to thank BioMed\nRealty for being a willing participant. I hope that this analysis provides the\nCity Council with the necessary guidance to make its decision.\n\n",

      "full_text": " A communication transmitted from Louis A. DePasquale, City Manager, relative to the following requests relative to the eminent domain taking of 185 Larch Road:  1.  Appropriate $7,702,000 from Free Cash to the General Fund Law Department Travel & Training (Damages) Account to cover the pro tanto payment toward the expenses of acquisition as required by the above referenced Sections of Chapters 40 and 43 of the General Laws for the property located at 185 Larch Road owned by BB&N;  2.  Approve an Order to take by eminent domain a 185 Larch Road; and 3. Appropriate $10,798,000 from Free Cash to the General Fund Law Department Travel & Training (Damages) Account to fund the settlement of BB&N\u2019s remaining eminent domain damages claim. I am writing to recommend that the City Council approve an Order to take by\neminent domain a parcel of land, consisting of approximately 4 acres, located\nat 185 Larch Road (as shown on Assessors Map 248, Parcel 79), owned by\nBuckingham Browne and Nichols School (BB&N) and known as Buckingham Field that\nis currently used as a playing field by BB&N. Pursuant to Section 30 of\nChapter 43, Section 14 of Chapter 40, and Chapter 79 of the General Laws, all\nas amended, it is provided that the City Council may take in fee in the name\nof the City of Cambridge for any municipal purpose any land within the limits\nof the City not already appropriated for public use.  \n  \nFor several decades the City Council has been asking City Managers to actively\npursue opportunities to acquire and increase access to open space for all\nresidents. Unfortunately, this goal has been very difficult to achieve due to\nthe lack of availability of land suitable for open space use in Cambridge. Due\nto this, when BB&N expressed interest in selling Buckingham Field, we\naggressively pursued this opportunity to acquire additional open space in\nCambridge. Therefore, I am pleased to present this to you and I strongly\nrecommend that the City take advantage of this unique opportunity to acquire\nland currently being used as athletic fields to increase the City\u2019s open\nspace. BB&N is interested in selling Buckingham Field to the City, and has\nexpressed a strong preference for its continued use as open space for future\ngenerations of Cantabrigians, and I recommend using the eminent domain process\nfor what is called a \u201cfriendly taking\u201d as the means to acquire this property\nfrom BB&N.  \n  \nI also recommend that the City Council appropriate funds for the acquisition\nof Buckingham Field, as set forth in detail below.  \n\nBackground  \n  \nBB&N is in the process of acquiring land in Watertown to consolidate its\nathletic playing fields. This transaction is expected to be executed in\nJanuary 2021. BB&N is purchasing approximately 6 acres in Watertown to\nconsolidate its athletic complex and is therefore making Buckingham Field\navailable to the City for purchase. As stated above, the ability to purchase\napproximately 4 acres of open space within the City is a rare opportunity.\nThis property is situated across Fresh Pond Parkway from the Water Treatment\nFacility and Kingsley Park, and is a short distance from the Tobin School\ncomplex.\n\n  \nBuckingham Brown and Nichols has offered to sell this parcel to the City (via\nthe proposed friendly eminent domain taking) at a reduced sales price of $18.5\nmillion which is below what they might expect to receive in a competitive sale\nenvironment. As part of our preliminary conversations about this potential\nsale, BB&N has indicated that it would like to retain the possible use of this\nathletic field for up to 3 years while its new athletic complex is being\ndeveloped. Assuming that BB&N uses the athletic field during this three year\nperiod, BB&N will compensate the City for the continued use, and the\ncompensation to the City would be the following: Year 1 - $0; Year 2 -\n$100,000 and; Year 3 - $200,000, for a total of $300,000. At this time, the\nCity will pay $18.2 million and if BB&N does not use the field, the City will\npay up to the remaining $300,000 of the $18.5 total purchase price. BB&N has\nindicated that the athletic field would be available for use by the City at\nthe conclusion of BB&N\u2019s school year in the months of June, July and August\nfor athletic uses, and for use by the City for School programs as well as\nother mutually agreeable programs at mutually agreeable times during the\nschool year throughout the proposed 3-year option period. The City has agreed\nto work with BB&N to make available for BB&N\u2019s use City playing fields and\ntennis courts if not in use by the City during the transition.  \n  \nExcluding the golf course, there are approximately 265 acres of city-owned\npublic open space in Cambridge, including parks, athletic fields and school\nplaygrounds. The City\u2019s total land area is 6.26 square miles or 4,006 acres.\nDemand for open space in the city continues to be extremely high. This is\nespecially true since Cambridge is one of the most densely populated cities in\nthe country, and estimated population growth City-wide over the past decade\nhas generally outpaced the expansion of public open spaces. Further,\nincreasing the amount of open space in Cambridge is especially challenging\nbecause of an extremely limited amount of undeveloped private land, as well as\ntypically very high costs to acquire land in the City. It is extremely\nimportant to explore, and when feasible act on, every opportunity to add to\nthe City\u2019s open space network, especially during these difficult times as a\nresult of COVID-19.  \n  \nProcess  \n  \nAs noted earlier, BB&N is expecting to close on their new property in\nWatertown in January 2021 and needs the City to complete the eminent domain\nproceeding and pay the proceeds to BB&N prior to the Watertown purchase. If\nthe City chooses to move forward with this purchase, funds need to be\nappropriated, and the purchase and sale of this property must be executed and\ncompleted by early January 2021.  \n  \nThe City intends to acquire this property through what is commonly referred to\nas a \u201cfriendly taking.\u201d A friendly taking describes the use of the statutory\neminent domain procedure to acquire a property that an owner seeks to sell to\nthe City. This property is already being valued below market value because the\nowner is a charitable educational organization that is tax exempt due to the\ncharitable use of the property under Massachusetts Law, so the purchase price\nallowed pursuant to law is substantially lower than fair market value would\nbe. The assessed valued for this property has remained at $6,161,600 for the\npast three plus years. This assessed value does not represent the property\u2019s\ncurrent fair market value as tax exempt properties are only reviewed during\nthe revaluation which occurs once every five years. The true indication of the\ncurrent fair market-rate value of this property has been estimated by a highly\nqualified appraiser retained by the City Solicitor. The appraiser Steven R.\nFoster, MAI of Lincoln Property Company has determined that the fair market\nvalue of the property at its highest and best use, which is characterized as\nresidential use, is $20,000,000. The City\u2019s Director of Assessment Gayle\nWillett has reviewed the Foster appraisal as an additional examination to\nensure that the appraised value represents the current market rate value of\nthe property. The City would pay the amount allowed by law as a pro tanto to\nBB&N. A pro tanto is an initial payment that the property owner can accept\nwithout prejudice to its right to bring a claim for the full amount of damages\nthat it asserts is due. Under the law, the property owner has the right to\nchallenge the amount of the pro tanto payment in a legal proceeding and could\nseek to persuade a court that it is entitled to the current fair market value\nof the property. The eminent domain procedure allows the City to exceed the\nlimits that G.L. c.40, \u00a714 and G.L. c.43, \u00a730 impose on the purchase price of\na property (which limit the purchase price that the City may pay to the\naverage of the three prior years\u2019 assessed value plus a 25% increase) after an\nowner of land taken by eminent domain has sought damages for the remainder of\nthe fair market value or purchase price of the property.  \n  \nThe City intends, subject to the City Council\u2019s approval, to pay the remainder\nof the purchase price of $18,500,000 through settlement of an eminent domain\ndamages claim-this is why this type of transaction is referred to as a\n\u201cfriendly taking.\u201d I will initiate a settlement of any such claim with the\nproperty owner if the City Council votes to approve the appropriation of the\npro tanto, authorizes the taking of this property by eminent domain, and\nappropriates funds to settle the damages claim.  \n  \nAs an overview, some of the steps in this process to satisfy legal\nrequirements include:  \n\n1. The City has retained an appraiser, Steven R. Foster, MAI of Lincoln Property Company, who performed and evaluated a required independent appraisal of the property;\n\n2. The City has received a First American Title Insurance Company Title Commitment issued by one of the company\u2019s agents, the law firm of Marsh, Moriarty, Ontell & Golder, P.C., who performed a full title examination of the property;\n\n3.

Statement of Goals and Guidelines and Standards for Review\n\nThe Goal of the District and of this Order is to protect the Harvard Square\nConservation District\u2019s distinctive physical and experiential characteristics\nand to enhance the livability and vital- ity of the District. The Historical\nCommission should seek to enhance the unique physical environment and visual\nform of the District; preserve its architecturally and historically\nsignificant structures and their settings; encourage creative design that\ncontributes to the richness of its environment; mitigate character-diminishing\nimpacts of new development; and discourage homogeneity by encouraging\ndiversity of development and open space patterns and building scales and ages.\nThe District must remain a pedestrian-friendly, accessible, human-scale,\nquirky, mixed-use environment that supports dynamic urban experiences,\ncomplements nearby neighborhoods, and respects the history and traditions of\nits location.\n\nThe following Secondary Goals for the District are intended to provide general\nguidance in a wide variety of situations, and are not intended to be applied\nto every project. They are statements of policy, not prescriptive measures\nthat must be applied equally in each situation.\n\n1. Significant Buildings. Preserve historically or architecturally significant buildings and structures as well as those that contribute to the distinctive visual character or historical significance of the District.\n\n2. Sustain the vitality of the commercial environment. Sustain the vitality of the commercial environment while preserving architecturally-significant or original building fabric at street level and above. Encourage the restoration of missing features where these have been documented. Except for protected storefronts, encourage creative contemporary commercial design inside the restored framework of storefront openings. Encourage creative signage. Support below-grade commercial spaces where appropriate. Regardless of use, encourage architectural solutions that preserve storefront fabric, transparency, and utility.\n\n3. Contemporary Design. Where context allows, support creative, contemporary design for new construction that complements the context of abutting buildings and enhances the character of the subdistrict. Recognize and respect well-reasoned contemporary design during the review process. Support innovative approaches to enhancing the unique character of Harvard Square while mitigating the detrimental impacts of development on proximate areas.\n\n4. Diversity of Form. Build on and sustain the diversity of existing building form, scale and material. Preserve and encourage appropriate green spaces, scale-appropriate open spaces, and new buildings that support the prevailing character of the subdistrict. Pre- serve the remaining wood frame buildings throughout the District. Maintain a consistent setback or streetwall condition where that character has been set. Support small-scale storefronts to preserve the vitality and character of the streetscape.\n\n5. Public Environment. Create a high-quality public environment in the District with compatible materials, lighting, signage, and street furniture such as bollards, benches, move- able seating, and the like. Provide adequate facilities for trash and recycling and surfaces that can be cleaned and maintained. Encourage planted greenspaces and accommodate trees where possible.\n\n6. Pedestrian Experience. Protect and enhance the pedestrian experience. Expand the net- work of pedestrian walkways and paths wherever they can conveniently provide alternate routes through the District. Increase public access to alleys and interior spaces where appropriate and upgrade the paving and landscaping of such spaces. Enhance accessibility and safety for pedestrians throughout the District.\n\n7. Residential Development. Enhance the all-hours neighborhood quality of Harvard Square by supporting existing residential uses and encouraging additional residential units in mixed-use buildings.\n\n8. Compatible Design. Encourage compatible design that supports a wide diversity of uses serving the needs of surrounding neighborhoods, students, workers and visitors from around the world.\n\n9. Transportation. Encourage creative solutions to the District\u2019s transportation issues by providing balanced accommodations for through and local traffic, cyclists, and pedestri- ans. Promote smooth movement of traffic on through streets and seek creative design and management solutions for side streets where traffic volume and speeds can be regulated to give highest priority to pedestrians. Provide adequate bicycle parking throughout the District. Protect pedestrian safety and experience through careful design and place- ment of features such as loading docks, curb cuts, and receptacles for trash and recy- cling. Encourage replacement of surface parking lots with compatible new structures. Discourage provision of on-site parking for new construction.\n\n10. Environmental Sustainability. Encourage environmentally sustainable development that takes into consideration the embodied energy of the existing built environment, material life cycles, passive design, energy conservation, and current standards for best energy conservation practices. Alterations to existing buildings that seek to promote energy conservation should be accomplished in a manner that respects character-defining mate- rials and designs.\n\n11. Architectural lighting. Architectural (building fa\u00e7ade) lighting, streetscape lighting, and signage lighting, when allowed by a Certificate of Appropriateness, should reinforce definitive characteristics of historic and contemporary architecture as well as create high quality 24-hour streetscapes. To achieve these goals, projects should minimize bright- ness, and light trespass, monitor light color (temperature Kelvin), and focus lighting on significant features.\n\nThe foregoing goals also recite the standards for preservation and change\nwithin the District. In addition to the factors specified in Section 2.78.220,\nand subject to any specific provisions of this Order, in exercising its\nauthority with respect to the District and in considering applications for\ncertificates of appropriateness, hardship, or nonapplicability, the Historical\nCommission shall be guided by the preceding general goal for the District as a\nwhole and by such of the pre- ceding secondary goals as it determines to be\napplicable to the project or situation before it.\n\nThe Historical Commission shall also be guided by the standards and guidelines\ndescribed in the \u201cFinal Report of the Harvard Square Neighborhood Conservation\nDistrict Study Committee,\u201d dated November 29, 2000, as amended by the \u201cFinal\nReport of the 2017-19 Harvard Square\n\nConservation District Study Committee,\u201d which after public hearing the\nHistorical Commission may adopt as regulations and thereafter amend from time\nto time.\n\nIn addition, the Historical Commission and project proponents shall consider\nthe amended goals and guidelines specific to each of the seven subdistricts\nthat make up the Harvard Square Conservation District. The subdistrict goals\nand guidelines describe the physical and historical development of each area\nover time, identify notable buildings and spaces, and set forth preservation\npriorities and recommendations for each sub-district.\n\nAs permitted by Chapter 2.78.190.B, the Historical Commission may determine\nfrom time to time after public hearing that certain categories of exterior\narchitectural features, structures, or signs may be altered without review by\nthe Commission; provided, however, that every such alteration shall be\ndetermined by the Executive Director of the Historical Commission to con- form\nto the regulations adopted by the Commission for the administration of the\nDistrict.\n\n",

NEIGHBORHOOD & LONG TERM PLANNING,\n\nPUBLIC FACILITIES, ARTS & CELEBRATION\n\nCOMMITTEE MEMBERS\n\nCouncillor Patricia Nolan, Chair\n\nCouncillor Dennis Carlone\n\nVice Mayor Alanna Mallon\n\nCouncillor Marc McGovern\n\nCouncillor Quinton Zondervan\n\n|\n\nIn City Council December 21, 2020  \n  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Neighborhood & Long-Term Planning; Public Facilities, Arts and\nCelebrations Committee held a public hearing on Wednesday, October 14, 2020 at\n2:00 p.m. in the Sullivan Chamber to discuss the process for conducting the\nfeasibility study for municipal broadband and the Request for Proposal.\n\nPresent at the hearing were Councillor Nolan, Chair of the Committee,\nCouncillor Carlone, Naomie Stephen, Executive Assistant to the City Council,\nand Paula M. Crane, Deputy City Clerk.\n\nPresent via Zoom were Vice Mayor Mallon, Councillor McGovern, Councillor\nZondervan, Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler, Mayor Siddiqui, Louis DePasquale, City\nManager, Lisa Peterson, Deputy City Manager, David Kale, Assistant City\nManager for Fiscal Affairs, Nancy Glowa, City Solicitor, Patrick McCormack,\nChief Information Officer, Information Technology Department, Lee Gianetti,\nDirector of Communications and Community Relations, Christopher Schmidt,\nHeather Hoffman, John Hawkinson, Kathy Watkins, Kavish Gandhi, Ken Field, Lee\nFarris, Phyllis Bretholtz, Roy Russell and Saul Tannenbaum.\n\nCouncillor Nolan convened the hearing and read the Call of the Meeting and the\nGovernor\u2019s Order regarding remote participation. She asked for a Roll Call to\nindicate a quorum for the hearing.\n\nThe roll was called and resulted as follows:\n\nYEAS: Councillor Nolan, Councillor Carlone, Vice Mayor Mallon,\n\nCouncillor McGovern, Councillor Zondervan -5\n\nNAYS: -0\n\nABSENT: -0\n\nand a quorum was present.\n\nCouncillor Nolan outlined steps that led to this hearing. She noted that the\nCity established a Broadband Task Force (BTF) which worked from 2014-2016, and\nissued a report that is worth reading. She said that the next step was to\nrecommend a feasibility study. She said that her understanding is that an RFP\nstarted being prepared at that time, but then work stopped and it never moved\nforward. She said that the City Council passed several orders which languished\nand never started. She said that the only thing that happened was a Digital\nEquity Study which was approved by the City Council in November of 2018, a\n12-month that was supposed to be completed last January that also was\nsignificantly delayed. She stated that she saw a draft summary of that report\nprior to taking office in December of 2019. She said that the report is still\nnot finished, and as a result the emergence of the Covid pandemic meant the\nreport was delayed even further. She noted that only this past summer were\nmany residents in public housing even surveyed. Councillor Nolan said that in\nFebruary, the City Council passed an order for an RFP for feasibility study by\nApril and in May the City Council voted down the IT budget. She said that in\nJune the City Manager promised a study with an RFP by the summer. Councillor\nNolan said that she and Vice Mayor Mallon met with City staff at the end of\nthe summer and agreed to set up a meeting to review the elements of the RFP.\nShe said that the timing is delayed yet again and the RFP has not yet been\ndrafted. She said that she is hopeful that a productive hearing can be had.\nShe explained that the Committee will begin with public comment, followed by\nremarks from City staff working on this issue. She said that a key part of the\nhearing will be questions from City staff to the City Council about\nexpectations for the study. She noted her hope that the focus will be to\nprovide guidance for City staff as they finalize the RFP.  She stated that\nanother hearing will be likely so that City staff can present where they are\nin thinking about the RFP and the study.\n\nCouncillor Nolan opening the hearing to Public Comment at 2:06 p.m.\n\nRoy Russell, 40 Cottage Street, read from a prepared written statement\n(ATTACHMENT A) regarding issues that should be included in the RFP for a\nCambridge Municipal Broadband Feasibility Study.\n\nLee Farris, 269 Norfolk Street, stated that she is speaking for the Cambridge\nResidents Alliance who have long supported some form of municipal broadband.\nShe said that it is known that there are gaps in coverage and that not\neveryone is able to get broadband for either financial reasons or the location\nwhere they live. She said that many middle- and upper-income people complain\nabout the cost, low speed and quality that we do have. She stated that she\ntrying to ensure that broadband is fast, affordable to a wide range of people\nand available to all in the city is her goal. As it relates to the delay by\nthe City, she noted that she hopes that the City will move forward quickly\nwithout further delay. She questioned if the RFP is public and if so, how it\ncan be accessed.\n\nSaul Tannenbaum, 16 Cottage Street, Upgrade Cambridge, stated that he endorses\nMr. Russell\u2019s comments. He said that almost 4 years ago, the BTF presented its\nfindings to the Committee. He said that at the time they were told that the\nCity was working on and RFP and that the City would be coming to the City\nCouncil for an appropriation. He said that never happened. He said that the\ndelay has had real world impact in terms of digital equity. He said one of the\nfindings of the BTF was to work on digital equity but because the City stopped\nworking on these, it was unprepared when the pandemic hit, and everything went\nonline. He said that he recognizes that the City Council appropriated $50,000\non digital equity issues and he would like to see a report back on that. He\nsaid that the City should own and control the infrastructure and rely on\nprivate partners to provide the retail service. He said that it is\ndisappointing at the least that we still don\u2019t have an RFP to review. He said\nthat he is fortunate to have broadband service so he can participate in the\nmeeting without problems while others cannot.\n\nChristopher Schmidt, 17 Laurel Street, thanked the City Manager for moving\nforward on this. He said that understanding the cost to build out a network is\nimportant. He said that he wants to ensure that whatever is done takes a real\nconcrete look at what the costs are including working with the Electrical\nDepartment and technical advisers. He said that he wants to ensure that the\nRFP leaves the door open to not attach costs to the day-to-day operation. He\nsaid that the focus should be on treating this as a utility. He said that we\nmust understanding what people are paying today. He said businesses must pay a\npremium for broadband services. He said that if you look at small businesses,\nthese people are paying thousands of dollars. He noted that another important\nthing to look at is understanding options for models. He said that older\nresidents depend on television and this needs to be considered in the RFP.\n\nPhyllis Bretholtz, 65 Antrim Street, stated that she supports everything that\nhas been said. She said that her biggest concern is that this is a social\njustice issue. Families are struggling to maintain sanity for their children\nand seniors who do not have access because they cannot afford it is completely\nunethical. She strongly supports the City Manager and City Council moving\nforward and she is optimistic.\n\nLouis DePasquale stated that he looks forward to the discussion. He noted that\nhe is joined by our Chief Information Officer Patrick McCormick and Director\nof Communications Lee Gianetti. He said that Pat and Lee have been involved\nwith the City\u2019s broadband efforts for a number of years -- Lee as a member of\nthe City Manager\u2019s Office and Pat as a member of the former Broadband Task\nForce and now as the City\u2019s CIO. He said that Pat and Lee are leading the\nCity\u2019s digital equity initiatives and they are leading our broadband efforts\nmoving forward.\n\nMr. DePasquale thanked the Committee Chair, Councillor Nolan, and the Vice\nMayor for organizing this meeting. He said that in June, based on feedback\nfrom the City Council, he committed to funding the next phase of a broadband\nfeasibility study with an appropriation in the fall. He said that today he\nhopes that we will be able to engage in a meaningful discussion regarding the\ngoals for our next steps and the City Council\u2019s shared expectations which will\nassist the City in finishing our scope of work.\n\nMr. DePasquale said that the Committee is aware of his doubts regarding the\nsustainability and fiscal prudence of the City exploring a municipal broadband\nsystem and given that we are in the middle of a pandemic, the potential costs\nare very concerning to him. However, he noted that he wants to be clear that\nhe is committed, like the City Council, to efforts that will help us address\ndigital divide issues in Cambridge. He said that Lee and Pat are working on an\nRFP for the next steps in our municipal broadband feasibility work and they\nare working with our consultants to conclude our digital equity study. He\nstated his hope that we will be able to prioritize a solution that primarily\naddresses the needs of our most vulnerable residents.\n\nMr. DePasquale said that there are a numerous issues and uncertainties that\nneed to be worked out for us to have a common understanding of the impact a\nmunicipal broadband system will have on both the finances of the City and\ndigital equity issues affecting our residents. He stated his hope that that as\nwe collaboratively define the goals and expectations for our upcoming\nmunicipal broadband efforts, the City Council will support efforts and\napproaches that prioritize the needs of residents who are impacted by the\ndigital divide.\n\nLee Gianetti stated that they have been working on a scope of work for next\nsteps in the broadband work. He said that before he gives an overview of how\nthe City is thinking about how they are structuring their analysis, it would\nhelpful for Pat McCormick to give a brief overview and summary of Broadband\nTask Force\u2019s recommendations and key questions that they believe should be\nincluded in the next phase of the City\u2019s efforts.\n\nFollowing Mr. McCormick\u2019s remarks, he will give the Committee an update on how\nthe City is thinking about approaching the scope of work for an RFP.\n\nPat McCormick stated that he is excited to speak on this topic. He stated that\nwhile he has only been working for the City since mid-April, he was a member\nof the BTF for the City for the entire two years. He said that he has been on\na couple of other Broadband Task Force\u2019s in other communities and he has\nworked on broadband projects around the United States and other countries. He\nsaid that it is something that is near and dear to his heart. He stated that\nfor those who are familiar with the BTF recommendations, it focuses on a few\nthings. One is an enormous challenge to be focused enough to get really useful\ninformation. He said that the initial study by Tilson was quite good but very\nbroad and wide and did not have the level of detail needed to understand the\ncost/benefits and tradeoffs that would be part of a municipal broadband\nproject. He said that the BTF recommendation was fairly specific in the\nanalysis. He said that digital equity was found by the BTF to be the #1\npriority for the city. He said that the Digital Equity Study underway will\nbring forward a lot of information. He noted that the study has taken longer\nthan anticipated but the results will be valuable. He said that Covid has been\na global case study for those working around broadband and internet access. He\nsaid that there was decent data regarding the gaps in communities that are not\nwell-served but whether it was student aged children, older residents wanting\nto connect with families in other states, or people working remotely, people\nhave been using high bandwidth applications to accomplish those things. That\nmeans that while the Digital Equity Study had to be changed in some way, they\nwere able to zero in on greater detail about connectivity issues for various\npurposes we will all benefit from having much more detail. He said that\ndigital equity and municipal broadband are two important topics to look at.\nThey are not one in the same. He said that a municipal broadband network can\nhave many benefits. He said that it is not necessarily the fastest route to\ndigital equity nor will it fully address digital equity unless that is part of\nthe mandate. As it relates to the complexity of broadband, Mr. McCormick said\nthat it is important to know exactly what benefits we are looking to achieve\nthrough a municipal broadband network. Another dimension is around business\nmodels. He said that there are many to choose from and he recommended that\nthis must be narrowed down. There are always opinions that wireless is getting\nbetter and that it may mitigate the need for high speed fiber connectivity. He\nsaid that we should zero in on something specific. Lastly, we must incorporate\nwhat are the principals that matter most to Cambridge. Mr. McCormick said that\nthe study needs to look at cost and financing, understanding that this is a\nmajor capital investment as well as a major operating cost. Lastly, we must\nlook at revenue model and how is it sustainable. He said that he is excited to\npick up where the BTF left off.\n\nLee Gianetti said that as it relates to next steps in the process, the City is\nlooking to conduct focused analysis regarding municipal broadband. The\nanalysis will incorporate the goals of the BTF and the policy goals regarding\nbroadband that the City Council has adopted. He explained that the findings\nthat are beginning to emerge from the Digital Equity Study will also inform\nthe work. He said that the city will be seeking analysis of cost, benefits,\nand risks of a municipal broadband system to allow the City to make informed\ndecisions moving forward. Clarity around the question of what is the goal is a\ncritical piece moving forward. Mr. Gianetti said that the City will be seeking\nto collect sufficient quantitative information that will allow the City to\ndetermine whether and how to pursue an appropriate municipal broadband network\nthat could meet the City\u2019s goals. They will be seeking a model for how\nCambridge can deal with digital inclusiveness and to achieve goals of the City\nCouncil and the BTF. He stated the need significant community outreach and\ninterest in the proposed solution. He said that it was something that came up\nregularly and it is important to engage the community in the process. Specific\ntasks that will be sought will include a needs gap analysis, an evaluation of\nnetwork solution, a financial feasibility analysis and funding model, and a\ndetailed marketing analysis which will be critical to look at to determine\nwhether a solution is viable to move onto the next step which would involve\ndeveloping the overall parameters for a system to help the City assess capital\nand operating costs, interconnections, insurance, bandwidth, legal\nrequirements, other costs to operate a network as well as the City\u2019s ability\nto provide operational support. He said that a comment made by a BTF member\nhas stuck in head, \u201cWe don\u2019t have engineering problem, we have a goal\nproblem.\u201d Mr. Gianetti said it comes down to what is it that we are trying to\ndo and what problem are we trying to solve. He said that as the City looks at\nfinalizing a scope of work for an RFP, it would be helpful to have more\nclarity from the City Council on what the expectations are. He said that there\nhave been various approaches and goals described in different meetings and it\nwill be helpful to understand from a City Council perspective what are the\ngoals and what are the acceptable parameters for analysis. He said that public\ncommenters have spoken about issues around the ownership of a system and what\ndoes that mean. He said the he hopes to have a high level conversation around\nvarious broadband approaches, what types of background information the City\ncan provide the City Council, and at the next meeting they can come back with\na specific proposal and provide an update on what was learned through the data\ngathered with the Digital Equity Study. He said that the data gathering phase\nis completed and consultants are working on the recommendation part of the\nreport.\n\nCouncillor Nolan thanked all City staff.\n\nCouncillor Carlone made a motion to close Public Comment. The roll was called\nand resulted as follows:\n\nYEAS: Councillor Nolan, Councillor Carlone, Vice Mayor Mallon,\n\nCouncillor McGovern, Councillor Zondervan -5\n\nNAYS: -0\n\nABSENT: -0\n\nand Public Comment was closed.\n\nCouncillor Nolan stated that she appreciates the City moving forward and she\nwould like to hold the balance of frustration of all who have been waiting for\nthis for years. She said that would have been pleased to have this in place\nwhen the pandemic hit. She said that the BTF finished its work four years ago\nand if it would have been feasible, the City could have been doing that now.\nShe said that 700 cities have networks and we are behind the curve instead of\nahead of the curve. She said that she wants the City to be diligent. She\nreminded people that the City is in the process of developing the scopes of\nservices and they want to hear what the vision is, what are the goals and to\ngive input to come back and have a more specific set of scope of services.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan stated that he is frustrated but is pleased that the\nconversation is happening. He stated that he sponsored a Policy Order\ndetailing some of the priorities that should be looked at. One main priority\nwas a digital equity study which the City has been engaged in. He said that we\nseem to be operating in this model where we assume that this has to be fee for\nservice. He said that there are a lot of reasons to question that. He said\nthat one of the simplest examples is our streets. He said that we do not\ncharge people to drive on our streets and that facilitates all the commerce\nand activities that happen in the city. He said that the broadband concept is\nthe digital road to the 21st century. He said that if we limit thinking to the\nidea that we have to charge people for service, it does not allow us to fully\nexplore the possibility of equity. He asked why couldn\u2019t we have a model where\npeople who move to Cambridge have access to the internet. He said that this\ndoes not mean its free, just as our roads are paid through taxes or other\nrevenue sources. He said that it does not have to be fee for service. He said\nthat the City could charge fees to corporations and large users. He said that\nfor residents using basic infrastructure, we could explore possibility that it\ndoes not have to be a fee for service model. Councillor Zondervan said that as\nit relates to infrastructure and putting infrastructure in roads as they are\nbeing rebuilt, we see the utility companies put infrastructure in the road but\nwe have not been willing to put in municipal broadband infrastructure in at\nthe same time. He said that there is no technology that we are aware of that\ncan move data faster than the speed of light. He said that installing fiber\noptics in the streets is a no-lose proposition. He said that the city should\nlook at beginning to put in place infrastructure so that when we decide how to\nrun it, we already have fiber in place in the streets so there would not be\nfurther delays.\n\nAs it relates to the Digital Equity Study, Vice Mayor Mallon asked when the\nCity Council might expect the full Digital Equity Study to be prepared and\npresented to the City Council. Mr. Gianetti said that he would be happy to\ngive a presentation regarding the findings from the Digital Equity Study at\nthe next hearing. He said that the consultants may be able to participate in\nthat hearing. As part of the data gathering the city has done a city-wide mail\nsurvey as well as a targeted randomized mail survey. Mr. Gianetti said that\nthe CHA has undertaken stakeholder interviews with experts, providers, service\ngroups and residents. This is building a big picture of what are the actual\nproblems and needs. He said that there is a big difference in the citywide\nsurvey and the CHA survey. He said that there is a bigger digital divide issue\nin the CHA with families in CHA housing. He said that this is where it will\nhelp inform the City as it puts together the scope for the RFP and how to\nprioritize this issue. He said that the report will be wrapped up by the end\nof November/early December. Mr. Gianetti noted that the City received the\nresults from the CHA two weeks ago.\n\nVice Mayor Mallon asked if consultants will be ready in one month\u2019s time to\nshare initial findings and thoughts. Mr. Gianetti answered in the affirmative.\nVice Mayor Mallon said she appreciates how digital inequity affects the\ncommunity during a pandemic. She said that during Covid crisis, the most hard\nhit are low income residents. She noted that her priority is ensuring that the\nmost vulnerable residents have access to high speed internet at low to no\ncost. She said that the City must seize every opportunity where we can create\npolicies and programs for those most struggling and vulnerable. She said that\nthis includes students. She said that she agrees that it is not a money\nproblem, it is a goals problem.\n\nCouncillor McGovern said that it has been said that municipal broadband is a\nway that we can address the digital divide, but not necessarily the only way.\nHe noted that if the City decided today to move towards municipal broadband,\nit would be many years before anything would be up and running. He said that\nmaybe we should look at ways to address the digital divide that is not about\nmunicipal broadband. He said that he would like to have some sense of a\ntimeline and what would be done in the meantime to ensure that people have\naccess as soon as possible. He said that we should further refine actual goals\nto ensure that we are moving in the right direction. How do we ensure that we\nhave a reliable, high speed, cost efficient service that everyone can afford\nand has access to that provides the bandwidth that people need today and into\nthe future?\n\nCouncillor Carlone said that there is a great amount of study that has taken\nplace. He said that as Vice Mayor Mallon and Councillor McGovern have said,\nhis priority is that the government as the vehicle to serve people who do not\nhave anyone serving them. He said that the cost has greatly outpaced inflation\nto people and Comcast is a highly profitable business. He said that there is\nenormous information that has not been fully shared. He agrees that this could\nhave been done a lot sooner. He said that he remembers conversations in 2014\nand 2015 about rebuilding roads in West Cambridge and not installing conduit\nfor future use seems ignorant. He said that the cost of putting in the conduit\nis 90% of the cost versus the 10% of the cable. He said that he considers the\nPort as an example where much of the roads will be rebuilt so we should be\nputting in conduit for a future system. He noted that the key point to him is\nhelping those who need it the most, including seniors who do not have the\nfunds to pay increased taxes or cable. He said Santa Monica is a huge success\nand we are light years behind.\n\nMayor Siddiqui said that City Council allocated $50,000 in the interim for\nstudents and Comcast coupon codes. She said that knowing how many families\nutilized this service and hotspots would be helpful.\n\nCouncillor Nolan stated that she is interested to read the Benton Report which\nshe will share with her colleagues on the City Council. She said that it is\nabout public and private partnerships in 2020 referencing the pandemic and one\nmodel that can be used in municipal broadband. She said that it talks about\nthe emerging model and she is interested to see the City reference that. She\nsuggested that the City sit down with Upgrade Cambridge and/or brought back a\ntask force as the scope of services is developed. Mr. Gianetti said that they\nhave not engaged members of the community, but he will confer with Mr.\nMcCormick to see how to engage people during the development phase. Councillor\nNolan said that we must build on work that has already been done and it would\nbe great to reach out to Upgrade Cambridge who has galvanized thousands of\npeople across the city so that this will be a truly inclusive process. She\nsaid that her goal is to have a network across the entire city. She stated\nthat she would like to ensure that the goal for Cambridge is to provide better\nservice across the city with true inclusion and equity. She said that people\ncould pay various amounts but with quality service. She suggested outreach to\nlook at other models asked if any of those models will be incorporated into\nthe scope of services. Councillor asked if we are including for best practice\nideas. Mr. McCormick responded that they would be looking at different models.\nHe said that he agrees that the majority of municipal broadband networks are\nfee for service. He said that in general, if many residents and businesses are\nwilling to pay a similar price to what they pay now for better service then\nthat would allow room for some means tested effort to have a more affordable\nservice of equal quality for those most vulnerable. He noted that you would\nneed sufficient revenue to balance off subsidized services. He said that you\nwould also need the take rate to be high enough to make it work. He stated\nthat one challenge is that municipal broadband is some version of a natural\nmonopoly. He said that there is nothing preventing another provider from\ncoming into Cambridge. We do not have an exclusive arrangement with Comcast to\nbuild a network. There is a high cost associated with building a network.\nThese are very important elements to a study to understand the cost and\nfeasibility to allow us to sustainably to operate in both the capital\ninvestment and operating costs.\n\nVice Mayor Mallon stated that she would like members of city staff to meet\nwith Upgrade Cambridge because there are benefits to have this group weigh in.\nShe asked if there should be a motion that city staff meet with members of\nUpgrade Cambridge prior to the next hearing to ensure that they are\nrepresented on the RFP. She said that sometimes small businesses pay thousands\nof dolls for internet service. She asked if the city reached out to small\nbusinesses in the digital equity survey. Mr. McCormick said that the DES did\nnot look at business service, only residential. Vice Mayor Mallon asked if\nthere is any data around small business internet connectivity and cost? Mr.\nGianetti responded that he will investigate that and if that is a gap area,\nthey will talk to consultants on the small business piece. Vice Mayor Mallon\nsaid that small businesses have been hit hard by Covid and this could keep and\nattract small business owners. She said that any data or study that we have on\ncost to small businesses will be helpful.\n\nAs it relates to the City providing Comcast free of charge to students for 12\nmonths, Vice Mayor Mallon said that she agrees that municipal broadband is not\nthe quickest way to solve the digital equity problem, but this could be a\nbridge to low income residents and seniors and students. As it relates to the\nBenton Report, Vice Mayor Mallon said that she wonders if the City Council\ncould include in the RFP the exploration of a PPP model for moving forward.\n\nVice Mayor Mallon asked if a motion should be made to have the City the\nCommittee should make a motion to have the City team meet with Upgrade\nCambridge around goals for the RFP prior to the next hearing. Louis DePasquale\nresponded that he will happy to do so and will reach out to Upgrade Cambridge\nas soon as possible. Councillor Nolan stated that makes sense given the\ntiming.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan said that small businesses can be considered part of the\nresidential customers in terms of broadband. He said that in a sense, just\nlike the roads, a municipal broadband system is a national monopoly because it\ndoes not make a lot of sense to have duplicate cables running under the street\ncompeting with each other to move the information. He said that if we stay\nstuck in a fee for service model, we are limiting ourselves in terms of what\nwe can be achieved. He said that a lot of other places that have been looked,\ndid not have real access for residents. Essentially, they had guaranteed\ncustomers. He said that in Cambridge it is more complicated because we do have\nComcast and they provide some level of internet service. Verizon provides a\ndifferent internet service as well. He said that if we change the paradigm and\ntreat it more like the roads and put the infrastructure in place and it is\ntaxpayer funded and everyone has equal access to it then it opens up a lot\nmore opportunity for us to ensure true equity of access. He said that fee for\nservice does not need to be the only option. He said that we have known about\nthe digital divide for many years and have been unwilling to confront the\nissue. He concluded by stating that there is a lot of opportunity to address\nthese issues.\n\nCouncillor Carlone said that it is interesting that the City Council is\nstrongly pushing this issue. He said that he does a lot of reading on urban\nhistory and infrastructure is a key part of that. He asked Mr. McCormick if we\nare aware of a different kind of breakthrough in communication. If not, this\nbecomes more pressing because everyday matters. He asked if there is there\nsome advancement that is worth waiting for or is this as good as it is going\nto get? Mr. McCormick said that the internet for the near future is here to\nstay for various communication needs. In terms of the way you access the\ninternet, there is always a debate of wireless, for example, catching up. He\nsaid that today\u2019s big debate is around 5G. Over time, it will offer faster\nspeeds than we are used to via wireless. He said that fiber is the best way to\nhave connectivity. He explained that fiber operates close to the speed of\nlight and the hardware on the fiber cable can be upgraded without replacing\nthe cable itself. He expects that we will get higher speeds from fiber cables\neven as wireless tries to catch up\n\nCouncillor Zondervan said that terms of competition, he did not mean to\nsuggest that there is no competition but that the situation is different when\nthere are well established players and we are trying to compete with them\nversus when there are a lot of customers who are available either because we\nare able to offer a much improved level of service or because they simply\ndon\u2019t have access to broadband. He said that if the model is limited to \u201cCan\nwe compete with Comcast?\u201d we may well talk ourselves out of offering municipal\nbroadband which would be a huge mistake. In response to Councillor Carlone\u2019s\nquestion to Mr. McCormick, he added that the known laws of physics do not\nallow for faster transmission of information than the speed of light so it is\nunlikely that we will find better than fiber cable.\n\nCouncillor Nolan said that Loveland, Colorado had a lot of competitors. She\nsaid that her go to would be Chattanooga, Tennessee. She said that it is a\ntotally different place and yet the fact that after they did municipal\nbroadband the State of Tennessee forbid it. It wasn\u2019t because it wasn\u2019t\nworking it was because it was working so well that they understood that they\nwere going to prevent other municipalities from doing it. She said that the\nCity should be at the forefront of this. She said that the City has stood in\nfavor of net neutrality and open access. She asked if this is something that\nthe City needs direction on as it relates to being an important element. She\nsaid that her understanding is that separate from this, the City Council has\npassed resolutions in favor of ensuring that neutrality and open access. Mr.\nGianetti responded that the city has received clear direction from the\nCommittee on those issues.\n\nCouncillor Nolan asked Mr. Gianetti if enough information has been gleaned\nfrom the Committee. Mr. Gianetti replied that the City has received everything\nthat is needed for follow-up steps.\n\nMr. McCormack thanked all for input. He said that we are collectively close to\nthe recommendation that was made by the BTF. He said that the conversation\nwith Upgrade Cambridge will be another opportunity to test a gap analysis\nagainst that.\n\nCouncillor Nolan thanked all those present for their attendance.\n\nCouncillor Carlone made a motion to adjourn. The roll was called and resulted\nas follows:\n\nYEAS: Councillor Nolan, Councillor Carlone, Vice Mayor Mallon,\n\nCouncillor McGovern, Councillor Zondervan -5\n\nNAYS: -0\n\nABSENT: -0\n\nand the hearing was adjourned at 3:43 p.m.\n\nFor the Committee,\n\n________________________________\n\nCouncillor Patricia Nolan, Chair\n\nNeighborhood & Long-Term Planning;\n\nPublic Facilities, Arts and Celebrations Committee\n\n",

Portions of the Project are not accessible by streets located\nin either Boston or Somerville and are only accessible by emergency responders\nby streets located in the City of Cambridge.  \n  \nThe laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts generally prohibit\nmunicipalities from providing emergency services to properties located outside\nof their municipal boundaries. While there are certain exceptions for\ninstances of mutual aid, the municipality in which a specific parcel of real\nestate is located is generally responsible for the provision of police, fire\nand other emergency services to such parcels and the buildings located on the\nparcels and the occupants of those buildings.  \n  \nIn addition, Massachusetts law prevents municipalities from assessing taxes or\nother municipal charges against properties not situated within its municipal\nboundaries. Therefore, the special legislation that is enclosed here also\nwould authorize the City to impose fees on the owner of any parcel located\nwithin the Project for the provision of these Emergency Services.\n\n",

HOUSING COMMITTEE MEMBERS\n\nCouncillor E. Denise Simmons, Co-Chair\n\nCouncillor Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler, Co-Chair\n\nVice Mayor Alanna M. Mallon\n\nCouncillor Marc McGovern\n\nCouncillor Quinton Zondervan\n\n|\n\nIn City Council December 14, 2020  \n  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Housing Committee held a public hearing on Thursday, October 22, 2020 at\n5:30 p.m. in the Sullivan Chamber to receive an update from the Community\nDevelopment Department and the Affordable Housing Trust Fund on potential\nchanges made to the eligibility preferences for the Inclusionary Housing\nProgram.\n\nPresent at the hearing were Councillor Simmons, Naomie Stephen, Neal Alpert,\nand Paula M. Crane, Deputy City Clerk.\n\nParticipating in the hearing via Zoom were Councilor Sobrinho-Wheeler, Vice\nMayor Mallon, Councillor McGovern, Councillor Zondervan, Councillor Nolan,\nMayor Siddiqui, Chris Cotter, Housing Director, Justine Cabrera, Justine\nCabrera, Senior Manager for Inclusionary Housing, Linda Prosnitz, Housing\nProject Planner, Community Development Department (CDD), Maura Pensak, Housing\nLiaison to the City Manager, Michael Johnston, Executive Director, Cambridge\nHousing Authority (CHA), Nancy Glowa, City Solicitor , Tina Alu, Executive\nDirector, CEOC, Anthony Wilson, City Clerk, Bo Fuji, Heather Hoffman, James\nWilliamson, and John Hawkinson.\n\nCouncillor Simmons read the Governor\u2019s Order relating to Zoom participation.\nCouncillor Simmons requested the Deputy City Clerk call the roll to indicate a\nquorum for the hearing and that the hearing was clearly audible to Zoom\nparticipants.\n\nThe roll was called and resulted as follows:\n\nPRESENT: Councillor Simmons, Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler, Vice Mayor Mallon\nand Councillor McGovern -4\n\nABSENT: Councillor Zondervan -1\n\nA quorum was present.\n\nCouncillor Simmons read from a prepared written opening statement (ATTACHMENT\nA). She then invited Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler for his opening remarks.\n\nCouncillor Sobrinho-Wheeler stated that Cambridge is facing an affordable\nhousing crisis. He said that there are parts that must be addressed via state\nand federal funding. He said that Inclusionary Housing preferences are under\nthe control of the City Council, that this is a tangible step that can be\ntaken on the local level, and that he is excited to hear this evening\u2019s\npresentation.\n\nCouncillor Simmons noted that the Housing Committee received a communication\nfrom Kavish Gandhi and asked that this communication be made part of the\npermanent record of the hearing.\n\nCouncillor Simmons opened the hearing to Public Comment.\n\nHeather Hoffman, 213 Hurley Street, stated that she is glad to see this issue\ngetting some attention. She said that she wondered whether an additional item\ncould be considered: she said that she knows numerous people who live in\nInclusionary units who have wanted to take in a homeless person (people whom\nthey already know) to live with them, but have been prevented from doing so\nbecause of the existing rules. She said that this would be a more efficient\nuse of the housing that we have available, and she hopes that the City Council\nconsiders changing the rules to allow this, if it is found to be legal to do\nso. She said this change in the rules could help some people to not be\nhomeless.\n\nJames Williamson, 1000 Jackson Place, stated that he did not have any comment\nprior to viewing the presentation by CDD.\n\nCouncillor Simmons stated that Public Comment will remain open until 6:00 p.m.\n\nCouncillor Simmons invited Chris Cotter to introduce the City team for this\nhearing. He stated that Justine Cabrera and Linda Prosnitz from the Community\nDevelopment Department were joining in on tonight\u2019s meeting, as well as Maura\nPensak, the Housing Liaison to the City Manager, and City Solicitor Nancy\nGlowa. He said that they are all happy to continue the conversation. He said\nthat his department has spent a long time working on the Inclusionary\nrecommendations with the Affordable Housing Trust, and they are pleased to\npresent these recommendations to the Housing Committee tonight and to receive\nfeedback. Mr. Cotter said that when thinking about potentially changing\npreferences, we unavoidably advantage some and disadvantage others. He said it\nis a very challenging thing to do. He said that his team has been able to talk\nand work with feedback they\u2019ve been given in order to revise these\npreferences. He said that the Affordable Housing Trust was building off of\nwhat they had previously heard from the City Council. Mr. Cotter gave an\noverview of a PowerPoint presentation titled Inclusionary Housing Resident\nSelection Preferences. (ATTACHMENT B).\n\nAs Mr. Cotter wrapped up his presentation, he said that he looks forward to\ngetting comments and feedback on this during and following this hearing. He\nsaid that the next steps would be for his team to put this material into draft\nstandards and procedures for resident selection. He said this would then be\nlooked at by the Law Department. He said that they want to expand the\ndocumentation requirements for residents, that there would be a revised and\nupdated document explaining how we define what a resident is and what the City\nwould accept for documentation, and that the CDD has heard from staff, from\nresidents, and from the Council that they want to give applicants more choices\nand opportunities to confirm their residency. He said they will put this\ndocument together in such a way that is consistent with the Ordinance, and\nthen this would be put into a draft form for Public Comment. That Public\nComment period would need to be at least 30 days, it would be shared with all\napplicants, with residents, with building managers, and with anyone with a\nstake in the program to solicit their feedback. Following that process, the\nTrust would then review that feedback, process through it into a final draft,\nwhich would then become effective in changing the preference system.\n\nCouncillor Simmons thanked Mr. Cotter and then asked about the \u201cNext Steps\u201d\nslide of the presentation. She asked if the draft recommendations go to the\nAffordable Housing Trust, then to the Law Department, and then back to the\nHousing Committee before going to the City Council? She said it was not quite\nclear to her. Chris Cotter said that there is no formal role for the\nAffordable Housing Trust in adopting any of these changes under the\nInclusionary Ordinance. He said that under the Ordinance, it is the Community\nDevelopment Department that has the authority to make these changes, with\npolicy input from the City Council. He said that the CDD would draft standards\nand procedures for the Inclusionary Program, they would then put them out for\nPublic Comment for 30 days; following that, the CDD would adapt based on the\nfeedback they received, and then the CDD would issue final standards and\nprocedures. He said that the next steps are for the Community Development\nDepartment to draft, in consultation with the Law Department, the document to\nensure that it is being responsive to the requested changes, while adhering to\nthe law. Mr. Cotter said that the Community Development Department certainly\ncould come back and present these proposed final draft changes to the Housing\nCommittee if that is requested. He said that the CDD understands the desire\nfor this process to move forward quickly, and that it would likely take at\nleast a couple of months. He said that we are currently talking about the\ngeneral policy approach, but there are many details that need to be ironed out\nas it related to \u201cresidents.\u201d Councillor Simmons concurred that it would be a\ngood idea to have the CDD come back and present this to the Housing Committee\nat least one more time prior to finalizing it.\n\nCouncillor McGovern made a motion to close Public Comment.\n\nThe roll was called and resulted as follows:\n\nYEAS: Councillor Simmons, Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler, Vice Mayor Mallon,\nCouncillor McGovern and Councillor Zondervan -5\n\nNAYS: -0\n\nand Public Comment was closed.\n\nCouncillor McGovern asked Mr. Cotter to discuss Slide #3, \u201cNumber of\nApplicants.\u201d He asked, of the 2,322 applicants who are classified as non-\nresident/non-worker, if we know how many formerly resided in Cambridge. Mr.\nCotter replied that there is no way to know that, as it is not criteria\nincluded in our applications. Councillor McGovern said that to get a true\nsense of the list, in terms of which applicants have Cambridge ties, his\npreference would be to see someone who formerly lived in Cambridge and had to\nmove out because of rising rents now have the ability to come back to\nCambridge. Regarding the list that has the breakdown by unit \u2013 which is based\non the total of 3,243 applicants \u2013 Councillor McGovern asked if we know how\nmany of the 921 Cambridge applicants want a 1 bedroom, or a 2 bedroom? Mr.\nCotter said that we know for the 683 applicants \u2013 of those, we have roughly\n100 applicants in the 1 bedroom pool, with the balance evenly split between\nthe 2 and 3 bedroom pool. Councillor McGovern said that this is important,\nbecause this makes it look like the majority of applicants want a 1 or 2\nbedroom, but if just broken down by Cambridge residents, that may not actually\nbe the case. Mr. Cotter responded by saying that in some ways, what\u2019s more\nreadily available can actually drive the applicants, using the example that we\nknow 3 bedroom units in this program are rare, and thus we do not see as many\npeople applying for 3 bedroom units (because many would-be applicants realize\nhow challenging it would be to obtain a 3 bedroom unit and therefore they do\nnot apply for the program).\n\nCouncillor McGovern said that, for the Cambridge residents out of that pool of\n683 applicants, 100 are waiting for a 1 bedroom and the rest are waiting for\neither a 2 bedroom or a 3 bedroom, and that is a different breakdown than what\nis shown on Slide 3. Councillor McGovern said that on this slide, it looks\nlike most applicants are waiting for 1 bedroom units. Mr. Cotter said that\nthis reflects the fact that the program is able to serve 1 bedroom applicants\nmore quickly, and we don\u2019t typically get to the non-Cambridge residents. He\nsaid that the program sees the most unmet demand in family sized units.\nCouncillor McGovern said that he really wants to prioritize the program for\npeople who are in Cambridge and have been here, as opposed to applicants with\nno previous ties to Cambridge and who may never have set foot in Cambridge.\n\nIn regards to the emergency designation based around homelessness, Councillor\nMcGovern has had to say to people who are unhoused and are couch surfing that\nthey must spend a couple nights in a shelter so they can qualify as being\nhomeless. He said that it is awful to tell someone that this is what they must\ndo. He asked if we have thought about the couch-surfing issue, and is there a\nway to include those people as emergency homeless applicants? Mr. Cotter said\nthat as we think about changes and developing more details, the Trust has\ntalked about trying to be more expansive in terms of how homeless applicants\nare looked at. He said that the concern is that it becomes an easy threshold\nto meet, if we simply take people at their word that they\u2019ve been couch\nsurfing, and then everyone now meets this emergency criteria. He said that the\nTrust has talked about looking at expanding the types of resources that they\nrely on to confirm that someone is homeless, such as looking at if they\u2019re\nworking with a service provider, or with a social worker.\n\nCouncillor McGovern said that he does still worry about the \u201ccliff effect\u201d\nwhere someone living in an Inclusionary unit has the opportunity to get a\nraise at work, and if they accept the raise they make just enough money to now\nbe just over income, and they no longer qualify for the Inclusionary Housing\nprogram, but they don\u2019t make enough money to rent a non-subsidized unit, nor\nenough to buy a unit. He asked if there is any way to address that issue, and\nis it as big an issue as he believes it is. Mr. Cotter said that the CDD does\nsee this from time to time, but it is not an overwhelming issue to the extent\nthat it is brought to the CDD\u2019s attention. He said that for the home ownership\nprogram, there is no ceiling in terms of income eligibility once a person has\nsigned on to the program and has purchased a unit. In terms of the\nInclusionary Rental program, he said that there is a built in cushion in the\nordinance for a tenant to remain eligible, and to the extent that an\nInclusionary tenant\u2019s income extends over 100 percent AMI, which has happened\non occasion, then CDD works with those people to look at their options, and\nthey have had success on a case-by-case basis. Councillor McGovern said that\nit is important to let people know about this, as there may be many cases\nwhere it doesn\u2019t reach the attention of the CDD because tenants facing that\nraise that places them just above the income threshold ultimately decide not\nto take the job, for fear of jeopardizing their housing.\n\nCouncillor Sobrinho-Wheeler said that, in terms of feedback, he agreed with\nCouncillor McGovern\u2019s points in needing to expand how we define homelessness\nand the documentation that is accepted. He said that we must explore giving\nadditional weight to emergency housing needs. He said that we must prevent\nmore people from getting priced out of Cambridge. We should also make sure we\nare increasing information to applicants and current participants, and we also\nneed to increase the information to applicants about income changes they may\nexperience during their wait.\n\nCouncillor Sobrinho-Wheeler asked how the CDD looks at preferences from other\naffordable housing providers in Cambridge, and how changing the Inclusionary\npreferences can be done to possibly meet the needs that are not being met by\nthose other housing providers. For example, he cited that military veterans\nare given the same weighted preference at the Cambridge Housing Authority\nwhether they come from Cambridge or whether they applied from out of state; if\nthe veterans preference is already being addressed by the CHA, he asked if\nthere might be other preferences that we could be addressing here. Mr. Cotter\nconfirmed that some of the emergency criteria is more in line with what the\nCHA has in their criteria, but the CDD has kept some things that CHA does not\nhave. He said the big difference is the preference for families with children,\nand this is not a typical preference that is seen. Mr. Cotter said that, by\nand large, our preference system is about as complex as one will find; in the\nCHA, you either get local preference or you don\u2019t, but in the Inclusionary\nprogram there is a graduated approach that is pretty complicated.\n\nCouncillor Sobrinho-Wheeler asked if there is a way to have a preference for\npeople that grew up in affordable housing. Mr. Cotter responded that it is\nsomething that has been discussed. He said that most residency preferences are\neither live in or work in the community. He said that moving away from this\ncould begin to create questions of fair housing. The advice the CDD has had is\nto not have preferences that require some duration of time, or time limited\npreference, or something that looks back very far into a person\u2019s housing\nhistory. He said that the CDD is now looking to include provisions that would\ninclude former residents.\n\nCouncillor Sobrinho-Wheeler said that he would like to think about changes\nwhere, if you have a family member or friend that you can stay with, but if\nyou grew up in affordable housing and cannot go back to your family, it should\nbe addressed. He said that he would be happy to follow up on this thread at a\nlater time.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan stated that this is a complex problem, and we clearly\nhave a huge need for emergency housing. He stated that one of the things that\nhe is seeing are cases where someone who was a Cambridge resident 4-5 years\nago is now homeless, and how do we better address the needs of these people.\nMr. Cotter said that in cases of someone who is homeless and whose last\npermanent address was in Cambridge, they would get the benefit of the\npreference. Councilor Zondervan said that he would appreciate an early look at\nsome of the more detailed definitions of \u201cresident\u201d and of \u201chomeless\u201d that CDD\ncomes up with. In terms of the point system for emergency housing, Councilor\nZondervan said that he appreciates the effort into looking into this. He asked\nif it reasonable to try to increase the weight of the homeless preference, in\nsome way. Mr. Cotter responded that the CDD is happy to get the feedback on\nthe weighing of the various points, and they want to hear from the City\nCouncil on what the priorities were. In terms of emergency housing, they have\ntried to allow the emergency need to surpass the preference for veterans and\nfamilies with children. He said that the question is more about the residency.\nWith applicants that are homeless, he said that they try to look at the whole\npicture. Councillor Zondervan said that he appreciates the difficulty of the\nchallenge.\n\nWith regards to better serving those with Cambridge ties who are currently\nhomeless, Councillor Zondervan mused that there may be a way to better align\nthe CDD\u2019s criteria with the criteria utilized by the local shelters to confirm\nsomeone as being a Cambridge resident.\n\nVice Mayor Mallon stated that there are people in emergency situations that\ncould be affected by potential changes. Regarding the list that was shown by\nMr. Cotter, she said it would be helpful to have it broken out by bedroom type\nand by Cambridge residents versus non-residents. In terms of recently\ndisplaced former residents, she asked what documentation is going to be\nneeded? Mr. Cotter said that they try to be flexible, and they might look at a\npast lease, a past utility bill, and a range of other options. Vice Mayor\nMallon asked if the CDD had any idea what additional documentation may be\nconsidered in proving residency. Mr. Cotter said that they are in the process\nof discussing how they might expand residency documentation, and they are\ntrying to give people more choices in documentation. He said that they might\nconsider weighting different documents to provide greater flexibility. He said\nthat CDD has been looking to other housing programs and other cities to look\nat different models, and this is still being developed. Vice Mayor Mallon\nthanked Mr. Cotter for this work so far, and she looks forward to the next\npart of this process.\n\nMayor Siddiqui said that this has come a long way since June of 2019, and many\nsuggestions of the City Council have been incorporated. She said that, with\nregards to documentation to homelessness, many families who are couch surfing\nare in touch with City departments, such as the Mayor\u2019s Office or the Multi\nService Center, and she suggests that perhaps we broaden the scope to include\npeople that have worked been working with City departments or agencies as\nproof of homelessness.\n\nCouncillor Simmons asked Mr. Cotter, regarding Slide 7: when the CDD is\nlooking at former residents who met residency requirements at time of\napplication, are we speaking to those who hold a mobile voucher? Mr. Cotter\nsaid yes and no. He said that the CDD had recommended, in the last meeting, to\npreserve residency status of any applicant in the program as long as they have\nan active application. This means that if someone lived in Cambridge when they\napplied to the program, they then are forced out of the City, and then their\nname reaches to the top of the list, they will be still be treated as a\nCambridge resident because they were a resident at the time of applying. Mr.\nCotter said that this is the change that CDD thinks will most dramatically\naffect resident applicants. He said that the second piece involves Cambridge\nresidents who are issued a voucher, cannot find a unit in Cambridge, and\nsecure a unit outside the City in order to keep their voucher active. Mr.\nCotter that the new change being recommended is that these people, who have\nbeen displaced from Cambridge, would be able to apply for an Inclusionary Unit\nfor up to one year after leaving Cambridge and they will still be treated as\nCambridge residents, and this will be a big boost to giving these people the\nopportunity to move back to the City.\n\nCouncillor Simmons said that she was happy to see the new veteran status. In\nterms of emergency need, she asked where domestic violence survivors fall in\nthese criteria. Mr. Cotter said that on page 10, victims of domestic violence\nare listed. He said that the CDD wants to have the appropriate definitions in\nplace, but they have allowed some flexibility for applicants to meet the\ncriteria.\n\nRegarding time-limited transitional housing, Councillor Simmons asked if this\nhousing wouldn\u2019t necessarily have to be in Cambridge. Mr. Cotter said that\nsomeone living outside of Cambridge would get that preference, but would not\nnecessarily get the residency preference. He said that CDD would look at the\naddress of the person prior to entering transitional housing. Councillor\nSimmons said that some victims of domestic violence have their address\nembargoed for safety purposes, and we would not want this to be an impediment\nto their getting housed. Mr. Cotter said that this is something that can be\nlooked at when planning out how to establish criteria for that preference.\n\nCouncillor Simmons then asked Mike Johnston or Maura Pensak for comments.\n\nMaura Pensak stated that she does not have anything to add, but that she\nappreciates the work of CDD and she appreciates expanding emergency and\nresidency requirements, and recognizing the need of folks with children over\nthe age of six having high priority. She looks forward to the next steps of\nthis process.\n\nMike Johnston stated that Mr. Cotter and his staff have done a great job, he\nthinks this is a great piece of work, and he looks forward to seeing it put in\nplace.\n\nCouncillor Simmons thanked Mr. Cotter and his staff, she said that this has\nbeen a long time getting to this place and she wants this issue to be\nexpedited. She invited the Housing Committee members to put into writing any\nadditional questions that they may have and she will have this material\nforwarded to Mr. Cotter.\n\nCouncillor Simmons summarized her understanding that Mr. Cotter will now take\nrecommendations and thoughts from the Housing Committee and work to update the\nguidelines, there will then be a 30 day period of Public Comment, then this\nwill be brought back to the Housing Committee. She said that having a written\ntimeline submitted to the committee would be helpful. Mr. Cotter confirmed\nthat the next steps are to take what has been presented tonight and develop\ndraft standards and procedures. He said he will share that with the City\nCouncil, and the schedule will include a 30 day public review comment process.\nHe said that we will want to comply with the ordinance, and this will be\nmapped out. Councillor Simmons asked that Mr. Cotter get a timeline for the\nstandards and procedures and then sit with the Housing Committee Co-Chairs to\nensure that it fits with the trajectory. She said she would like to receive a\ntimeline and then work through and get back to the committee, and Councillor\nSobrinho-Wheeler concurred.\n\nCouncillor Simmons thanked the Committee, she said she is excited to move the\nprocess forward, and she is committed to working as expeditiously as possible\nto move this along.\n\nCouncillor Simmons and Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler thanked all those present\nfor their attendance.\n\nOn a motion by Vice Mayor Mallon to adjourn the hearing, the roll was called\nand resulted as follows:\n\nYEAS: Councillor Simmons, Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler, Vice Mayor Mallon,\nCouncillor McGovern and Councillor Zondervan -5\n\nNAYS: -0\n\nAnd the meeting was adjourned at 7:30 p.m.\n\nFor the Committee,\n\n________________________________\n\nCouncillor E.

The Affordable Housing Trust recently approved\nchanges which will allow for this program expansion.  \n  \nHomeBridge is a component of the City\u2019s homebuyer assistance programs which\noffers direct funding to homebuyers purchasing homes on the market. Through\nHomeBridge, the City provides buyers with between 40% and 50% of their home\npurchase price. HomeBridge, and similar prior assistance programs, have been\nfunded by the Trust with Community Preservation Act (CPA) funds. CPA funds can\nbe used to assist households whose incomes are less than 100% AMI. Homes\npurchased with HomeBridge funding become part of the City\u2019s stock of deed-\nrestricted affordable housing.  \n  \nAt its meeting on November 19th, the Trust approved measures needed to expand\nHomeBridge to households earning up to 120% AMI. The Trust also approved $3\nmillion in funding for households earning between 100% and 120% AMI, which is\nexpected to serve at least 8 to 10 homebuyers. CDD is now planning for the\nlaunch of this new program component which is expected to be available in\nJanuary.\n\n",

I am hereby requesting the following two (2) appropriations related to the\nFoundry:\n\n1) First, I am requesting an appropriation of $6.0 million from Free Cash to\nthe Public Investment Fund Department of Public Works Extraordinary\nExpenditures Account;\n\n2) Second, I am requesting an appropriation of $3.5 million received from the\nCambridge Redevelopment Authority (CRA) to the Public Investment Fund\nDepartment of Public Works Extraordinary Expenditures Account.\n\n  \nThe total cost for the design and construction for the Foundry Building is now\n$45.5 million.\n\nThis includes a total construction cost, or Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP),\nwith our contractor, of $37.5 million; and design, administration and\ncontingency costs of $8 million. This brings the City\u2019s total contribution for\nthe design and construction of the Foundry to $35 million and the CRA\u2019s\ncontribution to $10.5 million. (The CRA is also contributing an additional\n$500,000 for a total of $2.5 million to operating costs once the facility\nopens.)\n\nThis is a substantial increase from the original budget estimates and a $9.5\nmillion increase over our 50% construction estimates which were pre-pandemic.\nUnanticipated costs are related to the following factors:  \n\n\u00b7 Significant structural deficiencies with the existing wood trusses,\nincluding possibly the need to replace the existing wood roof sheathing.\n\n\u00b7 The new structural steel frame for the interior floors and required seismic\nreinforcement of the building needed a more significant foundation system\nwhich requires significantly more removal of contaminated soil and\ninstallation of a vapor mitigation system required by the Massachusetts\nDepartment of Environmental Protection to vent the underside of the floor\nslab.\n\n\u00b7 The publicly bid Trade Contractors were $2 million over estimates ($10\nmillion vs. $8 million estimated)\n\n\u00b7 Additional costs for wood windows, the exterior metal panel selection, &\ninterior woodwork.\n\n\u00b7 Roadway reconstruction on Rogers and Bent Street and a new intersection\ndesign at Rogers and Third Streets that is intended to help draw the public\nfrom Toomey Park and the intersection to the Foundry Building. The roadway and\nlandscaping is presently estimated to be $2.2 million but is also actively\nbeing evaluated for cost reductions.\n\nTotal additional cost now needed to complete this project is $9.5 million. We\nare actively exploring ways to reduce costs for this project, and any savings\nto the $37.5 million GMP will be returned to the City at the completion of the\nproject. We expect to share this savings proportionately with the Cambridge\nRedevelopment Authority.  \n  \nI recommend your approval of these appropriations.\n\n",

I am hereby requesting the appropriation of $9,277,190 from Free Cash to the\nGeneral Fund School Department Salaries and Wages account ($7,446,360),\nGeneral Fund School Department Other Ordinary Maintenance account\n($1,781,455), and General Fund School Department Travel and Training account\n($49,375), to fund additional costs associated with the reopening of schools\nwith health and safety mitigations related to COVID-19. The School Committee\nOrder is attached.\n\nRe-opening schools during the COVID-19 global pandemic has required\nsubstantial investments in health and safety mitigations, as well as\nadditional staff, technology and instructional supports. In total, the\nestimated costs related to preparing and operating the City\u2019s schools for the\n2020-21 school year is $16.3 million. The School Department has identified\napproximately $7 million to fund these costs: $5.4 million in federal\nCoronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act funding and other\ngrants; and $1.6 million in reallocated FY21 General Fund budget line items.\nIn order to finance the balance of the estimated costs, an additional\n$9,277,190 is needed.\n\nAdditional costs ($16.3M total) include:\n\n\u00b7 Health & Safety Expenses ($5.4 million) - including Personal Protective\nEquipment for staff and students; additional sinks for hand washing in school\nbuildings; improvements related to the ventilation systems including air\nscrubbers with HEPA filters, box fans, window repairs, an engineering study\nand a planned project to implement the recommendations of the engineering\nstudy; on-site COVID-19 testing for staff two times per week;\n\n\u00b7 Additional School-based Staff ($6.5 million) - in order to support social\ndistancing of 6 feet within classrooms and to address additional special\neducation service requirements;\n\n\u00b7 Instructional Supports ($1.9 million) - including the Extended Learning Time\nprogram at the M.L. King School and Fletcher Maynard Academy; instructional\nmaterials sent home to students who are learning remotely; expanded summer\nprogramming; funding for planning time for teachers and paraprofessionals\nworking in-person;\n\n\u00b7 Technology ($1.3 million) - Including additional Chromebooks (to ensure that\nevery student has one); additional and expanded software licenses to support\nremote learning; system upgrades; Hot Spots for families; additional\ntechnology staff to support expanded technology and data needs;\n\n\u00b7 Planning & Engagement ($688K) - including educator Collaboratives; task\nforce and working groups; school planning; principal and summer work;\n\n\u00b7 School Lunch Program ($470K) - The USDA has issued a waiver that allows the\ndistrict to offer free meals to all students, not just those who qualify for\nFree/Reduced lunch.

I am herby requesting an appropriation of $850,000 from Free Cash to the\nPublic Investment Fund Public Works Department Extraordinary Expenditures\naccount, for a 30 -Year Post Closure Evaluation and Report of Danehy Park.  \n  \nDanehy Park was opened in 1990 and is a 50-acre open space that provides\nsports fields, walking paths, a dog park, and other open space amenities for\nthe community. Prior to its use as a city park, the area was predominately\nclay, and between 1847-1952, the clay was extracted to manufacture bricks by\nthe New England Brick Company. The result was a deep clay pit that the City\nused as its landfill between 1952 and 1971. With the capping of the landfill\nand the creation of the Park in 1990, the city reclaimed what was a waste site\nand turned it into a significant community resource.  \n  \nPermitting of the site is managed through the MassDEP, Division of Solid Waste\nin order to ensure that the site is managed in a safe manner and that landfill\ngases are properly managed and allowed to safely vent. The City contracts with\nCDM Smith to conduct quarterly monitoring, inspect the methane trench (which\nis the stone-filled trench around the perimeter of the park) quarterly, and\ndevelop an annual environmental monitoring report that is submitted to\nMassDEP.  \n  \nWhen the landfill was closed, MassDEP Solid Waste Management Regulations\nrequired the owner of a closed landfill to maintain, care for, and monitor the\nsite during the post-closure period of a minimum of 30 years. Funds will be\nused to develop a 30-year Post Closure Report which will require, additional\ntesting; an assessment as to the integrity of the existing cap, stormwater\nfeatures, and landfill gas controls; an update to the environmental monitoring\nand maintenance plan; as well as an evaluation of the condition and\nfunctionality of the existing vent trench, and analysis of the cumulative\neffect of siltation on the vent trench system.\n\n",

On June 8, 2020, I updated you on the City\u2019s efforts to respond to the\nrestaurant community\u2019s need to expand outdoor dining services and I requested\nand received the City Council\u2019s authorization to grant street obstruction\napprovals, which are required for restaurants to operate outdoor dining on the\nsidewalk or street, from that date until November 30, 2020. I am now\nrequesting that the City Council extend its prior authorization for me or my\ndesignee to grant such approvals, along with any other necessary approvals for\ntemporary street obstructions, from this date until sixty (60) days past the\nend of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts State of Emergency.  \n  \nOn June 1, 2020, Governor Baker issued an Order Clarifying the Progression of\nthe Commonwealth\u2019s Phased Workplace Re-Opening Plan and Authorizing Certain\nRe-Opening Preparations at Phase II Workplaces (the \u201cOrder\u201d). The Order\ntemporarily waives some of the time-consuming procedural requirements for\nrestaurants that are licensed to sell alcoholic beverages for on-premises\nconsumption that are applying to operate outdoor dining services and waives\nthe requirement that the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission approve such\nrequests. The Order also waives zoning requirements that may prohibit outdoor\ndining services. Any approval for outdoor dining services issued pursuant to\nthe Order was in effect only until November 30, 2020. However, on September\n10, 2020, Governor Baker issued an Order Making Certain Phase III Adjustments,\nwhich included extending any approval for restaurants that sell alcoholic\nbeverages to operate outdoor dining services until sixty (60) days past the\nend of the state of emergency or such earlier date that a city or town\nestablishes.  \n  \nPursuant to Governor Baker\u2019s extension of the outdoor dining approvals, the\nCity has likewise extended approvals for outdoor dining until sixty (60) days\npast the end of the state of emergency. The Board of License Commissioners\nvoted to automatically extend all currently issued Temporary Extensions of\nLicensed Premises, and for outdoor dining on City streets and sidewalks, the\nCity has extended all Sidewalk Business Use Permits for outdoor dining and is\namending the term of its License Agreement for restaurants that serve\nalcoholic beverages with outdoor dining until sixty (60) days past the end of\nthe state of emergency.  \n  \nTo allow the City to continue to respond to the restaurant community\u2019s need\nfor outdoor dining in an expeditious manner, I am hereby requesting that the\nCity Council extend its prior authorization for me or my designee to grant\nstreet obstruction approvals, along with any other necessary approvals for\ntemporary obstructions, from November 30, 2020 until sixty (60) days past the\nend of the state of emergency.  \n  \nI look forward to discussing this matter with you and answering any questions\nyou may have.\n\n",

NEIGHBORHOOD & LONG TERM PLANNING,\n\nPUBLIC FACILITIES, ARTS & CELEBRATION\n\nCOMMITTEE MEMBERS\n\nCouncillor Patricia Nolan, Chair\n\nCouncillor Dennis Carlone\n\nVice Mayor Alanna Mallon\n\nCouncillor Marc McGovern\n\nCouncillor Quinton Zondervan\n\n|\n\nIn City Council November 16, 2020  \n  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Neighborhood & Long-Term Planning; Public Facilities, Arts and\nCelebrations Committee held a public hearing on Wednesday, October 7, 2020 at\n2:00 p.m. in the Sullivan Chamber on the reappointment of Christopher Bator to\nthe Cambridge Redevelopment Authority for a term of five years and to discuss\nthe Envision Cambridge citywide plan, and review how to set priorities and\ngoals.\n\nPresent at the hearing were Councillor Nolan, Chair of the Committee, Naomie\nStephen, Executive Assistant to the City Council, and Paula M. Crane, Deputy\nCity Clerk.\n\nPresent via Zoom were Councillor Carlone, Vice Mayor Mallon, Councillor\nZondervan, Councillor Sobrinho-Wheeler, Mayor Siddiqui, Lisa Peterson,\nAssistant City Manager, Iram Farooq, Assistant City Manager for Community\nDevelopment, Chris Cotter, Housing Director, Jeff Roberts, Director of Zoning\nand Development, Melissa Peters, Director of Community Planning, Community\nDevelopment Department (CDD), Anthony Wilson, City Clerk, Tom Evans, Executive\nDirector, Kathleen Born, Chairperson, Board Member, Christopher Bator, Board\nMember, Cambridge Redevelopment Authority (CRA), Catherine Zusy, Cynthia\nHibbard, Doug Brown, Elaine DeRosa, Eric Grunebaum, Heather Hoffman, Henry\nVandermark, James Zall, John Hawkinson, Lee Farris, Marilee Meyer, Marlene\nLundberg, Nancy Ryan, Richard Krushnic and Suzanne Blier.\n\nCouncillor Nolan convened the hearing and read the Call of the Meeting and the\nGovernor\u2019s Executive Order regarding remote participation. She asked for a\nRoll Call to indicate a quorum for the hearing.\n\nThe roll was called and resulted as follows:\n\nPRESENT: Councillor Nolan, Councillor Carlone, and Councillor Zondervan\n\n-3\n\nABSENT: Vice Mayor Mallon and Councillor McGovern -2\n\nand a quorum was present.\n\nCouncillor Nolan opened the hearing to Public Comment.\n\nLee Farris, Cambridge Residents Alliance, read from a prepared written\nstatement (ATTACHMENT A) noting that the Envision plan goals are good overall,\nbut some of them conflict with each other. She asked that the City discuss\ncreating a process on how to resolve conflicting goals.\n\nSuzanne Blier stated that she attended as many meetings as she could, but she\nemphasized that this is not a city plan. She said that the citizens asked for\none and the City hired Utile and then decided that instead of an actual plan\nwe would settle for goals, many of which are contradictory. She said that\nthere is no zoning code or designation of places. She said that there are key\nareas of the city with no plans that have been updated in many years. This has\nopened the City to spot zoning. She asked the City Council to look at the\ncontradictory elements of the plan.\n\nHeather Hoffman, 213 Hurley Street, stated that she is one of the few members\nof the public that attend the CRA meetings. She said that the CRA could teach\nevery other board, commission, and City Council about how to treat the public\nand to encourage the public to take part in their deliberations. She said that\nshe cannot think of a member of the current CRA board that she would be happy\nto see replaced. She said that she would like to see Mr. Bator reappointed.\nShe said that as it relates to Envision, it is a monumental disappointment.\nShe said that it is not a disappointment that the people that the City hired\ndid a lousy job, it is a disappointment because the City administration\nrequired them to do a lousy job. She said that when talking about stability,\nthe fact is that everything the city does undermines stability. She noted that\nthe City Council has become interested in seeing how one particular thing that\nthe city government can do affects rent, how about rampant commercial\ndevelopment with no creation of long-term housing.\n\nCouncillor Nolan made a motion to close Public Comment.\n\nThe roll was called and resulted as follows:\n\nYEAS: Councillor Nolan, Councillor Carlone, Vice Mayor Mallon, and Councillor\nZondervan -4\n\nABSENT: Councillor McGovern -1\n\nand Public Comment was closed at 2:13 p.m.\n\nCouncillor Nolan invited Mr. Evans to briefly provide introduction to the CRA\nBoard process. Mr. Evans noted that the CRA has guided the city through a\ndynamic period. He said that Mr. Bator grew up in Cambridge and has a long\ncareer in government service. He stated that Mr. Bator has been highly\nattentive to the Board\u2019s fiduciary position and has worked hard to ensure that\nresources that they have are extended to facilitate projects throughout the\nCity of Cambridge.  He stated that Mr. Bator has encouraged thoughtful\ninvestment in purchases and other strategic partnerships.\n\nKathy Born added that the last eight years have been a terrific exercise in\nsmall democracy in the City of Cambridge through the CRA. They have been\ncareful in setting goals and measuring accomplishments against those goals.\nShe said that Mr. Bator has been a most conscientious Treasurer. She said that\nas it relates to financial matters, Mr. Bator has been at the helm when the\nCRA was taken over. She said that every member of the CRA are contributing\nmembers. She said that she is happy to continue to work with Mr. Bator.\n\nChristopher Bator stated that he is happy to answer any questions that people\nmay have. He has been deeply honored to serve on the CRA since 2012. He said\nhe is proud of the work that has been done which involved rebuilding the CRA\nfrom Ground Zero. He asserted that the CRA has a very talented and\nprofessional staff. He said that the CRA Board works wonderfully together. He\nnoted that he cares most about trying to move the wealth that exists in\nKendall Square and spread it to important needs across Cambridge.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that the CRA has unique capabilities and that is one\nof the reasons he wants them to get involved in purchase of affordable\nhousing. He said that he is impressed with Mr. Bator. He said that the more\nthe City Council includes the CRA in implementing projects, the better. He\nthanked the CRA Board for its important work.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan stated that he has been impressed by the work of the CRA\nand the number of times that they have been rescuers in difficult situations.\nCouncillor Zondervan asked how we can do more to develop the city in a way\nthat is just and benefits all residents. Mr. Bator stated that he would defer\nto Mr. Evans for a more substantive answer. Mr. Bator said that in his view,\nthey are deeply committed to use the resources and talents of the CRA to\nassist the City, not just in the core responsibilities in Kendall Square. He\nsaid that they are looking for opportunities to do work where there is need.\nHe said that they have had a very significant grassroots strategic planning\neffort in order to ensure that where they choose to use the resources, it is\namong the most important things in the purview of the CRA. He said that the\nCRA seeks guidance from all important entities in the City. Mr. Evans added\nthat the last time that the CRA met with the City Council in February, the CRA\nwas discussing a revisit of their strategic plan. He noted that he looks\nforward to a broader discussion and engage the City Council in this process.\n\nVice Mayor Mallon thanked Mr. Bator for his continued service. She said that\nshe is appreciative of the work of the entire CRA. She said that the City\nCouncil will be drawing on the CRA in the future to get the City through the\nCovid situation to see all the different ways to partner together to help\nthose in the community that are struggling.\n\nCouncillor Nolan said that she is thrilled that Mr. Bator will continue his\nwork. She said that transparency has been a hallmark of the CRA, recently,\nafter a time of trouble and operations that were not transparent and exhibited\npoor practices. She expressed gratitude that the current CRA board corrected\nthose past deficiencies and now is a great example to the rest of the city.\nAnd noted that the Foundry project is a excellent example not yet mentioned of\nthe CRA\u2019s good work\n\nCouncillor Nolan made a motion to forward a favorable recommendation to the\nfull City Council on the reappointment of Christopher Bator to the Cambridge\nRedevelopment Authority for a term of five years.\n\nThe roll was called and resulted as follows:\n\nYEAS: Councillor Nolan, Councillor Carlone, Vice Mayor Mallon, Councillor\nZondervan -4\n\nNAYS: -0\n\nABSENT: Councillor McGovern -1\n\nand the motion passed.\n\nCouncillor Nolan moved to the Envision Cambridge citywide plan. She stated\nthat the background for the meeting is that there have been many hours spent\non Envision with a robust City process that sought to develop a comprehensive\nplanning document for the City. She said that the last meeting of the City\nCouncil on this issue was in December of 2019. She stated that today\u2019s meeting\nis the first step in moving forward and getting the City back on track. She\nsaid that one of hundreds of ideas was the Affordable Housing Overlay which\nbecame a central focus. She said that there are planning goals, focus areas,\n300 action items with 44 priorities. She said that the publication of the\nfinal plan brought together many of the elements into the City from a range of\nareas. She said that we must take a step back and review where Envision landed\nthe City, what has happened since that process. She said that the interim\ndocument was put out in 2017 with a final document in 2019\\. She said that her\nhope is that the committee reviews how Envision is being used and how it is\nshaping the work of the City. She stated that it is important for the City\nCouncil to weigh in.\n\nMs. Farooq stated that she is appreciative of being present when the committee\nis voting on the reappointment of Mr. Bator. She said that the CRA is a\npartner agency to the City and there have been many initiatives and endeavors\nin which they have worked in partnership. She noted that she is pleased to see\npositive feedback and to see him reappointed.\n\nAs it relates to the impact of Covid 19 on Envision, Ms. Farooq said that as\nCDD has looked at, it is a long-term plan that has not been changed\nsignificantly by Covid. She said that it does shine a stronger light on some\nof the elements, particularly in the last 6-7 months such as community health,\nsocial equity, and racial equity. She said that CDD has been focused over the\nlast several months on the response to the pandemic such as supporting\nresidents and businesses. She said it was interesting for CDD to pivot back to\nthe long-term planning mode in preparation for this hearing. She noted that\nCDD did not ask partner departments to be present for the hearing but their\nfeedback is incorporated into the materials that CDD sent out earlier this\nweek that includes updates on each of the topic areas in terms action status.\nShe said that in terms of the prioritization process with Envision Cambridge\nand each of the topic areas, it is more of a framework for how to move forward\nin each endeavor. In looking at all the action items and working with the\ncommunity and the working groups, they went through a process of\nprioritization to determine higher priority items and particularly which were\nshort term versus long term. She said that at today\u2019s meeting they are\nfocusing on the high priority, short-term actions. Within that ,they have\ntried to keep maximum flexibility. She said that in terms of the work that is\ntaken up by CDD each year is what the particular needs of the moment are. In\nterms of what would be most useful to staff from today\u2019s discussion, Ms.\nFarooq noted that being able to understand what is important to the City\nCouncil and the community is very helpful as they move toward the budgeting\nprocess.  Ms. Farooq introduced Community Development staff and invited\nMelissa Peters to give a summary of the materials that were sent to the\nCommittee (ATTACHMENT B).\n\nMs. Peters gave an overview which stated that Envision Cambridge is a roadmap\nto the year 2030, setting out a course of action to promote inclusive and\nsustainable growth. She noted that the plan recommends 37 Goals, 42\nstrategies, and 176 new actions across six planning topics: climate and\nenvironment, community wellbeing, economy, housing, mobility and urban form.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that he appreciates the update. He reminded everyone\nthat he co-wrote the Policy Order and it was a struggle to get it approved. He\nsaid that it was planning and urban design yet when he looked at the urban\nform section, there were guidelines but there were no urban design massing\nstudies, height studies or open space studies. He does not know how you do\nzoning without an urban design analysis. He said that this baffles him. Ms.\nFarooq addressed in the Urban Form section many of the priority areas and\naction items that will get to the specific urban design recommendations that\nCouncillor Carlone is speaking of. For example, one of the recommendations is\ntaking a closer look at the Inman Square area and what development patterns\nthere might look like, particularly as impacted by the Green Line extension.\nShe said that as we delve into that level of plan, that will be more granular\nand would incorporate more detailed urban design input that Councillor Carlone\nis referring to. Councillor Carlone said that all the commercial districts\nneed to be studied. He said that it is not on the list and if you are going to\ndo that, add it.  He said that urban design will study conflicts. Councillor\nCarlone said that a confusing thing to him is that Envision they mandated an\nurban design study of Alewife. A site plan was done. He asked if that is the\nAlewife plan? Ms. Peters responded that when they refer to the Alewife\nDistrict Plan, it is the plan that came out of the Envision process that Utile\nhelped with. She said that if it is in reference to current zoning, the\nexisting Concord Alewife of 2010 is still the plan on the book. She said that\nas they have spoken with developers in the community, they have been pushing\nthe goals and community aspirations from the new Alewife plan into the\nconversation. Councillor Carlone said that is priority one given the we are\ngetting development proposals.\n\nCouncillor Carlone said that starting a study could be three meetings. He\nnoted that he would like a schedule of when things will be done. He said that\nit would be great to say, \u201cThese 3 should be done in 6 months.\u201d He said that\nwe are well past starting. He stated that starting is a good thing but\nliterally it does not really say anything. Ms. Farooq explained that the one\nreason they referenced everything to starting rather than concluding is\nbecause a large percentage of the actions are ongoing actions. She said that\nsome actions will never be complete. She said that there are things that will\nhave a start and end such as open space planning updates. She said that a\nlarger set of actions are ongoing items that will not be completed so that is\nwhy they linked everything to starting the work. Councillor Carlone said that\nthere is no idea how far along the work is. He said that words are not a plan,\nwords are not a strategy. He said it would be great to receive updates every\n3-6 months, specifically on what is being currently worked on and what is\nbeing accomplished.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan thanked the staff for the update and added his voice to\nthe call for more regular updates and the addition of dashboards. He stated\nthat the Committee heard about conflicts between different roles and one way\nto address the issue is do holistic planning. He said what is great about\nEnvision Cambridge is that the first step in holistic planning has been\naccomplished. He said that the next step is to evaluate our actions against\nall the goals. He stated that a lot of actions are driven by developers who\nbuy property and then come to the City Council. He said that if we were having\na more robust discussion in the context of Envision, we would take those\nproposals and air them to Envision. He said that the public should not feel so\nleft out and powerless. He said that there needs to be more effort into\nevaluating plans and decision going forward against these goals. He said that\nwe do not seem to be going through any kind of guided exercise that says how\nto adjust the zoning to move forward in a way to accomplish goals. He said\nthat there are constantly individual issues that ensue an argument when we\nshould evaluate all issues against zoning and goals and then see how zoning\ncan be more aligned with goals. He asked how we create a real planning process\nbased on goals developed through Envision that produces a plan through zoning\nthat lays out what we are going to do where in the city. Ms. Farooq said that\nas it relates to a dashboard, they are working on putting together a direct\ndashboard and are now in conversation with IT Department to figure out how to\ndo the technical work and get it on CDD\u2019s website. She said that it will take\nseveral months, and the hope is to have it available sometime next year. In\nterms of zoning and evaluation actions, Ms. Farooq said that there are actions\nthat are identified, and it is easy to proceed one by one through these. She\nsaid it is more challenging when it is a development or rezoning proposal. At\nthe staff level they built in that thinking into it, but they do not\nspecifically do holistic planning. She said that they could utilize that\nmethod. She asked Jeff Robert to add to this. She said that there are two ways\nto think about how to take the conceptual citywide plan and translate that\ninto zoning and it is not a small exercise. She said that the alternative is\nto take every proposal before CDD (whether coming from staff, the City\nCouncil, residents or developers) and then sieve it through the sift of\nEnvision and see what the picture looks like. She said that we must pick one\npath or the other. She said that she would appreciate guidance. Mr. Roberts\nsaid that in terms of overall strategy, it is important to establish planning\ngoals and then evaluate the policies, including the Zoning Ordinance, to\nunderstand how that aligns with goals. He said that much of that work has been\ndone in the Envision Cambridge plan. There are 30 specific actions that\nrelated to zoning. He said that one approach to tackling those is to\nprioritize and to work through them in some order. He said that the\nalternative approach is to say, \u201cPut everything else on hold so we can do a\nfully comprehensive reconsideration of the whole Zoning Ordinance which can\nhave benefit, but it will take a lot of time.\u201d He said that approach of\nfocusing efforts on things that we want accomplished the most is a good\nstrategy but if we want to take a different tact, we could but it would come\nwith a lot of tradeoffs.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan stated that he is conflicted because he understands the\nchallenge and yet at the same time, he thinks how can we not do both things.\nHe said that he struggles to reconcile these two approaches. Ms. Farooq said\nthat when thinking about capacity and that as a constraining factor, it is not\njust if CDD has enough staff in the zoning division, it is also if there is\nenough staff in other department who are analyzing each of the components. She\nsaid it is a mushroom as well as capacity at Planning Board, Ordinance\nCommittee, etc. She said that making changes incrementally has served us quite\nwell.\n\nVice Mayor Mallon stated that as it relates to staff capacity, she would love\nto see a dashboard of the Envision goals and actions and where we are on each\none of them. She said that she wonders about staff capacity to do something\nlike that. She asked if we should entertain the idea of hiring someone outside\nto put together a dashboard. She said that she would like to think about how\nto make that come to fruition without adding burden onto CDD. As it relates to\nregular progress reports, she stated that she has some questions. She wondered\nif they could be updated. She asked if there is a way to update progress\nreports via color-coding with a small blurb of what is happening. Something\nthat would indicate where we are in the absence of a dashboard would be\nhelpful. Vice Mayor Mallon asked if there is there a way to use the committees\nto move work forward. She asked how the City Council committee chairs can have\nmore of a partner with action items and move them forward in that way. Ms.\nFarooq said that it is a great idea. She said it is a key way to build two-way\ncommunication around specific topics and actions. She said that the committees\ngrapple with the same kind of restraint in doing multiple things at the same\ntime. She welcomes that partnership. Vice Mayor Mallon asked if there is a way\nthat progress reports could be updated to show a visual representation of\nwhere the work stands. Ms. Farooq said that they will do the updates. Ms.\nFarooq asked Ms. Peters to provide a sense of how long this will take. She\nstated that we must keep in mind that more detailed updates involve more\ndepartments than CDD. She said that they will work on it and maybe take the\napproach of sending them forward as they are done. Ms. Peters added that they\ncan color code the actions to correspond to the pie chart but if more detail\nis added they will have to reach out to staff and department heads which would\ntake more time. She said that CDD can send color coding first and then as they\ngo through each planning topic, they will forward to the City Council.\n\nCouncillor Nolan said that we have talked about dashboards and she believed\nthat they are in the process. Ms. Farooq said that it is in the process and\nshe does not believe additional resources are necessary. Ms. Peters said that\nthere is a fulltime senior planner that is charged in the Envision\nimplementation and moving to forward. He is getting the data organized to\ntrack the indicators to ultimately go onto a dashboard. The next step is the\nweb design and development phase. In the interim, progress reports will fill\nthe gaps. Councillor Nolan said that the data is already partly there but it\nis not tied to the actual item so that has been challenging. She stated that\nother data would not have to be gathered. She said that we could use the\nsustainability platform and use for other categories. Melissa Peters stated\nthat the intention is to use the City\u2019s web infrastructure for Envision so\nthey have more control over updates.  Councillor Nolan stated that she would\nlike a timeline prospectively for actions to the completion or next steps of\naction items. Ms. Farooq responded that they aim to create the pool of\npriority items but retain the flexibility to be responsive to the needs of\neach item. She said that it is hard to ascribe timelines that go beyond the\nfiscal year unless it is to an item that is an ongoing item or an item that\nthey have started. She said that for the items that have begun, they could try\nto layout a timeline guideline, but it will be challenging and difficult to\nsay that for all the other items that have not begun, when they would begin.\nCouncillor Nolan said that actions are related to strategies which are tied to\na goal and the goals are long-term. She said that there are some goals that\nare longer term.\n\nCouncillor Nolan stated that the Envision document should be all of the City\nCouncil and City staff guiding document to keep the focus on all of the goals\nthat are encompassed. She said that as it relates to the various working\ngroups and department heads, is there anything that the City Council should be\nthinking about moving forward. Ms. Farooq said that the key conversation that\nhas been had with department heads have been around action items and ensuring\nthat they are attaching updates. In terms of what would be most useful, Ms.\nFarooq said that the most useful feedback is to have clear priorities of the\nCity Council as a body. In terms of the working groups, she said that they\nwere informed about this discussion. Ms. Peters said that they were notified\nof the hearing today and some members indicated that they would be listening\nin. She noted that since December 2018, CDD has not regrouped with the working\ngroups.\n\nCouncillor Nolan said that this is a good start for her. She said it is a\ndocument that could be more specific. She noted that there has been some\nfrustration about the range of actions. She said that it would make sense for\nthe Committee to recommend to the full City Council that the work continue in\nthe committees that are set up around these areas.\n\nCouncillor Nolan made the following motion:\n\nORDERED: That the Neighborhood and Long-Term Planning Committee, Public\nFacilities, Arts and Celebrations Committee recommend to the full City Council\nthat a response to each of the six areas of the Envision plan to include\nholding committee meetings on each of the planning topics as they are updated\nand ready to be discussed, be referred to respective committees related to the\ngoals and plans as follows:\n\nClimate and Environment to the Health and Environment Committee\n\nCommunity Wellbeing to the Civic Unity Committee\n\nEconomy to the Economic Development and University Relations Committee\n\nHousing to the Housing Committee\n\nMobility to the Transportation & Public Utilities Committee\n\nUrban Form to the Neighborhood and Long Term Planning, Public Facilities, Arts\nand Celebrations Committee\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that he agrees with the Councillor Nolan\u2019s motion.\nHe said that this was tried before the final report came out when it was in\ndraft form, but it was not completely successful. He said that this is the\nright next step. He said that CDD has both a long-term planning and\ninstantaneous response responsibility that the City Council asks for things\nand the City Council expects it yesterday. He said that this department is the\nmost unique in that way. He said that it makes sense and it might be a way to\nhelp staff understand the point of view of the City Council.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan stated that the City Council can set a goal as a City\nCouncil to have a process to change City Councils to reflect the Envision\ngoals. He said that there is a discrepancy between the current City Council\ngoals and the Envision goals and maybe that is the place to start as a body to\ndo this work.\n\nCouncillor Nolan asked Councillor Zondervan if he was proposing adding\nlanguage to the motion or would that be a separate meeting. Councillor\nZondervan responded that the Committee can recommend to the full City Council\nto initiate a process to look at the current City Council goals and look at\nthe Envision goals and decide on City Council goals going forward rather than\nperpetuating the current discrepancies.\n\nCouncillor Nolan stated that the words \u201cthat it work on establishing long-term\ngoals\u201d could be added to the motion in the first paragraph. Councillor\nZondervan stated that this works but he suggested changing the word\n\u201cestablish\u201d to the word \u201cupdating.\u201d\n\nVice Mayor Mallon asked the Chair to re-read the amended wording for the\nmotion.\n\nCouncillor Nolan read the following motion:\n\nORDERED: That the Neighborhood and Long-Term Planning Committee, Public\nFacilities, Arts and Celebrations Committee recommend to the full City Council\nthat it update its goals and that a response to each of the six areas of the\nEnvision plan to include holding committee meetings on each of the planning\ntopics as they are updated and ready to be discussed, be referred to\nrespective committees related to the goals and plans as follows:\n\nClimate and Environment to the Health and Environment Committee\n\nCommunity Wellbeing to the Civic Unity Committee\n\nEconomy to the Economic Development and University Relations Committee\n\nHousing to the Housing Committee\n\nMobility to the Transportation & Public Utilities Committee\n\nUrban Form to the Neighborhood and Long Term Planning, Public Facilities, Arts\nand Celebrations Committee\n\nVice Mayor Mallon suggested that a motion be made to extend the meeting by 10\nminutes.\n\nCouncillor Nolan made a motion to extend the hearing for 10 minutes.\n\nThe roll was called and resulted as follows:\n\nYEAS: Councillor Nolan, Councillor Carlone, Vice Mayor Mallon, Councillor\nZondervan -4\n\nNAYS: -0\n\nABSENT: Councillor McGovern -1\n\nand the motion passed on the affirmative vote of four members.\n\nVice Mayor Mallon said that she is uncomfortable to speak about the City\nCouncil goals in this setting. She said that she is comfortable moving forward\nwith the motion by Councillor Nolan. She stated that if we want to City\nCouncil goals, she believes that it should happen in a different committee and\nshe believes that Mayor Siddiqui had spoken about a treat at some point to\ntalk about goals. She said she is not comfortable combining those two things.\nShe said that the Committee should focus on moving progress to the committees\nas originally suggested.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan responded that the Committee is not suggesting to the\nCity Council what to do other than to initiate a process to evaluate its\nupdated goals.\n\nCouncillor Carlone said that we are only talking about planning goals, not the\nCity Council\u2019s twelve goals that will probably be refined in the next few\nmonths. He said that we are talking as it relates to Envision and it is a\nPolicy Order that will be discussed by the full City Council. He said that\nthis is a good discussion.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan stated that the City Council should update its goals but\nexactly how we want to go about that is a topic for another discussion. He\nsaid that he is just saying that we should look at the goals.\n\nCouncillor Nolan stated her agreement with Vice Mayor Mallon that these should\nbe two separate motions. She stated that she would like to vote on her\noriginally proposed motion which reads as follows:\n\nORDERED: That the Neighborhood and Long-Term Planning Committee, Public\nFacilities, Arts and Celebrations Committee recommend to the full City Council\nthat a response to each of the six areas of the Envision plan to include\nholding committee meetings on each of the planning topics as they are updated\nand ready to be discussed, be referred to respective committees related to the\ngoals and plans as follows:\n\nClimate and Environment to the Health and Environment Committee\n\nCommunity Wellbeing to the Civic Unity Committee\n\nEconomy to the Economic Development and University Relations Committee\n\nHousing to the Housing Committee\n\nMobility to the Transportation & Public Utilities Committee\n\nUrban Form to the Neighborhood and Long Term Planning, Public Facilities, Arts\nand Celebrations Committee\n\nThe roll was called and resulted as follows:\n\nYEAS: Councillor Nolan, Councillor Carlone, Vice Mayor Mallon, Councillor\nZondervan -4\n\nNAYS: -0\n\nABSENT: Councillor McGovern -1\n\nand the motion passed on the affirmative vote of four members.\n\nCouncillor Nolan asked Councillor Zondervan if he would like to submit another\nmotion. Councillor Zondervan responded in the negative.\n\nCouncillor Nolan thanked all those present for their attendance.\n\nCouncillor Nolan made a motion for adjournment.\n\nThe roll was called and resulted as follows:\n\nYEAS: Councillor Nolan, Councillor Carlone, Vice Mayor Mallon, Councillor\nZondervan -4\n\nNAYS: -0\n\nABSENT: Councillor McGovern -1\n\nand the motion passed on the affirmative vote of four members.\n\nThe meeting adjourned at 4:08 p.m.\n\nFor the Committee,\n\n________________________________\n\nCouncillor Patricia Nolan, Chair\n\nNeighborhood & Long-Term Planning;\n\nPublic Facilities, Arts and Celebrations Committee\n\n",

Below you will find information requested by the Ordinance Committee relative\nto draft alternative language to the Green Energy Analysis Zoning Petition,\nreceived from Assistant City Manager for Community Development Iram Farooq and\nCity Solicitor Nancy E. Glowa.  \n  \nOverview  \n  \nFollowing the August 26, 2020 hearing on the above-referenced zoning petition,\nthe Ordinance Committee asked CDD to suggest revised language in response to\nthe Planning Board recommendation dated August 19, 2020 and CDD staff\ncomments. Staff from the Division of Zoning and Development and the Division\nof Environmental and Transportation Planning worked together, in consultation\nwith the Law Department, to draft alternative language that retains the intent\nof the petition, provides clearer guidance, and is better integrated into\ncurrent zoning.  \n  \nAs with the current petition, the suggested language would add a component to\nthe \u201cNet Zero Narrative\u201d requiring applicants to submit an assessment of the\ntechnical feasibility and cost of installation of \u201cfossil fuel free\u201d energy\nsystems as part of a project subject to Green Building Requirements. The Net\nZero Narrative is a public document that is made available to the Planning\nBoard and the public for advisory review when projects require special\npermits. The revised language is intended to describe the scope of the\nassessment more clearly, to ensure that developers provide clear and\nconsistent information in a way that relates to other components of the Net\nZero Narrative.  \n  \nSuggested Language  \n  \nInsert a new Paragraph 22.25.1 (c) (6) in the \u201cNet Zero Narrative\u201d submission\nrequirements to read as follows:  \n\n\u201c(6) an assessment of energy systems that do not consume fossil fuels on-site\n(to include solar photovoltaics and hot water, ground source, water source or\nair source heat pumps, district energy systems, and/or similar systems) that\nexamines technical feasibility to meet the projected HVAC and domestic hot\nwater demands of the building based on the information provided in\n22.25.1(c)(2), and cost of installation taking into account incentives\nprovided in 22.25.1(c)(5), all compared to code-compliant energy systems that\nconsume fossil fuels on-site.\u201d  \n\nBecause such an assessment requires time to complete before a final\napplication can be submitted, staff recommends that this additional paragraph\ntake effect 90 days after the date of adoption. That way, development\nproposals that are early in the pre-application review process can begin to\nincorporate this requirement immediately, but proposals that are in the later\nstages of review will not be unreasonably affected.\n\n",

Due in large part to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and resultant\ndecrease in parking meter revenues, the Parking Fund revenues for the Traffic,\nParking and Transportation Department have suffered significantly this year.\nAccordingly, I am writing to request that you approve the increase of the fee\nfor a Resident Parking Permit/Pass from $25.00 to $40.00, by amending the\nprovisions of Chapter 10, Section 10.17.070 of the Municipal Code. The current\nfee of $25.00 per Resident Parking Permit/Pass was established effective with\n2013 permits. The fee has historically been adjusted from time to time as\ncosts rise, and this type of change is also in keeping with our overall\ntransportation and sustainability goals. The $40.00 fee more accurately\nreflects current costs. I request that consideration be given so that if\napproved, the City could implement this change prior to the 2021 renewal\nseason, which effectively starts on December 1, 2020 when the City opens the\npermit application portal.  \n  \nThe proposed amendment to the applicable provisions of the Municipal Code is\nattached for your consideration.

October 28, 2020\n\nMr. Anthony Wilson\n\nClerk of Cambridge\n\nCambridge City Hall\n\nRe: Memo Re Cambridge Brands Curb Cut\n\nDear Mr. Wilson:\n\nI am submitting this letter for inclusion on the November 2, 2020 City Council\nmeeting\n\nagenda. I exercised my Charter Right on the curb cut request by Cambridge\nBrands during the\n\nOctober 19, 2020 City Council meeting, and during the October 26 City Council\nmeeting, I\n\nreferenced an email exchange between myself, Paula Yetman from Cambridge\nBrands, and Charles\n\nDoty from Cambridge Brands that took place following the October 19th meeting.\nI am submitting\n\nthat email exchange as part of this communication so that my colleagues can\nbetter understand what I\n\nwas referencing last week.\n\nFor further clarification: during the October 19th City Council meeting, I\nbrought forward\n\nsome legitimate concerns about the level of outreach conducted by Cambridge\nBrands to its\n\nneighbors, as well as the overall level of civic engagement by this company\nduring those times when\n\nthey are not seeking something from the City. The reason I exercised my\ncharter right, and the reason\n\nI have sought additional time before we vote on this matter, is because I\nwished to learn more about\n\nthe company\u2019s community outreach, and I have been reaching out to numerous\npeople that live near\n\nthe Cambridge Brands building. Following the October 19th Council meeting, I\nsent an email to Paula\n\nYetman, the Plant Manager, as well as to Cambridge Brands attorney Charles\nDoty, underlining my\n\nconcerns and seeking to open a dialogue with them ahead of the next Council\nmeeting.\n\nInterestingly, Mr. Doty shared a little more with me than he intended to when\nhe accidentally\n\ncopied me on an email that was meant only for Ms. Yetman and their Cambridge\nBrands colleagues.\n\nIn that email, he said \u201cGood job! [Councilor Simmons] has surrendered and\nchanged the topic in\n\norder to save face. You need to respond with humility and sweetness, telling\nher that Cambridge\n\nBrands looks forward to working with her and continuing to participate as an\nactive member of the\n\nCambridge Community and the Main Street neighborhood.\u201d Within an hour of\nsending that email,\n\nboth Ms. Yetman and Mr. Doty realized what had happened and sent me profusely\napologetic emails\n\nsaying that this email should not have been sent, that no disrespect was\nintended, and so on.\n\nAnd while I appreciate the apologies - the email that Mr. Doty had sent to me\nby accident\n\nreveals that he viewed this discussion as something of a game. And I want to\nmake it clear: I don\u2019t\n\nview these curb cut discussions, or discussions about civic engagement and the\nrole of a responsible\n\ncorporate neighbor, as being frivolous. I do not view this as a game.\nCambridge Brands has been in\n\nthis community for generations, they are looking for expand, and I think\nthat\u2019s wonderful - but I also\n\nwant to know how they fit into our community, aside from simply having a\nphysical location here.\n\nDo they feel any ties to the community? Any obligation to recruit locally for\nemployment? Any ties\n\nto our student population? I think those are fair questions, and those are the\nkinds of points I\u2019ve been\n\nseeking clarity on.\n\nAs I told Ms. Yetman in my initial email, I am not trying to prevent this\ncompany from\n\nexpanding, but I do want to know more about how they view their relationship\nwith the People of\n\nCambridge. How do they plan to stay engaged with their neighborhood even after\nthey receive this\n\ncurb cut, if that comes to pass? I am still interested in having that\nconversation, and it\u2019s something I\n\nwould hope every company operating in this city is continually thinking about.\nThank you.\n\nSincerely,\n\n__________________________\n\nCity Councilor E. Denise Simmons\n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCITY HALL, CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS 02139\n\n(617) 349-4280 FAX: (617) 349-4287 TTY/TDD: (617) 349-4242 EMAIL:\ndsimmons@cambridgema.gov\n\n",

This is the\n[presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1uIflcKCFbQ5wbU82xF_QnU2xevVLeVro8EuI22fWrD4/edit)\nprovided by CPSD and some of the principals attending. We learned that while\nthat students are greatly benefiting from in-person education, educators and\nleadership are struggling with time management and are feeling spread thin due\nto staffing challenges. It was important to hear about their successes and\nchallenges and I look forward to working with them as we move ahead.\n\nOn Wednesday, October 28th, the [Special Education and Student Supports\nSubcommittee](https://www.cpsd.us/UserFiles/Servers/Server_3042785/File/school_committee/notices/2020/10-28-2020_SC_SESS_subcom_notice.pdf)\nconvened and heard from OSS leadership as well as special educators. We heard\nmany similar themes\u2014while educators cited that students are thrilled to be\nback in a much-needed in-person environment, that they face insufficient time\nto effectively plan key efforts or to complete necessary paperwork, such as\nlesson planning, attendance logging, IEP documentation, evaluations, and\nparent engagement information. Educators continue to express that they are\nworking extremely hard and are stretched with staff shortages. The OSS team\nshared that their next steps are to work with caregivers to plan for expanded\nhybrid in-person services and aim to get all students with IEPs back in school\nfor the winter.\n\nThis year\u2019s JK/K Lottery info sessions will be Zoom webinars and are scheduled\nto take place on Wednesday, November 18th 6:00-7:00 PM and Saturday November\n21st 10:00-11:00 AM. Please find more information\n[here](https://www.cpsd.us/administration/src/registering_for/january_kindergarten_lottery).\n\nCPSD will be submitting its annual enrollment report to the Department of\nElementary and Secondary Education in early November. While there may be some\nminor adjustments between now and then, the current data shows that there has\nbeen an overall enrollment decline of 5.6% (402 students) this school year.\nThis enrollment decline is the first since the 2006-07 school year and ends 13\nconsecutive years of enrollment growth. Prior to the pandemic, enrollment had\nbeen projected to increase by approximately 2.5%.\n\nOn Thursday, October 29th, my School Committee colleagues and I joined a\nspecial event with CPS scholars called \u201cMeet the School Committee\u201d, hosted by\nour Student Members Anais Killian and Nuriel Vera-DeGraff. It is important for\nour community, including our students to understand the role of the School\nCommittee and for us to be available to answer their questions.\n\nAs I mentioned last week, I have been supporting the CRLS #HerVote club\u2019s\n[#HerVote](https://long19.radcliffe.harvard.edu/projects/hervote/hervote-\ninstructions/) project (in partnership with the Radcliffe Institute). If you\nhaven\u2019t already, I encourage you all to also download and print [this\ntemplate](http://schlesinger.radcliffe.harvard.edu/onlinecollections/long19th-\nproject/files/hervote_template.pdf), to write your own response, and share it\nwith us on Twitter and Instagram with the hashtag #HerVote in this very last\nstretch before the November 3rd election.\n\nWe had a great turnout at our last Family Resource Fair on Saturday, October\n24th on the Cambridge Public Library lawn. We are planning to hold one more\nFair in November\u2014stay tuned for more information.\n\nFinally, I am excited to announce that Elevate Youth, the WorkForce Program,\nand my Office are extending the Local Parks Program for another 3 weeks\nthrough November 18th. Due to daylight savings, programming will run from\n2:30-4:30 PM (instead of 3:30-5:30 PM) on Mondays and Wednesdays at Danehy\nPark. If you have or know of a 4th or 5th grader who would benefit from social\nand emotional learning activities centered around structured time in the\noutdoors, please have them submit an\n[application](https://gcc02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fforms%2Fd%2Fe%2F1FAIpQLSd_w0gDQCkuMkYsuimMbcAUwyinSwRBXT20fYHUPOeXIuOaqg%2Fviewform&data=02%7C01%7Cbkim%40cambridgema.gov%7C70b63b6227b14082193408d86571ca73%7Cc06a8be784794d73b35193bc9ba8295c%7C0%7C1%7C637370886716602683&sdata=GfaMzh3N865DYO9oEISOZXe2Uq1Q%2FPAEV9C5RfiEJgA%3D&reserved=0)\nASAP.

I am hereby requesting the appropriation of $921,062 from Free Cash to the\nPublic Investment Fund, Emergency Communications Extraordinary Expenditures\naccount to procure a new Records Management System (RMS).  \n  \nThe RMS is managed by the Public Safety Information Technology (PSIT) Division\nof the Emergency Communications Department. Funds will be used to purchase a\nnew Police RMS to replace the current system which has been in place since\n1996. The new RMS will better align with the long-term operational needs of\nthe Police Department and will enhance reporting and investigation\ncapabilities as well as increase accountability, compliance and transparency\nby capturing valuable data regarding officer\u2019s day to day activities in the\ncommunity.\n\nIn support of the city and Police Department\u2019s mission of improved\ntransparency, the proposed RMS will include a Procedural Justice module that\nwill enable the department to automate statistical analysis of motor\nvehicle/field stops and behavioral crisis reporting, and provide police\nleadership and the public an opportunity to view the data in near real-time.\nEventually, the system will afford the opportunity of statistical analysis of\nuse of force reporting as well.\n\nThe new RMS will allow the Police Department to maintain core values of the\ndepartment, utilize a more intuitive system to increase productivity, provide\ntransparency on actions in the community, demonstrate impartiality in decision\nmaking, and create further opportunities for community engagement.\n\nThe Police Department will also continue efforts to enhance accountability,\nensure department compliance with policies and identify training opportunities\non trends in the community and for those officers needing additional resources\nor support.\n\nThis project has been reviewed pursuant to the requirements of the\nSurveillance Ordinance and it has been determined that the replacement RMS is\ncovered under the existing Surveillance Technology Impact Report (STIR) that\nwas approved for the Police Department\u2019s current RMS.\n\n",

DePasquale, City Manager, relative to Awaiting Report Item Number 20-32, regarding the feasibility of identifying one evening or day per week that the Fresh Pond Golf Course can be open to the public for general use. The City Council has requested that the City explore the feasibility of\nopening the Golf Course for general recreational use for one day or one\nevening during the week. During the golf season, the golf course is heavily\nused by both adults and young people for playing golf. With the restrictions\nfor COVID-19 health and safety, there has been a significant limitation on the\nnumber of golfers each day and closing down for a day or evening would further\nlimit play. During the golf season, allowing users besides golfers on the\ncourse would cause several problems. First, it would further reduce the time\nthat golfer would be able to play. Second, because it is possible to access\nthe golf course not just through the main path from the clubhouse, walkers,\nrunners and dog walkers may be entering the golf course while play is\nhappening putting themselves at risk because they are not certain which day or\nevening the course is open to them. There have been times when families or\nindividuals have wandered onto the course because of the attraction as they\nwalk around fresh pond. Third, the course is certified as an Audubon\nCooperative Sanctuary using environmental practices that support water\nconservation, quality and wildlife habitat management. This requires that the\ngolf course staff remain particularly vigilant during the playing season to\nmaintain the course.  \n  \nIn West Cambridge, there are other alternatives for walkers and runners\nbecause of the proximity of Danehy Park. Once the Golf Course closes for the\nseason which will happen depending on the weather sometime in December,\nwalkers, runners and cross country skiers are all welcome on the course. While\nthat use can cause minor damage to the course, the staff are able to manage\nand maintain the course and close off limited areas only when the greens or\nbunkers are getting damaged.\n\n",

DePasquale, City Manager, relative to the appropriation of $5,000,000 from Free Cash to the Public Investment Fund Executive Department Extraordinary Expenditures Account for the City's third annual contribution to the MBTA Green Line Extension project. I am hereby requesting an appropriation of $5,000,000 from Free Cash to the\nPublic Investment Fund Executive Department Extraordinary Expenditures\naccount, for the City\u2019s third annual contribution to the Massachusetts Bay\nTransportation Authority (MBTA) Green Line Extension (GLX) project. This\npayment will bring the City\u2019s total contribution to this critical project to\n$15 million of the total of $25 million that we agreed to contribute, half of\nwhich will be provided through our partnership with DivcoWest relative to the\nCambridge Crossing development. Two additional $5 million contributions will\nbe due in the fall of 2021 and the fall of 2022, at which point we will have\nsatisfied our funding commitment to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  \n  \nAs documented in the previous appropriation letters from January 2018 and\nOctober 2019, the GLX project has significant benefits to the City of\nCambridge:  \n\n\u00b7 Construction of a new Lechmere Station to replace the recently demolished\nfacility, which was obsolete, in poor condition, and not fully accessible for\nthose with disabilities.\n\n\u00b7 Creation of frequent and reliable service from sections of Somerville and\nMedford that are currently not easily accessible by public transportation. The\nGLX will serve trips from these locations into the key employment centers\nlocated in eastern Cambridge, as well as trips to Boston that pass through\nCambridge. This will help to reduce the number of cars driving to and through\nCambridge, helping us meet our transportation and environmental objectives.\n\n\u00b7 Assisting in meeting the City\u2019s and the region\u2019s mobility, sustainability,\nand economic development goals.  \n\nAccording to the GLX program management team, the project is advancing on\nschedule and on budget and is on track to be completed within the overall\nproject budget of $2.3 billion. The project recently passed the 50% completion\nmilestone and service to the general public is currently slated to begin by\nthe end of 2021. COVID-19 has exacerbated the already tight construction\nschedule, and the GLX team is particularly focused on determining the impacts\nof critical supply chain challenges and developing mitigation strategies where\npossible.  \n\nAs documented in the photos attached, the GLX project has made significant\nprogress on construction:\n\n\u00b7 The project is well along in construction of the new Lechmere Station and\nthe replacement of the viaduct adjacent to Cambridge Crossing/North Point. The\nexisting viaduct-including the connection across Monsignor O\u2019Brien Highway-was\ndemolished earlier this year and placement of steel beams for the new viaduct\nis largely complete, as shown in Photograph 1. As part of this work, a \u201cbus\nbridge\u201d is in place to move riders between Lechmere and North Station,\nincluding dedicated bus lanes on Monsignor O\u2019Brien Highway to minimize the\ndelays for passengers using the buses.\n\n\u00b7 Construction is also well underway at the other six new Green Line stations\nin Somerville and Medford.\n\n\u00b7 The extension of the viaduct to connect to the two branches in Somerville\nand Medford is also making significant progress, as shown in Photograph 2.\n\n\u00b7 The Community Path connection from Somerville into Cambridge Crossing/North\nPoint is being built as part of the GLX project, including the bridge that\nbrings the Community Path across the GLX alignment near the\nCambridge/Somerville border, as shown in Photograph 3.\n\n\u00b7 23 of the 24 new Type 9 Green Line trains have been delivered. These\nadditional train sets are necessary to extend rail service along the GLX.\n\n\u00b7 Construction is progressing on the Vehicle Maintenance Building where trains\nwill be stored and serviced, as shown in Photograph 4.  \n\nOf the project\u2019s overall $2.3 billion budget, approximately $1.3 billion has\nbeen expended, and the project is employing the equivalent of 800 people\nacross Cambridge, Somerville, and Medford.  \n\nCity staff continue to be heavily involved in reviewing and commenting on the\ndesign of the improvements within Cambridge, as well as the impacts on City\nstreets and utilities. The project has hosted 32 consecutive monthly Community\nWorking Group meetings since late 2017, which are attended by representatives\nfrom Cambridge, as well as from Somerville and Medford. In addition, staff\ncontinue to review designs and construction documents, assess utility impacts,\ncoordinate with nearby construction projects, and assist in publicizing\nupcoming construction work and the resulting impacts.  \n\nBased on the progress to date, the project continues to meet the requirements\nlaid out in the Project Participation Agreement (PPA) between the City of\nCambridge, the MBTA, and the Massachusetts Department of Transportation. As a\nresult, I remain confident that the funds being contributed to the GLX project\nare being spent responsibly and for the purposes laid out in the PPA, and I am\npleased to request this appropriation to continue our partnership with the\nstate and the MBTA.\n\n",

      "full_text": " A communication transmitted from Louis A. DePasquale, City Manager, relative to Awaiting Report Item Number 20-49, regarding a report on the feasibility of closing several blocks of streets in Harvard Square to vehicular traffic, with the exception of deliveries. In response to Awaiting Report Item Number 20-49, regarding a report on the\nfeasibility of closing several blocks of streets in Harvard Square to\nvehicular traffic, with the exception of deliveries, Traffic, Parking &\nTransportation Director Joseph Barr reports the following:  \n  \nOverall, the City is supportive of implementing street closures on weekends\nand possibly weeknights when they help support the vitality of local\nbusinesses and the Harvard Square neighborhood. In any such effort, we need to\nbe sensitive to the specific needs of these groups and ensure that any changes\nrecognize and respond to their operations. Implementation of any street\nclosures would need to be done in a manner that increases the attractiveness\nof the area. This typically requires programming and activation to attract\npositive activity and prevent the area from looking empty or inactive.  \n  \nIt is worth keeping in mind that activation that encourages people to\ncongregate would have to be undertaken with caution while we are dealing with\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. Active stewardship of such spaces is important at all\ntimes, but particularly during the pandemic, to support and safely manage such\nactivation. This is key to ensuring that changes help support the overall\nsafety of the Harvard Square area, from the perspective of traffic safety,\npublic health, and overall public safety. Locations where abutting restaurants\nor other businesses are interested in utilizing the space for outdoor dining\nand/or other permitted activities would be the optimal locations to be\nconsidered for closure.  \n  \nThe Harvard Square Business Association (HSBA) is generally supportive of\nstreet closures that  are limited in terms of times of the day and days of the\nweek, and that help contribute to the vitality and liveliness of Harvard\nSquare, particularly in areas where businesses are seeking additional outdoor\nspace to enhance their operations. The City has successfully partnered with a\nnumber of restaurants in Harvard Square to provide additional space for\noutdoor dining, most prominently on Bow Street between DeWolfe Street and\nPlympton Street. Leaders from HSBA want to ensure that any street closures\nhelp to further activate space within Harvard Square, and do not result in the\narea seeming less busy or less vital. Furthermore, HSBA emphasizes that any\nconsideration of street closures should take into account the needs and\nconstraints of the businesses on those streets.  \n  \nFeedback from local business owners indicates that many small businesses are\nnot supportive of closing the streets in and around Harvard Square beyond the\ncurrent closures for outdoor dining. Construction activity in Harvard Square\nhas resulted in reduced availability of on street parking. During the\npandemic, when patrons are driving to the Square including to \u201cPick It Up\nLocal\u201d as encouraged by the City, businesses have expressed the concern that\nclosing additional streets and further limiting parking could negatively\nimpact their attractiveness, which even more than usual, depend on attracting\nboth local and regional visitors.  \n  \nBased on a letter sent by the Harvard Square Neighborhood Association (HSNA),\nthey are supportive of street closures, as long as those closures are given\n\u201ccareful consideration\u201d and continue to take into account access to key\nlocations that need to be accessible to motor vehicles. Their letter also\nacknowledges the need to accommodate deliveries to local businesses, which is\na critical need.  \n  \nPublic safety experts from the Fire Department  and the Police Department have\nexpressed concerns about the impact on emergency response that would result\nfrom the closure of major streets such as JFK Street, Mount Auburn Street, and\nportions of Brattle Street and/or Church Street (since those two streets\nprovide overlapping access to certain locations within the Square). It is also\nimportant to consider that the closure of more significant streets in Harvard\nSquare would likely result in vehicles detouring to other streets, resulting\nin larger volumes of through vehicular traffic on streets not designed to\ncarry such volumes. Such diversions would also result in multiple additional\nmovements across bikes lanes and unsignalized crosswalks, potentially leading\nto safety issues at those locations. Currently, such detours do take place\nduring special events such as Octoberfest and Mayfair, but these events are\naccompanied by a significant police presence to manage traffic at a level that\nwould not be sustainable for the types of daily or weekly closures proposed in\nthis Policy Order. As with other changes that have been discussed in Harvard\nSquare, it would be important to ensure that closure do not divert commercial\ntraffic onto local residential streets, particularly given the limited\nalternative routes around Harvard Square.  \n  \nA number of the streets in Harvard Square carry Massachusetts Bay\nTransportation Authority (MBTA) bus service, along with other bus services\nfrom the Longwood Medical Area, Harvard University, and other institutions,\nand we would want to ensure that any changes do not negatively impact those\nservices. Although it would be possible to allow buses to travel through\nstreets that are closed to general traffic, this would have to be done very\ncarefully to ensure that all street users are safe and that unauthorized\nvehicles do not follow the buses through the closed area. In addition, keeping\na portion of the street open for buses could compromise the overall intent and\nfunctionality of a street closure.  \n  \nHarvard Square is currently experiencing a significant amount of disruption\ndue to street and building construction. As noted above, limited parking and\nloading zones have been a concern for businesses even prior to COVID-19.\nAdditional closures could also further disrupt deliveries and customer parking\noptions. These construction projects also constrain the locations where we can\nimplement street closures that are beneficial to the local area (e.g., Linden\nStreet is already closed due to Adams House construction). Representatives\nfrom a range of City departments meet monthly with representatives from HSBA,\nHSNA, and small businesses to coordinate Harvard Square construction projects\nand mitigation strategies to reduce their impacts on the district.\n\nNext Steps  \n  \nAt this time when many of our local businesses are struggling with the impacts\nof the COVID-19 pandemic, it is important that we move forward deliberately\nand in consultation with nearby businesses, and ensure that any street\nclosures are both beneficial to Harvard Square and take into account the\npublic health risks associated with COVID-19.  \n  \nThe Harvard Square Advisory Committee is charged with stewardship of Harvard\nSquare and members include representatives of the Harvard Square Business\nAssociation, the Harvard Square Neighborhood Association, Harvard University,\nresidents from adjoining neighborhoods, local businesses and property owners,\namong others. While the principal role of the advisory committee is to review\ndevelopment proposals in the Square, we recommend expanding their scope to\nincorporate consideration and consultation on potential roadway modifications\nas part of a pilot proposal.  \n  \nStaff from the Community Development Department, the Traffic, Parking, and\nTransportation Department, and the Department of Public Works would work with\nthe Harvard Square Advisory Committee and solicit additional public input to\nevaluate a pilot intervention. For initial consideration, we recommend the\nfollowing possibilities:\n\n\u00b7 Maintain the existing full and partial street closures that are currently in\nplace in Harvard Square, specifically Winthrop Street from JFK Street to Eliot\nStreet and the segment of Bow Street from DeWolfe Street to Plympton Street.\nThese closures help support outdoor dining for adjacent restaurants and\nprovide additional pedestrian space for people traveling to and through the\nSquare.\n\n\u00b7 Palmer Street is currently an underutilized public space in Harvard Square.\nAt the same time, it fulfils an important delivery function supporting\nadjacent businesses and office uses while removing those deliveries from\nnearby public streets. Implementation of relatively low-cost tactical visual\nenhancements and activation interventions could improve the quality of the\npublic experience, emphasize the pedestrian-oriented nature of the street, and\ndraw new activity, while still accommodating the delivery function.\n\n\u00b7 Brattle Street, between Eliot Street and Church Street, adjacent to\nDeguglielmo Plaza, is the location most often mentioned for a recurring\nclosure. This space could function as a natural extension of nearby public\nopen spaces, while supporting the business located on this segment of Brattle\nStreet. Church Street functions as a natural alternative route to access the\nremainder of Brattle Street west of Church Street, so the impact on business\naccess could be relatively limited.  \n\nAs noted earlier, we propose working with the Harvard Square Advisory\nCommittee to review and develop an activation strategy for Harvard Square. If\na successful approach can be developed, it could point the way towards\nadditional street modifications in other locations around the Square. In\naddition to the advisory committee, we will continue to meet with the local\ncommunity, including businesses, residents, and institutions to identify\nadditional needs and potential solutions.\n\n",

In response to Awaiting Report 20-51, regarding an update on the installation\nof Rectangular Rapid Flash Beacons (RRFBs) as part of the fourth round of\nParticipatory Budgeting and evaluate the feasibility of installing an RRFB at\nthe intersection of Broadway and Norfolk Street, Budget Director Taha Jennings\nand Traffic, Parking, and Transportation Director Joseph Barr report the\nfollowing:\n\nRound Four of the Participatory Budgeting program (PB4) allocated $176,000 for\nflashing pedestrian beacons in the FY19 Capital Budget, which allows for the\ninstallation of 22 pedestrian beacons. A typical intersection requires two\nbeacons (one on each side of the roadway); for locations with a median (such\nas the northern portion of Massachusetts Avenue), three beacons are required.\n\nThe PB4 proposal included a list of several potential locations for the\nproposed beacons. It is important to note that was simply an illustrative list\nof potential locations, not a definitive list of locations where a decision\nhad been made to install an RRFB, and that the actual Participatory Budgeting\nballot did not include that list. Specific locations where RRFBs are to be\ninstalled are prioritized based on crash history, roadway design/geometry, and\nengineering judgment. In accordance with our evidence-based approach to Vision\nZero, the Traffic, Parking, and Transportation Department worked closely with\nthe Police Department to obtain crash data for unsignalized crosswalks across\nthe city, to allow us to prioritize the locations where the greatest\nimprovement to pedestrian safety could be realized with the allocated funding.\n\nThe safety analysis was conducted with a focus on locations with two approach\nlanes in a single direction. These locations, frequently referred to as\n\u201cmultiple threat\u201d crosswalks, have been documented in local and national\nresearch to create a higher risk of a pedestrian crash, as a driver stopping\nto yield to a pedestrian in the crosswalk may obstruct the visibility of the\npedestrian for a driver approaching in the second lane. Rectangular Rapid\nFlashing Beacons (RRFBs) are a proven countermeasure that have been documented\nto significantly improve driver yielding at multi-lane crosswalks.\n\nTable 1 below documents each of the locations that was selected based on\nanalyzing crash data and assessing pedestrian safety. These locations will\nfully utilize the funding allocated in PB4. City staff are currently engaged\nin a further review of the remaining crosswalks citywide in order to identify\nlocations for additional crosswalks which have been funded for $150,000 under\nPB6, which will allow for the installation of approximately 20 more beacons.\nThrough that process staff will be reviewing locations near schools, parks,\nand senior centers, as well as the locations noted in the Policy Order on\nBroadway and Hampshire Street. Staff will work with the Purchasing Agent over\nthe winter to conduct a bidding process, with construction on the next round\nof beacons commencing in the Spring.\n\nTable 1: Rectangular Rapid Flash Beacons Installed Using PB4 Funds\n\nStreet Name\n\n|\n\nCross Street\n\n|\n\nPB Suggested\n\n|\n\n# of Beacons\n\n|\n\nStatus  \n  \n---|---|---|---|---  \n  \nMassachusetts Avenue\n\n|\n\nMagoun Street\n\n|\n\nNo\n\n|\n\n3\n\n|\n\nIn Progress  \n  \nMassachusetts Avenue\n\n|\n\nGold Star Road\n\n|\n\nNo\n\n|\n\n3\n\n|\n\nComplete  \n  \nMassachusetts Avenue\n\n|\n\nDay Street\n\n|\n\nNo\n\n|\n\n3\n\n|\n\nComplete  \n  \nMassachusetts Avenue\n\n|\n\nAllen Street\n\n|\n\nNo\n\n|\n\n3\n\n|\n\nIn Progress  \n  \nMassachusetts Avenue\n\n|\n\nChurch Street\n\n|\n\nNo\n\n|\n\n2\n\n|\n\nIn Progress  \n  \nMassachusetts Avenue\n\n|\n\nPearl Street\n\n|\n\nYes\n\n|\n\n2\n\n|\n\nComplete  \n  \nMassachusetts Avenue\n\n|\n\nNorfolk Street\n\n|\n\nYes\n\n|\n\n2\n\n|\n\nComplete  \n  \nBrattle Street\n\n|\n\nBrattle Street\n\n|\n\nNo\n\n|\n\n2\n\n|\n\nComplete  \n  \nWestern Avenue\n\n|\n\nHews Street\n\n|\n\nNo\n\n|\n\n2\n\n|\n\nComplete\n\n",

The Planning Board may grant a Quadrangle\nNorthwest Master Plan Special Permit, incorporating any approved special\npermits for the Development Parcel, subject to the following provisions:\n\n(a) Criteria. In addition to the general special permit criteria set forth in\nSection 10.43, the Project Review Special Permit criteria set forth in Section\n19.25, and all other criteria applicable to the special permits being sought,\nthe Planning Board shall find that the following criteria are met when\ngranting a Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Special Permit:\n\n(1) The Master Plan is in substantial conformance with the vision, goals, and\nrecommendations set forth in the Alewife District Plan, including any\namendments to the Alewife District Plan or future City planning reports that\naddress the Alewife District, including but not limited to the topics of land\nuse, open space, urban form, mobility, climate and environment, housing,\neconomy, and zoning, and with any urban design guidelines published by the\nCity pursuant to the Alewife District Plan or any amendments thereto or future\nplanning reports that address the Alewife District;\n\n(2) The Master Plan is in substantial conformance with applicable standards\nfor flood and heat resilience recommended through the City\u2019s Climate Change\nPreparedness and Resilience planning efforts or future climate change planning\nefforts; and\n\n(3) The Master Plan will result in the completion of a publicly accessible\nconnection for bicyclists and pedestrians, at a minimum, across the railroad\nright of way between the Triangle District and the Quadrangle Northwest\nDistrict, with conditions incorporated into the project phasing that will\nensure its completion. A connection that accommodates passenger shuttles is\ndesirable.\n\n(4) Housing - The revised zoning requires that a development proposal must be\nin general conformance with the Alewife District Plan, which would include\nland use. The Alewife District Plan calls for residential use west of the\nextension of Spinelli Place, which is about 40-50% of the anticipated\ndevelopment area. If desired, the Council could add provisions in the\n\u201cCriteria for Approval\u201d section such as a minimum amount or percentage of\nresidential use, and/or requirements for phasing. An approach used in past\nmixed-use developments has been to require the residential phase to commence\nbefore 60% of permitted commercial uses are built, and to complete the\nresidential phase before or concurrently with the completion of commercial\nuses. Within these constraints, a timing and phasing plan for the development\nwould be subject to review and approval by the Planning Board.\n\n(5) Parking - This is also part of the required conformance with the Alewife\nDistrict Plan as included in the revised text. As in other areas of\nredevelopment, the Alewife District Plan anticipates that parking would be\nused flexibly to serve uses throughout the area at different times while\nminimizing the number of parking spaces provided. Minimum parking ratios by\nuse would be eliminated except for a smaller minimum for housing to mitigate\npossible impacts on public street parking, and maximum parking ratios by use\nwould be established as follows:\n\na. Retail: maximum 1.5 per 1,000 SF\n\nb. Office: maximum 1.1 per 1,000 SF\n\nc. R&D: maximum 0.8 per 1,000 SF\n\nd. Industrial: maximum 0.5 per 1,000 SF\n\ne. Residential: maximum 0.75 per dwelling unit, minimum .25 per dwelling unit\n\n(b) Conditions. The Quadrangle Northwest District Master Plan Special Permit\nshall set forth conditions to ensure that the applicable criteria are met,\nincluding but not limited to the following conditions:\n\n(1) Approved land uses and dimensional characteristics of the Master Plan at\nan aggregate level and for individual building sites;\n\n(2) Required public improvements and other benefits such as infrastructure and\nopen space;\n\n(3) Required measures to mitigate development impacts, including but not\nlimited to transportation impacts and construction activity;\n\n(4) Procedures for review and approval of the designs of individual buildings,\nopen spaces, public improvements, and other components of the Master Plan; and\n\n(5) Timing and phasing for completion of the different components of the\nMaster Plan, including but not limited to required public improvements,\nbenefits, and mitigation.\n\n(c) Commencement. The commencement of construction of any single building\napproved in a Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Special Permit shall constitute\nexercise of the special permit for purposes of M.G.L. Chapter 40A and Section\n10.46 of this Zoning Ordinance. The timing of completion shall be set forth by\nthe Planning Board in the conditions of the special permit, which timing may\nbe extended by the Planning Board upon a showing of good cause, and shall be\nsubject to other conditions related to timing and phasing set forth in the\nspecial permit conditions.\n\n(d) Amendments. A Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Special Permit may identify\nspecific modifications to the Master Plan that may be subject to future\napproval by a written determination of the Planning Board. Otherwise, the\nPlanning Board shall determine whether a proposed modification is a Major\nAmendment or Minor Amendment according to the standards set forth in Sections\n12.37.1 through 12.37.3 of this Zoning Ordinance.\n\n20.930.4 Modifications to Standards. Except as otherwise set forth herein, any\nproject receiving a Quadrangle Northwest District Master Plan Special Permit\nshall comply with all other applicable development standards set forth in this\nZoning Ordinance. The following modifications may be authorized by the\nPlanning Board upon granting a Quadrangle Northwest Master Plan Special\nPermit:\n\n(1) The Additional FAR provisions of Paragraph (1) of Section 20.95.11 of this\nZoning Ordinance may be applied to a Quadrangle Northwest Development Parcel\nin its entirety if the proposed development incorporates construction of a\npublicly accessible pedestrian and bicycle bridge connection across the\nrailroad right of way between the Quadrangle Northwest District and the\nTriangle District or incorporation of structural elements into a building's\ndesign that includes or would permit future construction of such a pedestrian\nconnection (that are acceptable to the City for that purpose), as well as the\nconveyance (in a form acceptable to the City) of the necessary fee or easement\nproperty interests in land that would permit access to such a connection, in a\nmanner and to an extent determined to be sufficient to significantly advance\nthe objectives of the Alewife District Plan .\n\n(2) The height of any building, regardless of use, may be increased to a\nmaximum of eighty-five (85) feet, but shall remain subject to the limitations\nof Section 20.95.2, Paragraph 1(a) within 100 feet or 200 feet of a\nresidential or Open Space district, provided the Planning Board finds that the\nentire leasable ground story of any non-residential building (excluding\nentrances/exits, lobbies, circulation, utilities, loading, and other functions\nnecessary to serve upper-story uses or the building as a whole) is planned,\ndesigned, and constructed for the occupancy of light industrial uses and/or\nbusinesses that require light industrial space but also include a consumer-\nfacing or community-focused component as described in the Economy\nRecommendations of the Alewife District Plan, with floor-to-ceiling heights\nthat the Board finds to be suitable for such uses. The Planning Board may\napprove a limited number of Retail and Consumer Service Establishments to\nprovide neighborhood amenities if they do not collectively occupy more than\ntwenty percent (20%) of any building\u2019s total Ground Story and the Board finds\nthat they do not detract from the emphasis on light industrial spaces as\ndescribed in the Alewife District Plan. A residential building, which may\ninclude above-grade structured parking that is located to the rear of and\nvisually screened from the street by principal-use residential space, may also\nbe increased to a maximum of eight-five (85) feet without being required to\nmeet the other requirements of this Paragraph.\n\n(3) If the Planning Board finds that the ground story of any building requires\nelevation above the existing mean grade in order to conform to flood\nresilience standards as established by the City, then the maximum height of\nany building may be further increased by not more than four (4) feet or the\ndifference between the ground story finished floor elevation and the existing\nmean grade, whichever is lesser. To make such finding, the Planning Board\nshall have received and reviewed a written report from the City Engineer\ndescribing flood resilience standards applicable and the impact of those\nstandards to the development site.\n\n(4) Spaces within the ground story of any non-residential building that are\nreserved for light industrial uses or businesses that require light industrial\nspace but also include a consumer-facing or community-focused component as\ndescribed in the Economy Recommendations of the Alewife District Plan may be\nexcluded from the calculation of Gross Floor Area for the purpose of applying\nthe limitations and requirements of this Zoning Ordinance, provided that the\ndimensions of such spaces, their permitted range of approved uses, and other\nconditions to ensure that the intent of the Alewife District Plan is met shall\nbe set forth in writing by the Planning Board in the Quadrangle Northwest\nMaster Plan Special Permit.\n\n(5) Applicable minimum parking requirements shall be waived, and the Planning\nBoard shall set forth maximum limitations and other conditions pertaining to\nthe development and operation of off-street parking facilities in accordance\nwith the Mobility Recommendations of the Alewife District Plan.\n\n(6) Applicable yard requirements and limitations, with the exception of\nrequirements for yards abutting a residential or Open Space district as set\nforth in Paragraph (2) of Section 20.95.31 of this Zoning Ordinance, shall be\nmodified to the extent necessary to conform to the recommended building\nsetbacks and street sections recommended in the Urban Form and Mobility\nRecommendations of the Alewife District Plan, as approved by the Planning\nBoard.\n\n",

In response to Awaiting Report Item Number 20-47, regarding a report on heat\nlamps and outdoor dining during the COVID-19 public health crisis, DPW\nCommissioner Owen O\u2019Riordan, Fire Chief Gerard Mahoney, Chief Public Health\nOfficer Claude Jacob, and Assistant to the City Manager Matthew Nelson report\nthe following:  \n  \nSince early June when the City began accepting Temporary Outdoor Seating\napplications, the City has processed 103 permits for extended outdoor\nseating., These are in addition to the patios that were approved with no\nadditional expansion.  \n  \nIn anticipation of the need to extend outdoor dining into colder months, the\nFire Department expanded its heat lamp Pilot Patio Heater Pilot Project from\nHarvard Square to citywide. To date the Fire Department has permitted thirty-\neight heat lamp permits throughout Cambridge. This is up from just two\nrestaurants having permits for heat lamps when this program was piloted in\nHarvard Square in 2018. The Fire Department has set up a simple online\npermitting portal to make the process as efficient as possible.  \n  \nSince outdoor dining was allowed to operate as part of Phase II of the State\u2019s\nreopening plan in June, Cambridge Restaurants have been following the State\u2019s\nSafety Standards for Restaurants The exception in Cambridge is that\nrestaurants are only permitted to allow six patrons to be seated per table,\nand that as the guidelines state: Tables must be positioned so to maintain at\nleast a 6 foot distance from all other tables and any high foot traffic areas\n(e.g., routes to bathrooms, entrances, exits); tables may be positioned closer\nif separated by protective / non-porous barriers (e.g., structural walls or\nplexiglass dividers) not less than 6 feet high installed between tables and\nhigh foot traffic areas.  \n  \nThe City, working with the Central Square BID and the other business\nassociations, has coordinated with the BID for the BID\u2019s procurement, storage\nand distribution of propane heaters to those businesses who have expressed an\ninterest in purchasing propane heaters, so as to allow them to continue\noutdoor dining through the fall into the winter months. It is expected that\nthese heaters will be available to be picked up from an MIT storage facility\nduring the next week.  \n  \nThe City continues to explore options on ways to make it easier for\nrestaurants to operate in the colder months, including but not limited to:\nproviding notification to restaurants in advance of winter storms, and helping\nto facilitate access to outdoor heaters and propane.\n\n",

The goal of this retreat was to create a space for the School\nCommittee to have honest and in-depth discussions to build rapport.\n\nAs I mentioned in my last communication, my Office has partnered with the Work\nForce Program to bring Elevate Youth to Cambridge\n<https://cambridge.wickedlocal.com/news/20200925/strongcambridge-partners-\nwith-elevate-youth-to-launch-parks-programstrong> for free and safe in-person\noutdoor programming for CPS students in grades 4 and 5 twice a week on Mondays\nand Wednesdays from September 23rd to October 28th at Danehy Park in North\nCambridge and Sennott Park in the Port. Our participating youth will be led by\nolder youth instructors, through the Work Force Program.\n\nWe are continuing to target 4th and 5th grade students who live close to these\nparks (or can secure transportation) and would not typically have the chance\nto experience the outdoors with a structured and supervised program. If you\nknow anyone with children in our target population, please share this\napplication\n<https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd_w0gDQCkuMkYsuimMbcAUwyinSwRBXT20fYHUPOeXIuOaqg/viewform>\nwith them ASAP.\n\nMy Office will be hosting a couple more Family Resource Fairs in partnership\nwith CPS and the School Committee this month. Our upcoming Fairs are on\nSaturday, October 3rd, outside the Putnam Avenue Upper School from 10:00 AM to\n12:00 PM and on Saturday, October 17th, on the Cambridge Public Library lawn\nfrom 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM. Both will be quick grab-and-go events for answering\nback-to-school questions and sharing resources.\n\nThe School Committee\u2019s next Regular Meeting\n<https://www.cpsd.us/UserFiles/Servers/Server_3042785/File/school_committee/notices/2020/10-6-2020_SC_Meeting_Notice.pdf>\nwill be at 6:00 PM on Tuesday, October 6th, 2020. Please see the agenda here\n<https://www.cpsd.us/cms/One.aspx?portalId=3042869&pageId=69707989>. I want to\nhighlight the latest draft of CPSD\u2019s COVID-19 Safety & Facilities Manual\n<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XtUFRjKa9O9qZ9n-JphustSTvr73N41xllfDkEvHy0k/edit>,\nwhich we will be discussing on Tuesday night.\n\nPlease do not hesitate to reach out with any questions, suggestions, or\nconcerns.\n\n![](/Citizens/GetImage.aspx?Type=25&ID=/Aspose.Words.ef2c6cb6-fb6e-4613-a9d2-39d15da0e74f.002.png)\n\nRespectfully,\n\nSumbul Siddiqui\n\n",

Petition Language: To amend Article 14 of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance\n\nMIXED USE DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT: KENDALL CENTER\n\nIntroduction:\n\nWhen Eversource announced its plans for a new electrical substation on\nFulkerson Street, the City Manager asked City and CRA staff, as well as\nrepresentatives from the local development community, to explore an\nalternative site for the facility. After the numerous hearings held by City\nCouncil regarding the substation proposal, Boston Properties (BXP) approached\nthe City and CRA about the idea of placing the substation on the site of the\nexisting \u201cBlue Garage\u201d within the MXD District of the Kendall Square Urban\nRenewal Project Area. Although this alternate site is highly preferred to the\nFulkerson Street location, there are nonetheless many complex technical\nchallenges associated with relocating the substation to this parcel. It\ninvolves not only the design of the substation and high voltage access routes\nto the location, but also completing plans for the housing program currently\noutlined in the Infill Development Concept Plan, fulfilling interim and future\nparking requirements, and designing locations for additional development to\nprovide financial support for this alternative location.\n\nThe CRA hereby submits this zoning petition to amend the Article 14 of the\nCambridge Zoning Ordinance: MXD Development District: Kendall Center in order\nto accommodate the relocation of the Eversource substation to the BXP site.\nCorresponding changes will also be required to the Kendall Square Urban\nRenewal Plan. These changes would affirm the regional utility infrastructure\nland use in the district, as well as provide for additional development rights\nand make adjustments to some dimensional restrictions to facilitate the\nalternative site.\n\n1. Replace the current Subsection 14.21.7(6) with the following text:\n\n14.21.7(6) Transformer station, substation, gas regulator station, or pumping\nstation and related utility uses.\n\n2. Replace first three paragraphs of current Subsection 14.32.1 with the text below: \n\n14.32.1 The Aggregate gross floor area (GFA) of development in the District\nshall not exceed the sum of (i) four million, four hundred seventy three\nthousand (4,473,000) square feet, plus (ii) six hundred thousand (600,000)\nsquare feet that shall be limited to multi-family residential uses as\npermitted in Section 14.21.4(1), for a total Aggregate GFA not to exceed five\nmillion, seventy three thousand (5,073,000) square feet. Up to sixty thousand\n(60,000) square feet of such Aggregate GFA of four million, four hundred\nseventy-three thousand (4,473,000) in clause (i) of the preceding sentence,\nshall be allowable only by special permit pursuant to Section 14.72.\n\nAt least two hundred thousand (200,000) square feet of the GFA restricted to\nhousing uses shall occur only within the area designated on the Zoning Map as\nthe \u201cAmes Street District\u201d and has been approved by special permit dated March\n27,2015 (the \u201cAmes Street Residential Project\u201d).\n\nAdditionally, a building permit for construction of a residential project of\nat least four hundred thousand (400,000) square feet shall be issued prior to\nor concurrently with the issuance of a building permit for any project\nutilizing Utility Project GFA (as defined in Section 14.32.2 below). The\ndesign review process for a residential project of at least four hundred\nthousand (400,000) square feet shall also precede, or proceed concurrently\nwith, the design review process for any project utilizing Utility Project GFA,\nin accordance with a special permit approving a Concept Plan as set forth in\nSection 14.32.2 below.\n\n3\\. Add the following paragraph to the end of Subsection 14.32.2:\n\nAny additional Infill GFA for commercial uses that is not the subject of the\nexisting Concept Plan approved by Special Permit PB #315 on March 20, 2017 (as\namended by Amendment #1 (Major) dated January 31, 2019) (collectively, the\n\u201cExisting Concept Plan\u201d) may only be utilized in conjunction with the\ndevelopment by NSTAR Electric Company d/b/a Eversource (or its successors and\nassigns) of a substation within the District (\u201cthe Substation Project\u201d) and\nonly on property within the District owned by the entity (or an affiliate\nthereof) that provided the land on which the Substation Project is to be\ndeveloped. For the purposes of this Article, the eight hundred thousand\n(800,000) square feet of Infill GFA for commercial uses that is not the\nsubject of the Existing Concept Plan may sometimes be referred to as \u201cUtility\nProject GFA\u201d. The issuance of a building permit for the Substation Project\nshall precede or be issued concurrently with the issuance of a building permit\nfor any project utilizing Utility Project GFA.\n\nThe MXD District is expected to achieve high standards for urban design,\narchitectural design, environmental sustainability and open space design, and\nto transform the area into a recognizable center of activity and civic life\nfor Kendall Square and the surrounding neighborhoods. The District should\ncreate open space to serve residents in the area, as well as workers, students\nfrom nearby institutions, and visitors. It should promote permeability at the\nedges of the District, and create public spaces that will feel welcoming and\ncomfortable for all users.\n\n4.

Additionally the plan will\ninclude a narrative describing the plan\u2019s compatibility, coordination and\nconsistency with the urban design guidelines set forth in the Kendall Square\nFinal Report of the K2C2 Planning Study (\u201cK2 Guidelines\u201d) the Volpe Working\nGroup\u2019s Planning & Design Principles dated July 20, 2017 (the \u201cVolpe\nGuidelines\u201d) and the planning principles referenced in Section 14.32.2.\n\n5. Replace current Subsection 14.32.2.2 with the following text:\n\n14.32.2.2 Findings and Approval. The Planning Board shall grant a special\npermit approving a Concept Plan upon finding that the new development\nidentified within the plan meets the criteria for approval of a Planned Unit\nDevelopment set forth in Section 12.35.3(3) of the Zoning Ordinance and the\ncriteria for approval of a Project Review Special Permit set forth in Section\n19.25 of the Zoning Ordinance. In making its findings, the Board shall\nconsider the objectives set forth in the K2 Guidelines and the Volpe\nGuidelines. The approval of a Concept Plan shall serve to meet any applicable\nproject review requirements of Article 19.000, and no additional Project\nReview Special Permit shall be required for new development that is identified\nwithin an approved Concept Plan. In addition, while the location of the\nSubstation Project is to be shown on a Concept Plan, the actual development of\nthe Substation Project shall not be included within the scope of a special\npermit approving a Concept Plan (but shall remain subject to all applicable\nregulations governing the construction of such projects).\n\n6. Add the following new Subsection 14.32.5(d) at the end of Subsection 14.32.5:\n\nd) Inapplicability to Utility Project GFA. Notwithstanding the foregoing\nprovisions of this Section 14.32.5. there shall be no Innovation Space\nrequirement for any project utilizing Utility Project GFA (nor shall any such\nproject utilizing Utility Project GFA be entitled to utilize Innovation Space\nin order to obtain a GFA Exemption under Section 14.32.6(3) below).\n\n7\\.  Replace current Subsection 14.32.6(2) and 14.32.6(3) with the following\ntext:\n\n2) Outdoor Area Exemptions: Private outdoor decks or balconies for multi-\nfamily residential or commercial development, up to eight percent (8%) of the\nbuilding floor area.\n\n3) Innovation Space: Innovation Space GFA up to the lesser of either twenty\npercent (20%) of the Infill GFA dedicated to Office and Biotechnology\nManufacturing Uses or one hundred five thousand (105,000) square feet. In\norder for the Innovation Space GFA to be exempt from the Aggregate GFA\nlimitations, at least twenty five percent (25%) of the Innovation Space\nutilization (measured by square footage or shared space membership) must be\nset aside as below market rate space to be offered by the CRA or the City to\nqualifying tenants for short-term leases consistent with Section 14.32.5(b).\n\n8. Add the following new Subsections 14.32.6(7) and 14.32.6(8) at the end of Subsection 14.32.6:\n\n7)  Electrical Substation: The Substation Project shall be exempt from\nAggregate GFA calculation as well as the requirements as to Floor Area Ratio.\nFurther, substation construction shall not constitute Infill GFA (or Utility\nProject GFA).\n\n8) Educational Lab, Classroom or Training Facility: Up to twenty thousand\n(20,000) square feet of educational, health or workforce training facilities\noperated to provide services to the general public (as opposed to private\nfacilities that are solely accessible by tenants or occupants of commercial\nbuildings within the District), which such services are either permitted as of\nright within the District in accordance with the provisions of this Article 14\nor may otherwise be permitted by special permit.\n\n9.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, one building within the District\nmay reach four hundred (400) feet provided, however, that the occupied floors\nabove two hundred and fifty feet (250) feet may only contain residential and\nassociated amenity space. Additionally, the floorplate of any portion of a\nbuilding above two hundred fifty (250) feet shall not exceed twelve thousand\nfive hundred (12,500) square feet.\n\n11. Replace current Section 14.38 with the following text:\n\n14.38 Active Ground Floors. The ground floor of newly constructed buildings\nutilizing fifty thousand (50,000) square feet or more of Infill GFA, where\nthat ground floor fronts onto Main Street, Broadway or Ames Street, must be\noccupied by (i) Retail and Consumer Service uses, as listed in Section\n14.21.3, or (ii) active public gathering space (whether enclosed or open),\nalong a minimum length of seventy-five percent (75%) of the building fa\u00e7ade\nalong this frontage; provided, however, that the requirement shall be forty\npercent (40%) for any building with a fa\u00e7ade length of one hundred (100) feet\nor less along such frontage onto Main Street, Broadway or Ames Street.\nDimensional variations and alternate uses may be approved by the Planning\nBoard upon determining that the specific uses and designs proposed are\nconsistent with the purpose and intent of this Section 14.38. Alternatively,\nif a Concept Plan provides for the redevelopment of existing buildings to\ninclude new Retail and Consumer Service uses along the ground floor of any of\nthe identified street frontages, then the Planning Board may permit a\nreduction in the required length of active street frontage for new buildings\nfor up to fifty percent (50%) of the length of new active street frontage\nprovided in existing buildings and only if the Board finds that it results in\na better outcome for the District as a whole. Banks and financial institutions\nshall not be considered active ground floor uses for the purposes of meeting\nthis requirement.\n\n12. Replace current Section 14.39 with the following text:\n\n14.39 Letter of Commitment.\n\nIt is acknowledged and agreed that the Letter of Commitment dated December 21,\n2015 by Boston Properties Limited Partnership is hereby replaced by the Letter\nof Commitment dated January 28, 2021 by the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority.\nAs such, the Letter of Commitment dated December 21, 2015 by Boston Properties\nis declared null and void and of no further force or effect, and shall no\nlonger be binding upon Boston Properties Limited Partnership or its successors\nand assigns.\n\n13.

All proposed development shall be restricted from\nconstructing parking spaces, either on or off the lot within the District,\nbeyond the maximum allowances of Table 1. If a development includes more than\none category of use, then the number of spaces allowed for the development\nshall be the sum of the allowance for each category of use. Where the\ncomputation of required spaces results in a fractional number, only a fraction\nof one half or more shall be counted as one. The Planning Board may approve\narrangements for shared parking of such residential parking spaces with\ncommercial spaces or otherwise adjust the minimum parking requirements based\non review and analysis of anticipated parking demand within the Transportation\nImpact Study.\n\n14. Replace current Subsection 14.52.3 with the following text:\n\n14.52.3 The parking allowances specified in Table 1 may be satisfied by a\nlease agreement between the developer and the City, other public entity, or\nprivate consortium for use of parking spaces in a public or pooled private\nparking facility located within the District (or, in the case of the spaces\nrequired for residential uses, located outside of the District but within one\nthousand (1,000) feet of the residential building for which the parking is\nbeing provided, measured from property edge to property edge), provided that\non a temporary basis, spaces required for residential uses may be within two\nthousand (2,000) feet of the residential building while permanent residential\nparking is being constructed. The total number of parking spaces leased and\nconstructed within the district for development on a lot shall not exceed the\nmaximum allowances provided for in Table 2.\n\n15. Replace current Subsection 14.52.6 with the following text:\n\n14.52.6 Bicycle Parking: Bike parking shall be provided as set forth in\nSection 6.100 of this Zoning Ordinance; provided that in issuing a special\npermit approving a Concept Plan, the Planning Board may determine that the\nbicycle parking requirements for individual buildings shown on the Concept\nPlan may be met utilizing a campus planning approach toward bicycle parking.\n\n14.52.6.1 Intent: To allow flexibility within the high-density environment of\nthe MXD District while providing high quality, equitable, and thoughtfully\nplanned bicycle parking and sustainable transportation amenities for all\nusers, consistent with Section 6.108.2. Given the complexity of infrastructure\nrequirements of the Substation Project, the bicycle parking provisions set\nforth in Section 6.100 is infeasible, and a comprehensive bicycle parking plan\nwill be needed to help to balance space constraints and competing uses on or\nnear the ground level.\n\n14.52.6.2 Bike Parking Plan: The bicycle parking plan may utilize a\ncombination of the following strategies, or other design provisions that meet\nthe principles of Section 6.108.3:\n\na) Public Bicycle Sharing Facilities: Where a new, standard-size Public\nBicycle Sharing Station or larger is provided (i) on the lot, or (ii) on a\nsite within five hundred (500) feet of the lot, with written approval of the\nCity if located on a public street or other City Property, or otherwise by\nlegally enforceable mutual agreement with the owner of the land on which the\nstation is to be located. If Public Bicycle Sharing Station(s) are provided,\neach bicycle dock within that station may count for up to two (2) required\nbicycle parking spaces.\n\nShould it be deemed beneficial to the operation of a Public Bicycle Sharing\nsystem by the Community Development Department and the Public Bicycle Sharing\nsystem operator, a developer may meet additional bicycle parking requirements\nby providing a secure, accessible and geographically central location for the\nstorage and/or maintenance of the publicly shared bicycles. If a Public\nBicycle Sharing storage and/or maintenance facility is provided, each\ndesignated bicycle storage space shall count for up to one-half (0.5) of a\nrequired bicycle parking space\n\nb) Countercyclical Bicycle Parking Facility: As the District will contain\nresidential and commercial uses having different peak parking demand times,\nmultiple buildings may share parking facilities within three hundred (300)\nfeet from each other. A shared bicycle parking space may count as a required\nbicycle parking space for both a residential use and a commercial use within\nseparate buildings within a campus plan.\n\nc) Complementary Valet Bicycle Parking: Bicycle parking may be provided\nthrough a valet bicycle parking program that is offered free of charge to\nusers. In order to utilize valet bicycle parking, a developer must submit for\nthe Planning Board\u2019s approval a plan describing:\n\ni. The design of the valet bicycle parking facilities (which shall not be\nrequired to conform with the dimensional regulations of Section 6.100).\n\nii. The proposed number of attendants, number of bicycle parking spaces\nprovided, hours of valet service operations, and other pertinent information.\n\nWhen an approved valet bicycle parking program that was utilized to meet the\nrequirements of Section 6.100 is discontinued, the property owner must either\nbring the bicycle parking spaces into full conformance with the bicycle\nparking requirements of Section 6.100 or seek approval from the Planning Board\nfor an alternative approach.\n\nThe combination of the strategies above, or other provisions accepted by the\nPlanning Board, shall allow a project to adjust the minimum required number of\nbicycle parking spaces, as supported through analysis made available to the\nPlanning Board.\n\n",

      "full_text": " A communication was received from Councillor Nolan, transmitting a memorandum on Filing for Reconsideration. Councillor Nolan Memorandum on why I filed for Reconsideration of the contract\nvote\n\nArguably the most important vote the city council takes is on hiring a city\nmanager. In my view, the vote taken earlier this week on the city manager (CM)\ncontract was flawed, unclear, and warrants discussion with full transparency,\nwhich could not happen given the circumstances of a vote taken at 1 am based\non a document distributed at that time. I requested an executive session to\ndiscuss the contract terms, and was told that could not happen without\nreconsideration. The only path to having a discussion of the terms was\nreconsideration. I believe and state unequivocally that it is the council, not\nthe CM, who failed in this situation.\n\nAmong the first meetings I attended as a city councillor were Government\nOperations Committee meetings where the question of a city manager contract\nwas the agenda. On February 19, the topic was discussed and a letter from the\nCM stating that he was interested in a successor contract was accepted. It was\nexplicitly stated that accepting the letter from the CM simply put on record\nthat the committee had received it. At that meeting, the question of a review\nof the CM was mentioned, since the contract calls for one, led by the\nGovernment Operations Committee. I and several councillors advocated for a\ngoal-setting and review process. It was recognized as good practice, good\ngovernance, and good modeling.\n\nOn March 12, the same committee met again to discuss the city manager\ncontract. During that meeting (full minutes here) there was discussion of what\nthe process would be to move forward and how to proceed. There was a\nsuggestion that the committee state it was interested in a one-year extension\n(that motion failed). There was discussion on what would happen over the next\nfew months, how to start a search for a new CM, and other items. During that\nmeeting the process outlined for the committee members, other councillors such\nas myself and the public was that the chair of the committee would be\nauthorized \u201cto have a discussion with Mr. DePasquale regarding that request\u201d\nof a new contract. After such discussion, there would be an executive session\nfor the full council to discuss what a contract might include. An \u201cexecutive\nsession\u201d was mentioned eight times during the meeting. That is standard\npractice and in line with my experience on the School Committee and on other\nboards - after getting a sense of what is wanted in a contract, the full body\nmeets in executive session to be apprised of any information relevant to\nopening negotiations, and review strategy and/or discuss possible terms that\nwould be offered. The minutes of the March 12 meeting are very clear that the\nchair was authorized to open discussions only, and not to negotiate. The\nminutes of that meeting were on the July 27 council meeting, and presumably\nthat meant that as of that date the chair was authorized to ask the CM what he\nwanted.\n\nBased on my own experience, my understanding of proper procedure and the\nexplicit commitment at that meeting, I expected that before any contract would\nbe offered the full council would weigh in, during an executive session.\nInstead, on our September 14 meeting agenda was a policy order from Councillor\nSimmons asking the council to extend the CM contract for 18 months \u201cwith a 2.5\npercent cost of living adjustment at signing.\u201d There are several questions\nthat arise from that recommendation. The chair was never authorized to engage\nin negotiations with the CM, only to discuss what he wanted, so why were we\nasked to vote on terms? And during discussion of this policy order, it became\nclear that the description of the compensation was wrong. A COLA is given to\nnon-union staff in July of each year, and the CM received a 2.5% COLA\nadjustment on July 1, 2020. During our discussion, the council was told there\nwere \u201cno changes\u201d, that the contract was an extension of the current contract,\nwith \u201cwhat he gets anyway...following what he has in previous contracts as a\ncost of living\u201d. Yet the draft contract which was printed and given to council\nmembers after midnight WAS different. It included not just a COLA, but a\nseparate 2.5% raise upon signing.\n\nAny potential contract should have been reviewed, discussed and jointly voted\nin executive session, as had been promised earlier in the year. I, as a new\ncouncillor, experienced with several contract negotiations with\nsuperintendents, was surprised and taken aback. How did a process which could\nand should have been professional and sensitive, become a public mess? Many of\nus expressed confusion about what the terms were, and whether they were\nappropriate. Many of us were exhausted, and while we wanted to respect the CM\nalso wanted to recognize that the process through no fault of the CM, was\ndisconcerting at best. The draft had some handwritten notes, some things\nscratched out, and an end date that matched with no specific logic. And it\nwasn\u2019t clear to me if we were voting on an actual contract or the rough\noutlines of one that could be finalized later.\n\nI did wonder over the course of August when we would go into an executive\nsession - and I did reach out to several colleagues about when we would next\nhear about the contract. I never heard back and several colleagues also did\nnot know. In retrospect, I should have asked why we hadn\u2019t had an executive\nsession. We hadn\u2019t had a regular meeting since the July 27 meeting when the\ncommittee report authorizing the beginning of contract discussion was\naccepted. I know the CM was anxious to get this done, and he was told the\nprocess was fine. In my opinion, the council mishandled this process, not the\nCM.\n\nWhy bother reconsidering since I am and was prepared to vote a contract for 18\nmonths? I woke up the next day troubled. Troubled by a deeply flawed process\nthat was undemocratic, unclear and counter to the good governance I promised\nto model and practice every day when I took the oath of office. And floored by\nthe fact that several of us were not entirely sure what compensation package\nwe were approving. The meeting video shows the confusion. From an assertion\nthat nothing was different about this contract, that it was just an extension\non the same terms with nothing new to an assertion that it included a double\nraise to a question on why the end date did not\u2019 match with anything, it was\nan embarrassing display that was not something the council should condone or\ntolerate or let stand. Especially in one of the most significant votes we\ntake, we should be very clear that we know what the vote means.\n\nAnd, I am uncomfortable that it was not clear at that moment that the vote\nentailed a raise separate from a COLA. The public should have confidence that\nwe are looking out for their interests and carefully monitoring spending of\nevery dollar. We are in the middle of a pandemic and the financial situation\nof the city almost certainly will deteriorate over the next year or two. We\nmay be asking our workers, our unions and our residents to tighten their\nbelts, to lower expectations for what the city can offer. We should be\nconscious of every dollar. And yet, in these challenging times when everyone\nhas been working overtime, many have lost their homes, their livelihoods and\ntheir savings, I cannot in good conscience approve a raise even of 2.5% on a\nsalary that in my view is already far more than it should be. I reviewed the\nsalaries of mayors and city managers of several cities across the country\nwhich are our size or in some cases a few times bigger and more complex, all\nof which have AAA bond ratings. None are paid as much any close to the current\n$323K (scheduled to go up to $339K next July 1) as Cambridge\u2019s City Manager.\nMost are paid much less. Both Mayor Walsh of Boston (AAA bond rated city) and\nGovernor Baker make far less. I respect the CM and sincerely hope he will stay\nfor the next 18 months. I wish we\u2019d only been asked to vote on a standard\ncontract per the policy order as written, without an additional raise. Or that\nwe\u2019d had an executive session. Then this reconsideration would not have been\nfiled.\n\nAnother note: Through my years of service on School Committee, I took the\nresponsibility for overseeing the superintendent seriously. Many years back,\nwhen the School Committee failed to fulfill its obligation to conduct a review\nand got appropriate criticism, I vowed never to let that happen on my watch. I\ntook over the role of ensuring the review of the superintendent happened. It\nwas always a fruitful and helpful process - an opportunity to reflect on the\npast year, recognize and celebrate what went well and discuss how best to\napproach the coming year. That process is an essential part of any high\nfunctioning organization. I hope that will happen in the future with any city\nmanager.\n\n",

Listed below are the recommendations of the Community Preservation Act\nCommittee (CPAC) for FY2021. For additional information, please see\nattachments from the CPA Committee Chair, Lisa Peterson, dated September 10,\n2020.  \n  \nThe CPA process included a virtual public hearing held on July 1, 2020 to\nsolicit proposals and ideas on CPA projects for FY2021. A second virtual\npublic hearing was held on August 5, 2020 to solicit recommendations on the\npercentage of CPA funds allocated to each funding category: Affordable\nHousing, Historic Preservation, and Open Space. The CPAC also received several\nonline submissions, e-mails and mailed comments regarding potential CPA\nprojects and the allocation percentages. The CPAC, on September 9, 2020, voted\n7-1 for an allocation of 80% for Affordable Housing, 10% for Historic\nPreservation projects and 10% for Open Space projects.  \n  \nIn accordance with the CPAC\u2019s recommendations, I am requesting that the City\nCouncil appropriate a total of $15,330,000 in CPA funds raised by the City's\nFY2021 CPA surcharge, the FY2020 state match funds received in FY2021 and a\nportion of the existing CPA Fund Balance.  \n  \nFor this appropriation, it is estimated that the net local receipts from the\nCPA surcharge for FY2021 will total $10,500,000, added to an anticipated\nFY2020 state match of $2,150,000 and an additional $2,670,000 from CPA Fund\nBalance. Additionally, $10,000 from CPA Fund Balance will go to the City\u2019s\nannual membership in the Community Preservation Coalition.  \n  \nOn September 9, 2020 the CPAC made recommendations for allocation of these\nFY2021 funds.
