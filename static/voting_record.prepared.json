Denise SimmonsCouncillor Quinton Zondervan| In City Council July 29, 2019  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Ordinance Committee, comprised of the entire membership of the City Council, held a public hearing on June 26, 2019 at 3:35 PM in the Sullivan Chamber. \n\nThe purpose of the hearing was to discuss a petition received from Self Storage Group, LLC to amend the Zoning Ordinance by creating a New Street Overlay District (ATTACHMENT A).\n\nPresent at the hearing were Councillor Carlone and Councillor Kelley, Co-Chairs of the Committee, Vice Mayor Devereux, Councillor Mallon, Councillor Siddiqui, Councillor Toomey, Councillor Zondervan, Director of Zoning and Development Jeff Roberts\n\nand Donna P. Lopez, City Clerk\u2019s Office.\n\nAlso present were Attorney James Rafferty, 907 Massachusetts Avenue, co-petitioners of Self Storage Group, LLC (SSG) David M. Williams, Director of Development, SSG Development and Construction, 129 South Street, Fourth Floor, Boston and\n\nGeorge A. Bachrach, Principal, David Fulton, Mark Boyes-Watson, architect for the project and Craig Nicholson, Just-A-Start (JAS).\n\nCouncillor Carlone convened the hearing and stated the purpose. He announced that the hearing was being audio and video recorded. He outlined the format of the hearing: petitioners, staff, clarifying question session, public comment and the Ordinance Committee will discuss the petition and come to a conclusion and make a recommendation.\n\nAttorney James Rafferty spoke on behalf of the co-petitioners SSG, the owner of one of the parcels, and present from SSG is David Williams, George Bachrach and David Fulton. The architect for project, Mark Boyes Watson, is present. He stated that this is a petition that is being jointly filed by the owners of two parcels that are contained in the proposed New Street Overlay District. This is a refiled petition and the original petition did not advance beyond the Ordinance committee. He stated that with lessons learned from the original petition and feedback received, the property owner went back and analyzed the entire program. He noted that the overriding message that was heard from the last presentation was the need to create more of an active and mixed-use environment on New Street. He explained that the prior proposal allowed for an increase in density and height for this newly created use. The petition creates a new category of storage. He stated that the current storage is treated with no distinction in the table of uses between a warehouse that would accommodate all types of truck traffic and uses typically associated with storage warehouses, versus self-storage which is a consumer-oriented establishment. He stated that the representatives from SSG can tell more about self-storage which has a number of benefits and attributes that are stabilizing forces in residential communities. He stated that this is the goal sought by the proponents that believe that this location will benefit greatly from the type of business that they provide. \n\nFrom a zoning perspective Rafferty said there are three changes to the petition that are noteworthy. He stated that the first change is the criteria that would be imposed on any application for a special permit to allow for additional height and would not include a requirement affordable housing. He noted that there was no housing proposed in the prior petition. He continued that the petition in its current form in Section 20.95.1 (1) The first criteria talks about a minimum of 8,000 square feet of affordable housing. The proponents have modified and will show a plan to include 20,000 square feet of affordable housing and petitioners are pleased to report that they have entered a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Just-A-Start (JAS). Attorney Rafferty announced that Mr. Nicholson from JAS is here to discuss this joint venture agreement that they intend to pursue where JAS experience, expertise and knowledge in affordable housing will be put to good use here. He stated that JAS will own and control this affordable housing. He added that the design of the housing has become a critical aspect of mitigating the impact of the building. The architect will demonstrate how the housing use at this site can be compatible and can serve as a softening of the building edge as it approaches the street. \n\nHe stated that the other notable amendment that would be sought by the applicant would involve the height dimension. This is in Section 20.96 and the language of the petition states that the maximum height for the petition could be 65 feet. They are proposing an amendment that there would be a bulk plane requirement, a requirement that exists in many zonings and overlay districts in the City. He explained that at the 55-foot height the building on all four sides will have to step back at a 45-degree angle from 55 to 65 feet. He stated that this has the effect of reducing the mass of the building both as the building is seen on New Street and from Danehy Park. He noted that these are the two substantive changes. \n\nRafferty stated that the third component of petition that there is an area of 2,500 square feet devoted to retail use. He noted that the intention is for the Evolve Gym to have a facility. He stated that Mr. Bachrach can go through the details of the arrangements. The Evolve Gym is now a tenant at will and their lease expired at the end of December 2018 and the owner of the building is fully intent on selling the building. He noted that it has been a case that the Evolve Gym\u2019s long-term use at the site is very limited. He explained that an arrangement has been made that the proponents will build out a space for Evolve at a size that will work for the gym, although it is a different size. He stated that the size was the subject of negotiations with Evolve and the rental rate for the space will be a below market rate in an effort to keep this component an active use in the building. The hope is that Evolve will remain for a long time. The scaling back of the proposed height and the introduction of the gym are two of the changes. \n\nRafferty stated that the Planning Board\u2019s presentation did not include the bulk plane restrictions nor the increase in the amount of affordable housing. He noted that there are components of the petition that are very different than what the Planning Board evaluated. \n\nHe stated that Mr. Boyes-Watson will present some visual elements of this presentation that would turn the text of the petition into an understanding of what can be built at the site. He commented that it has been an effective collaboration with Mr. Boyes-Watson and JAS on how to optimize housing at this location, creating the type of unit size that would be most affected. He spoke about the obvious adjacency to a large recreational facility, walking distance to an elementary school makes this a very attractive housing location for families and the fact that there are residential uses emerging on the other side of New Street. He addressed the comment about why the overlay district only encompasses one side of the street. He responded that this is a function of reality. The other side of the street has an existing residential building already underway and it did not make sense to include those parcels in the overlay district because it was unlikely to see much change in those buildings. He stated that the other element of the petition that is new to the petition addresses a consistent theme with the Envision Planning in the Alewife Area. He stated that the idea to find locations in emerging mixed-use districts within Alewife where additional housing could be permitted. He stated that the petition does contain language that Mr. Markarian (owner of adjacent site) or his successor to be motivated to convert the automotive and the light industrial uses to housing. This is to incentivize housing on this side of New Street. He stated that regarding the site presentation there is an opportunity to make the connection on land owned by the petitioner to the back end of Danehy Park. At this time Mr. Boyes-Watson gave his presentation.\n\nMark Boyes-Watson, architect, spoke about the overarching urban design of the overlay by viewing slides, including existing conditions and some of the proposed streetscape design, to see if New Street can with the change in zoning become what it seems to want to become, which is more of a housing street and less a street of a strange mixture of uses that it is today. He stated that with the changes New Street can become a mixture of housing. He gave a presentation (ATTACHMENT B) of the overall building that incorporates housing along New Street, which is accessible on the ground floor. One of the slides begins to show the relationship is of the housing to the storage building. He stated that there is a planted setback on the New Street level before Danehy Park rises. The building is raised out of the ground because it is in a flood zone. He spoke about the bulk plane setting the top story back and it is more than a 45-degree bulk control plane on New Street. He stated that the top floor of the storage building starts 40 feet back and the public will not be aware of the upper top story when on New Street. \n\nHe stated that the parking is concealed inside the building. This parking is also for the housing and gym. He noted that the storage space is a low traffic generation and does not require parking; it is used intermittently and there is a modest loading zone. The gym has windows that look out onto Danehy Park. \n\nThere is a proposed bike and pedestrian pathway. Watson spoke about a storage facility for sports equipment because there is a shortage of storage at Danehy Park. This is accessed off the pedestrian pathway. He stated that the housing is used as the primary street frontage for New Street. He stated that the storage facility has a green wall design and a gallery of windows overlooking Danehy Park and the upper setback story of the storage facility is setback 45 feet. He stated that additional plant material will be introduced on the site. He stated that there are existing trees along the border and on the park edge. He stated that a robust row of trees will be planted down the property line. He explained that the intention of this building is to get to Net Zero and the storage area is energy efficient. He stated that combining the large roof and the well-designed envelope it is expected that this building can be both the equivalent of LEED Gold and Net Zero. \n\nThe proposed building is creating a more consistent urban form down this side of New Street as is the HRI building (now under construction) that overlooks Fresh Pond. He stated that the creation of these units of affordable housing is an appropriate urban design response to this location. He spoke about the traffic at the site. He stated that the self-storage use is one of the lowest traffic generators. He stated that the 2070 compliance is for the flood and storm water requirements and currently the site tends to flood but a storage infiltration system can be designed that sits under the parking level to deal with this. The site can be designed to mitigate environmental conditions and this is a great advantage. \n\nCraig Nicholson, JAS, stated that JAS was approached by SSG to work with them on the affordable housing component for this site. JAS entered into a MOU and upon this project going forward JAS would be in a position to take over the housing component, own it, keep it permanently affordable, manage it and maintain it in the same fashion as JAS does for the rest of its portfolio. He commented that the inclusion of affordable housing in the project is a creative way to take something that could just become a commercial component and have some inclusionary money sent into the trust fund. Hopefully it would get used in the right place and right time, but put it into a situation where housing definitely gets built and by having it be a mixed used building where the entire front of the building is housing there is no possibility that there will be only a storage structure without housing up front. This is unique and a way to ideally and ultimately create affordable housing at less cost than if it were an open market transaction. He added that JAS is excited to partner with SSG on this. \n\nHe stated that a 20,000 square foot building would yield approximately 20 units, but in this scenario, we are looking for less than 20 units because the goal is predominantly family size units. He outlined the units as 20% of the units would be 3-bedroom units and 60% of the units would be 2-bedroom units and on the affordability level would be looking for more of a moderate affordability at 80%. He spoke about the typical family size that occupies a 1, 2- or 3-bedroom units, which would bring families into this neighborhood next to Danehy Park with the moderate affordability at the 80% AMI. This is very difficult to achieve in Cambridge. He stated that a lot of the programs for new construction for affordable housing requires tax credits, which puts this tier significantly lower and creates a gap in the middle. He noted that this unique situation where housing can be created without the same overly heavily subsidized tax credit type of approach creates a moderate tier for ideally working families within Cambridge is something that JAS is excited to be a part of. \n\nMr. Bachrach stated that he is proud of the work being done with JAS and the efforts to accommodate the gym. He stated that much was learned at the Planning Board hearing which did not go well and as a result significant changes were made to the design to reduce the height, allow setbacks so that you are looking at four-story building from the front of the building. He stated that the self-storage business is nothing more than a neighborhood closet. He stated that 75% of customers are residential and 25% of customers are small businesses and all from the immediate neighborhood. He stated that this industry helps to stabilize neighborhoods. He spoke about small businesses that run out of storage space and cannot afford to rent larger space at $30 a square foot in Cambridge so they come to the storage space at $2 a square foot to off-load their back-office inventory or record keeping and are able to stay in the neighborhood. He cited other examples where storage space is needed. He stated that this is a local amenity with low traffic and uses less water than a single-family home. \n\nHe stated that in terms of the public benefits if approved the project would provide storage space for families in transition who are at risk of losing their possessions, storage space for athletic equipment used at Danehy Park and the pedestrian and bike path along the Danehy Park side of the building. He stated that he is proud of the proposed rooftop solar field, which will the largest private solar field in the City. He stated that he hopes to do more as time goes by with more community input into this process which is only at the early stage. He expects to get more input if given the opportunity to proceed. \n\nCouncillor Carlone asked if there are any clarifying questions.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan stated that storage does not require parking, just the loading. He asked if all the parking is for the housing and the gym. Mr. Williams stated that the storage does need a little parking. He added that most of the activity happens in the loading area. He stated that when a customer comes to a storage facility they park, go into the office and arrange for a contract and when they go to use the storage facility by either taking possessions in or out of the storage unit they park in the loading area and go in and out; there is a low parking need for this type of building. Councillor Zondervan asked could there be less parking. Mr. Williams said this parking will support the housing, the gym and the storage. He stated that there is an allowance of 5-7 spaces for the gym and 7-8 spaces for the 15 units of housing for a total of 20 parking spaces in the parking field. \n\nAttorney Rafferty said the petition proposes that the parking requirement for dwelling units be reduced from the current l in the district to .75 so the residential parking is being scaled back. He explained that Mr. Nicholson has stated throughout his portfolio there are many households without cars. Councillor Zondervan commented that he is in favor of reducing this to zero. He asked if this can be constructed in such a way that the parking can be reclaimed in the future if it is determined that the parking is not needed. Mr. Williams responded in the affirmative. \n\nCouncillor Zondervan asked if there is another floor above and referenced slide 7. Mr. Williams stated that this is showing a typical upper floor. This floor plan would be for floors 2, 3 and 4 of the housing and storage. The fifth-floor storage would be a smaller footprint because it is set back.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan stated that on slide 9 he questioned LEED Gold and Net Zero and stated that this felt tentative. Mr. Boyes-Watson spoke of the design being changed and the roof shrinking. He noted that the housing does use more energy than the storage facility. He stated that he was trying not to over promise. Mr. Williams stated that on the original design from last year calculations were done and they were able to get the storage building at the Net Zero classification. He noted that the design has evolved with input and the roof for the self-storage has shrunk with the inclusion of the housing. He stated that all the calculations have not been finished with the modified design. He stated that he felt confident that they can get a large solar field on the fourth floor of the roof and parts of the fifth floor of the roof and the housing has not been analyzed to see how a component could work with this. He stated that this goal is important to the petitioners. Mr. Nicholson stated that JAS tries to make all their buildings energy efficient for lower long-term maintenance. Lower operating costs are critical to maintain reduced rents so a highly efficient envelope, lower energy consumption and LEED is what is being strived for. He stated that JAS will make this as efficient as possible and get to Net Zero and LEED Gold. Councillor Zondervan suggested considering making it Net Zero Ready because Net Zero is not a design standard. Net Zero cannot be verified until it is operating but if it is made Net Zero Ready will enable getting to Net Zero practice.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan spoke about slide 11 and wanted more detail on what is envisioned for the multi-use path and what will it be used for; how wide it is and is it just a bike path or is it truly a multi-use path. Mr. Boyes-Watson stated that it is a five-foot path by the side of the building. There is a wide unused berm, which is part of the Danehy Park design. What is being shown on the slide is that the berm will be an amenity; the petition will provide a five-foot pathway. He stated that there is a bigger opportunity here that is beyond the scope of this overlay and as a landscape architect he would be thinking creatively whether there can be more uses for the berm. Councillor Zondervan commented that five feet is not enough and wanted more work on this aspect. \n\nCouncillor Zondervan moved to slide 12. He asked if the stormwater can be captured and reused the same way as is done on the King School on Putnam Avenue. Mr. Boyes-Watson responded in the affirmative. He spoke about irrigation requirements and would definitely look toward doing this. Councillor Zondervan stated that on slide 14 regarding the parking, he noted that there were concerns raised at the Planning Board about making sure that the parking is secure for the affordable housing tenants. Mr. Boyes-Watson stated that there is nothing about the way the parking is designed that would not allow some type of gated access as long as it is compatible and further stated that because this is a mixed-use building accessibility is needed for the users of the gym and housing. Mr. Williams stated that one of the components of the self-storage business is secure and there are sixteen security cameras on site constantly surveilling; there is a record of all who enters or exists the site. Councillor Zondervan suggested a garage door that closed at midnight and some type of gated access. Mr. Nicholson stated that there is no gated parking at any JAS sites; there are security cameras; proper lighting and make it inhospitable for anyone to lurk.\n\nCouncillor Mallon asked for clarification on the AMI. She asked is it a minimum of 80% AMI for all the units. Mr. Nicholson responded that it is the maximum. Councillor Mallon asked did JAS look at this parcel when it was available for sale for affordable housing. Mr. Nicholson responded in the affirmative, but it was under agreement with SSG. He stated that an initial cursory look was done on the property. He stated that obviously with the full site there would be more affordable housing but would have to be fully born by the subsidies and rents by the housing. He stated that the request for the City and Affordable Housing Trust would have been more on a per unit basis than in a situation like this. He stated that regarding the timing it would take several years to get underway and to break ground. He stated that based on the scarcity of resources and process that needs to be undertaken with the state to get these resources granted to a project. Councillor Mallon commented that there is sentiment to have the whole site for affordable housing. \n\nShe asked if the traffic generation is the same as last year and will there be more traffic with the 15 units of housing. Mr. Williams responded that the traffic study has not been updated with the plan redesign. Councillor Mallon asked if the art mural wall was lost, which was on the original proposal. Mr. Bachrach stated that he is open to have an art wall and will be happy to work with the Arts Council. Councillor Mallon wanted the benefits for sports storage and family in transitions and asked why this is not listed on the public benefits. Mr. Bachrach stated that the focus is on the overlay district. He stated that he is committed to the public benefits as listed in the past and including the art wall, storage for sport facilities and families in transition. He proposed a green wall and if this petition goes forward this will be left up to the City on whether it wants a green wall or an art wall. Attorney Rafferty stated that in the petition in section 20.95.1 spells out the criteria for the Planning Board to evaluate an application for a special permit. He noted that # 2 is public benefits that will enhance the use of the adjoining Danehy Park. This was a way to capture this concept without specifically doing so. He stated that this could be subject to amendment. He stated that specifically number 4 goes to the provisions for affordable short-term storage. He commented that this has not fallen out of the petition. This was in the prior petition and is in this petition explicitly as criteria necessary to grant a special permit. \n\nVice Mayor Devereux asked what the total GFA is of this building that is available under the zoning. She noted that this is a substantial up zoning. Mr. Boyes-Watson stated that the components of project as drawn is just over 110,000 square feet of storage; 20,000 square feet of housing and 2,500 square foot for the gym. He stated that the parking for the housing is exempt but because of the flood plain all the housing would be exempt. Vice Mayor Devereux asked if the vision of the zoning goes lot line to lot line. Mr. Boyes-Watson stated that the building has setbacks on all sides. He stated that the illustrations show a building setback 5 feet everywhere with 10 feet on New Street in addition to the other bulk plane controls. Vice Mayor Devereux commented on a discrepancy that she sees in terms of this area described as unused park land along Danehy Park side shown on slide five. She stated that what is shown is a grassy lawn with some trees, but this is fenced off because it is a methane trench and it not open to the public. Mr. Watson stated that where the line of trees along the path is about 2 feet from the property line. Vice Mayor Devereux repeated that the other area does not exist; it is a methane trench and is fenced off for health and environment reasons. This path is not a realistic benefit unless the petitioner is going to give more of his land to create a desirable path. Attorney Rafferty stated that the path and its location was provided to the petitioners by the Envision Study. He stated that the location of the path in that area and image in the presentation shows the path was not a creation of the petitioners. He noted that this is the desired connection from the Envision Study. Vice Mayor Devereux stated that the path needs to be created on the land of this site because the public land is not available for a path. Gym windows will be looking at an embankment of the park and will not be looking at Danehy Park. \n\nCouncillor Kelley stated that this is a big ask for both height and FAR beyond what is allowed in current zoning. Attorney Rafferty stated that the current FAR would yield a building one-half the size of the proposed storage building. He stated that the petition is looking to increase the FAR to 3.0 and the current FAR is 1.25. This would not allow the 20,000 square feet of housing, which over and above the increased FAR permitted for the commercial building. This is 20,000 on housing side and on the storage side the square footage increase. Mr. Boyes-Watson stated that this calculation has not been done because there would be a bonus for the affordable component. He stated that if the site is 43,000 square feet the increase in GFA is worth 50,000. Councillor Kelley noted that this is a big thing for this area.\n\nCouncillor Siddiqui asked why they chose 15 housing units and if they had similar joint venture partnership in the portfolio before. Mr. Nicholson looked at joint ventures for developments but nothing as concrete as this proposal. He stated SSG decided to increase the housing and the 15 units is a factor in increasing the number for family sized units. Councillor Siddiqui asked if there is a mixed-used self-storage. Mr. Bacharach responded that he unaware of any-mixed use storage has been done anywhere in the country. He stated that he has done projects that included other uses. He spoke about a current project in Jamaica Plains where the City asked to have built a housing complex adjacent to the storage building he is building. A common parking lot is shared. \n\nCouncillor Carlone asked what the GFA storage size is. Mr. Boyes-Watson said 110,000 square feet. Councillor Carlone asked Mr. Nicholson about the statement that this is an unusual deal from an affordable housing perspective. He asked what the deal is. He asked if JAS is seeking funds to compliment what is being offered. Mr. Nicholson stated that JAS would act as a development consultant during the process and upon completion of the units JAS would purchase the units as a turnkey situation. He stated that JAS investment is time and a lump sum purchase of a finished project. He stated that in terms of cost he does not have the numbers and cannot say what levels of funding will be needed. The funding will involve a standard mortgage which the property would pay. He spoke about state subsidies that would be applied for. He stated that depending on the final numbers and through the City through the Affordable Housing Trust acted as a gap filler for this type of thing. He added in this scenario he does not know what the gap would be. Councillor Carlone stated that new unit locations could cost $100,000 - $200,000 per unit for the land and is there a benefit other than turnkey on a financial basis or a land value. Mr. Nicholson responded that a land value is being discussed but was not negotiated yet. The land value is significantly less than $100,000 - $200,000 per unit. Councillor Carlone noted that there needs to be a financial investment from both sides.\n\nCouncillor Carlone asked Mr. Roberts to come forward and discuss the Planning Board\u2019s comments. \n\nMr. Roberts stated that the Planning Board heard the current petition on June 4, 2019 and the original petition was not heard by the Planning Board last year due to scheduling complications. The Planning Board voted not to recommend the petition. He explained that the Planning Board had no concern with the self-storage as a use but had concerns conceptually. He stated that the Planning Board was receptive to some of the petitioner\u2019s descriptions of how this kind of use can work in a complimentary fashion to residential uses. He stated that the concerns of the Planning Board were with the notion of whether there should be such different treatment for self-storage uses on this particular site, rather than having criteria and standards for self-storage uses in all similarly zone districts of the City. \n\nHe stated that another Planning Board concern for this particular overlay district was about the overall commercial development scale that was being proposed and the impact it would have in an area that has begun to transition significantly from commercial to residential character. He stated that the Planning Board did hear the proposal with the additional affordable housing units and felt that this was an improvement to the proposal and going in the right direction. He noted that the petitioners did not assess the bulk control plane that was introduced in the interim but ultimately the Planning Board still felt that there were concerns about the overall scale in relation to surrounding areas such as the adjacent residential sites and Danehy Park and the impact. \n\nHe stated that from a site-specific point of view there were more concerns about project review concerning the path proposed along the side. The Planning Board wondered what the character and feel of the path would be considering it is in a low point of the park and the proposed self-storage use generating minimum activation in this area. Mr. Roberts noted that the Planning Board appreciated the suggestions in the petition about retail space on the ground floor would help to serve the continuation of the gym use on the site and that the adjacent site where this building is proposed could in the future be developed into housing in a way that will help to further visually screen the storage site but given the uncertainty of retail tenancy on a long-term basis as well as the uncertainty about what could actually happen on the adjacent site the Planning Board felt that it was hard to come to a conclusion based on these factors. He stated that this was the overall impression of the Planning Board. \n\nHe added that some Planning Board members noted that if this were to move forward that there are provisions in the language that the Planning Board suggested should be reviewed more carefully to make sure that the expectation and criteria are clear and consistent with other parts of the zoning ordinance which is recommended for any zoning proposal. \n\nCouncillor Mallon asked about the Planning Board\u2019s concerns about the path and the low activation and asked if the board felt that this would be unsafe. Mr. Roberts stated that this was part of the concern. He stated that the overall impression of the pathway that on one side would have a building with a self-storage use with no windows, except on the residential side, and would have uses with no windows looking down onto the path and then on the other side is the methane trench with the hill going up to the taller part of Danehy Park may feel like a closed off space. Ultimately it may be a space where individuals would feel uncomfortable being there.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux stated that the Planning Board unanimously voted not to forward this petition with an unfavorable recommendation. She stated that Ted Cohen felt it was close to spot zoning without any good planning rationale. Mr. Cohen noted that the environmental features are things that are currently required or will be soon. She added that Steve Cohen wondered why when the City is trying to incentivize housing, when it is already the emerging use and noted in Envision, why go in the other direction to up zone for a non-residential use. She stated that the City Council is being asked to change the zoning but this seems like it is going in the wrong direction. She stated that Mr. Bacci has questions related to security and how the storage would be used, and traffic was understated for the storage uses. She added that another Planning Board member commented on the blank tall wall looming over Danehy Park and Mr. Russell noted that the 65 feet would be overwhelming on the soccer field and had questions on the wording of the zoning petition. Vice Mayor Devereux stated that the Chair of the Planning Board was uncomfortable with the spot zoning and she felt that is one cannot tell if you are reviewing a project or zoning this is not in a good place. Vice Mayor Devereux commented that the City Council is not in a good place with this petition in terms of what it is trying to do from a planning standpoint. \n\nShe noted that the Planning Board is being asked repeatedly to approve up zoning and they commented at one of their meetings that the Board felt they were getting out of planning because everything was being negotiated on a parcel by parcel basis with potential community benefits that were often subject to letters of agreement or political negotiations in this City Council rather than with them. She stated that she is not comfortable doing planning this way. She spoke about the other parcel and the co-petitioner is a larger parcel than this one and do not know what this zoning would do for this owner and his intentions to redevelop this parcel. She stated that if this was being zoned for self-storage at a greater density the City should not be unhappy if he decides that a self-storage building is profitable and builds a large storage building and throw in housing. This would result in a large portion of New Street where it meets Bay State Road. She noted what has not been mentioned is that both lots back up onto Bay State Road that may one day want to be redeveloped but are not up zoned and currently some are residential at a low scale. She added from a planning standpoint why would the City Council do this and in particularly when the Planning Board has unanimously advised that they would not.\n\nCouncillor Carlone noted that the scheme has changed somewhat but may not satisfy issues such as the green wall and setback and windows at the top. \n\nCouncillor Kelley stated that he was confused with the establishment of the housing here impacts what would normally be paid into the linkage fee or does it. Mr. Roberts stated that the incentive zoning requirement would apply to commercial and non-residential uses above a certain size of development; 35,000 square feet or more. The commercial component has a per square foot contribution which goes to the Affordable Housing Trust and this is no provision and would not translate into a payment for these particular units. He noted that this would be a separate payment to the Affordable Housing Trust and would be under a separate agreement.\n\nCouncillor Carlone opened the hearing to public comment. No one signed up for public comment.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan asked what the term lease is for the Evolve gym. Mr. Williams stated that in the letter of intent with Evolve it is a 10-year term with 2 five-year renewal options. Councillor Zondervan asked who is paying for housing. Mr. Nicholson stated that the ultimate cost of housing will be dependent on the cost to build it. He stated that the price for the land is significantly reduced which is a benefit. He believed that the incentive zoning fee gets paid into the Affordable Housing Trust. He stated that as the Affordable Housing Trust is the typical gap filler for affordable housing projects in Cambridge and construction costs are still high with the reduced land what this gap will be needs to be filled. He stated that his estimation is that it will be significantly less that the gap that needs to be filled in a standard project. Councillor Zondervan asked what the land value contribution is. Mr. Nicholson stated that no final conclusion has been reached. He stated that he would like to look at the overall costs and see what exactly it must be from his perspective to make it all work out and make it a true benefit to the City. Councillor Zondervan stated that it is important for the City Council to know this because the only reason to approve this project is because it comes with affordable housing and if it did not the City Council would not approve this. He added that it is important for the City Council to understand this and what the City is getting. He added that if all that is happening here is that that affordable housing is being built under normal circumstances then the only real housing contribution is the land value which sounds like it is a discount and not be full value of the land. He stated that he wanted to know what this is. Mr. Nicholson then stated that this is more than a 50% discount on the land and considerably more. \n\nMr. Nicholson spoke about deals lost above the $200,000 per unit range. He stated that they have discussed a land price but if this continues to be lowered to make sure the deal works and provides the benefit that the petitioners are trying to commit to then the price of the land will continue to drop to ensure that the deal works. Councillor Zondervan noted that self-storage is not an ideal use in this neighborhood. He commended the developer for making sure that the gym can stay open. The partnership with JAS is significant; 15 units of affordable housing is significant. He added that more housing could be built on this site if there was no storage. He spoke about the other community benefits of the storage for transition families, sports storage and net zero building particularly if it includes housing. He noted that there is no true Net Zero housing in Cambridge yet. He stated that he understands and shares the concerns of the Planning Board because this is a massive up zoning and is very concerning but the developer has gone above and beyond and has set a high bar for the kind of up zoning that the City Council ought to consider. He is ready to support the project but wanted 3 items clearly specified in the zoning or the commitment letter to include:\n\nThat the entire building should be built to a Net Zero Ready standard;\n\nRetail space to continue to be retail or some other community space; no banks and no additional storage in the space; and\n\nA 5 feet path is not wide enough and wanted assurances that this will be top notch community path and that it would be a true benefit to the community. \n\nHe stated that other up zoning projects in the City provide little community benefit to the City and are not providing affordable housing. He added that this project is very different for these reasons.\n\nCouncillor Kelley stated that he shares Vice Mayor Devereux\u2019s concerns. He noted that he does not know what is being negotiated at this point. He stated that this is what the City Council seems to be doing a lot of. He shares the Planning Board concerns on doing one offs on specific things on a regular basis. He added Cambridge can buy and build its own sports storage for youth. He stated that he felt that the City Council is negotiating too much little stuff. He stated that he is concerned about how this continuously goes.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux stated that the path is a huge distraction. She stated that their land ends in the back yards of existing buildings on Bay State Road. There is no benefit to a path going from a part of Danehy Park that is not used and does not go anywhere; there is not connection that anyone is asking for and the security risks are real. She asked if the site has been evaluated under the proposed Affordable Housing Overlay by JAS. She stated that there could be a bigger building that could be entirely housing under the AHO. This building could be 80 feet tall and have many units and could continue to have a 2,500 square foot active studio gym. She commented that the current gym is 18,000 square feet and has child care and multi-class rooms. The proposal is a workout space but to call it a gym is a misnomer. Evolve gym users depending on the parking and this is not a transit friendly location; it is a car dominated area and reducing parking does not help this. She stated that if this an attractive area for housing she asked why the City is settling for 15 units of housing and the City is still contributing funds to this and is enabling this. She stated that the cost is too high on the rest of the planning goals and the surrounding neighborhoods. She urged the owner to come up with a better housing proposal for this site that is next to the park and is family friendly and environmentally sustainable. \n\nCouncillor Mallon spoke about the Pizzuto family, the former owner, who went to the self-storage group because they wanted a low impact, low traffic for this street. She noted that this is a major concern in this area about the traffic in this area. She noted that this began with a low impact traffic goal. She shared the Planning Board concerns about spot zoning, the parcel next door and what happens with this. Councillor Mallon stated that asking JAS to build 100% affordable housing for this site was not feasible based on timing and the finances needed. She stated that suggesting that this could be building under AHO, which has not been passed yet and may not happen. She commented that the land value is significant, and JAS has come before the City Council many times informing the City Council about how they were unable to bid on property because of the land price and the cost of building housing. This offers an opportunity to build affordable housing quickly. She stated that keeping Evolve, 15 units of affordable housing and low impact traffic on a s street which is being built up with residential housing and having commercial and residential on the same site that will keep the traffic low makes this project appealing. She expressed her gratitude to the petitioners for their work to make this project supportable. She stated that she is struggling with this. She asked Mr. Nicholson if it is possible under the AHO could this be 100% affordable housing in the future.\n\nMr. Nicholson stated that there could be a mechanism where that site becomes all housing but whether it would be all affordable housing or mixed income housing similar to the HRI project on Concord Avenue is hard to say at this point. He stated that the numbers were run 1.5 years ago, and they have not been run under the potential of the overlay zoning. He stated that this is an expensive project. It would involve 9% and 4% tax credits as well as a significant subsidy from the state and the City. He explained that 9% credits are very competitive and may take 2-3 years for this to be approved. He added that the process of entitling it under 40B involves a potential for various appeals and lawsuits associated with this because it would not be a by-right type of building in terms of parking ratio and setbacks looking to maximize the space. These are the difficult things that JAS does all the time, but it is not quick, and he cannot guarantee this, and it is not simple. This site can be all housing but will likely not be all affordable housing. \n\nCouncillor Mallon noted that there would have to be 75 units to get the amount needed for the incentive zoning. Vice Mayor Devereux stated that the HRI project on Concord Avenue it was stated that it was 98 units of affordable housing. Mr. Nicholson stated that there is mid-market component and there is a market rate component. He stated that there is a middle market that is outside of the standard structure and he thought that there was a market rate component. He explained how the 9% tax credits work. He stated that there is a sweet spot at about 45 units. Once above this the 9% tax credits are maxed out that can be applied to the building. Then you start with the 4% tax credit tier and this is about 3.25% and this is one-third of all the tax credits beyond this which means that this requires more subsidy. He explained that this is offset by having higher rents that the tax credits allow. Councillor Carlone added of the 98 units, 10 units are middle-income units. Councillor Mallon stated that the CDD\u2019s website states it is 98 units and all units will be affordable.\n\nCouncillor Siddiqui asked what is the public purpose to provide this type of use that has not been recognized. The petition has changed since June 4th and it does not feel as well thought out as it should or could be. She stated that to negotiate this way is difficult. \n\nCouncillor Carlone announced that the petitioners would like this to be moved forward because of a purchase and sale agreement.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that understanding the value of the affordable housing investment by petitioner is key. He noted that having access to land is a good thing. He stated that he would rather the gym space be a Pre-Kindergarten space, which is sorely lacking in Cambridge. He wanted this to be a true public benefit and understand the value of affordable housing investment. The impact of the project has been minimized by the design of project and the programming. He agreed that there are issues with the path, but the path was what Envision put on the site knowing that the methane was on this site. He stated that taking out the path will add more green. He stated that architecturally there are things that could minimize the massing. The set back on the roof with the top floor instead of being vertical could be treated like a roof on an angle so that the bulk plane is actually a metal roof instead of a metal facade which would make the appearance feel less overwhelming. He stated that most people would experience this from the soccer field which would reduce the overall building to about 30 feet. He commented that the solution from the street is good. The value of affordable housing investment has to be known for him to fully understand. He applauded the effort on the petition by the petitioners.\n\nMr. Nicholson spoke about the value of affordable housing. The land price is in the area of $50,000 per unit; this is a significant discount. He spoke about how the construction costs would be dealt with. He noted that the foundation, parking, and the podium that\u2019s the housing will be sitting on will be done by developer and there remove those costs. Only the stick-built component of the actual unit is what JAS would be buying. He stated that this is $2.5-$3 million of benefit and reduced cost for the affordable housing. He spoke about not having to do site work, podium, steel construction on this level is a significant discount on a per square foot price from overall construction. Councillor Carlone stated that this information needs to be formalized. \n\nCouncillor Kelley stated that he would feel better if someone with more knowledge about housing construction and affordable housing policy come to the City Council and state that this is a good deal. He commented that the proponents are good people and are proposing to do something that will be a big deal for them and it may be a great deal for the City of Cambridge. He stated that if we are going to do this we should be up front about the fact that whatever is done is a negotiating process. He stated that the zoning should not stay as it was written decades ago especially in a world that is evolving fast. He resents making judgments based on the money being saved per unit given the cost of the site and adding to this confusion about the placement of the path and the use of the path is troubling. He stated that this is not a comfortable discussion for him.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan stated that he is uncomfortable to negotiate with so little information. He suggested moving this forward without a recommendation and this will be before the City Council at the July 29th meeting and it will give petitioners time to address the concerns of the Ordinance Committee and provide information requested. This provides the City Council with the opportunity to fully weigh the cost and benefits of this project. He commented that as difficult it is for his colleagues to say yes to this project; it would also be difficult to say no to 15 units of affordable housing (20,000 square feet of affordable housing) because they are family units. He added that it is difficult for him to say to the first truly Net Zero project in Cambridge. He stated that he would like to see the whole site be affordable housing but short of the City Council rezoning this it cannot be guaranteed. \n\nVice Mayor Devereux stated that the City Council is perfectly willing to rezone for developers and cannot see why not rezone for the City. She stated that with the current FAR at 1.25 there could be 55,000 square feet of storage would be allowed on this size lot and with this petition it is being doubled at 110,000 square feet. She felt that there could be more housing. She commented that 20,000 square feet is a small amount of the total square footage. She stated that they are getting a bonus. She stated that she does not know what commercially viable is as stated in the petition. The City Council is up-zoning something without enough information. She asked the Clerk to outline the procedural aspect of the petition in relation to the summer meeting. In response to the question by Vice Mayor Devereux, Ms. Lopez stated that the Committee Report would be on the agenda for the July 29th City Council Meeting. She stated that the decision of what to do with this petition is up to the City Council. This could be passed to a second reading at the July 29th meeting and then there is time from the July 29th meeting to September 24 to further negotiate or discuss more with the petitioner before ordination. \n\nCouncillor Kelley spoke about a zoning petition to up zone the quadrangle and there will be benefits associated with this and there may be benefits associated with other zoning proposal as well. He stated that this is the way that business is done but he would like to know that the City Council is confident if this gets passed that the hardest and best bargain has been received on behalf of the City. \n\nAttorney Rafferty stated that the petitioners are willing to provide the information requested by the City Council and to work further on the MOU with JAS. He stated that the calendar reality is that if the petition does not leave the Ordinance Committee in time for the opportunity to be on the July 29th agenda the petition would run out of time to do the substantive work. He stated that hearing the concerns expressed, particularly on the path, the petitioners will go back to CDD to discuss the benefits of the path. Other than the width there may be other short comings with the path that will make it not viable. He noted that there is time between now and the July 29th meeting and between the July 29th meeting and the expiration date of the petition. He noted that if this is not referred to City Council for July 29th Special City Council meeting there will be no time for further discussion about this opportunity. He stated that the one consensus he is hearing from the City Council is that this does represent an opportunity and if this is an opportunity worth exploring the petitioners would welcome the chance to continue to work with the staff to provide the details needed to get the City Council in a position of knowledge, particularly on the cost of construction. He stated that with the presence of JAS there is experience with building housing. He stated that there is credibility and a track record that can be built upon with providing the City Council with additional information.\n\nCouncillor Kelley moved to refer the petition to the full City Council without a recommendation.  The motion carried on a voice vote six members. Vice Mayor Devereux was recorded in negative.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that information is being requested to further understand the value that is being generated that JAS or another non-profit will be able to count on. He requested more understanding on architecture and quality of finishes so that it is a positive addition to the street. Vice Mayor Devereux regarding the renderings wanted to see views not from above but from all side and there will be blank walls that are facing Bay State Road. Councillor Carlone commented that if this use is going to be it has to be a positive on all sides. \n\nVice Mayor Devereux noted that the Planning Board mentioned that the language in the petition was unclear. She made the following motion:\n\nORDERED: That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to instruct the  Community Development Department to revise the language in the  New Street Overlay petition and to include in the revision the  following changes:\n\n20.95.1 (1) by striking out 8,000 and inserting 20,000 square feet; \n\n20.94.1 and 20.96.1 entitled Maximum Height be amended by adding  at the end the words \u201cprovided, however that no building shall exceed  55 feet without complying with a 45-degree bulk plain.\u201d\n\nThe question now came on the motion and the motion carried on a voice vote of seven members.\n\nThe following communication was received and made part of the report.\n\nRobin Bonner, 15 Corporal Burns Road, urging the Ordinance Committee not to approve the petition (ATTACHMENT C).\n\nCouncillor Carlone and Councillor Kelley thanked all those present for their attendance.\n\nThe hearing adjourned at 5:46 PM.\n\nFor the Committee,\n\n__________________________________\n\nCouncillor Dennis J.

Carlone Co-Chair and Councillor Craig A. Kelley, Co-Chair of the Ordinance Committee, for a public hearing held on June 26, 2019 to discuss a petition received from Self Storage Group, LLC to amend the Zoning Ordinance by creating a New Street Overlay District. \n\nORDINANCE COMMITTEE MEMBERS Councillor Dennis J.

Denise SimmonsCouncillor Quinton Zondervan| In City Council July 29, 2019  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Ordinance Committee, comprised of the entire membership of the City Council, held a public hearing on June 26, 2019 at 3:35 PM in the Sullivan Chamber. \n\nThe purpose of the hearing was to discuss a petition received from Self Storage Group, LLC to amend the Zoning Ordinance by creating a New Street Overlay District (ATTACHMENT A).\n\nPresent at the hearing were Councillor Carlone and Councillor Kelley, Co-Chairs of the Committee, Vice Mayor Devereux, Councillor Mallon, Councillor Siddiqui, Councillor Toomey, Councillor Zondervan, Director of Zoning and Development Jeff Roberts\n\nand Donna P. Lopez, City Clerk\u2019s Office.\n\nAlso present were Attorney James Rafferty, 907 Massachusetts Avenue, co-petitioners of Self Storage Group, LLC (SSG) David M. Williams, Director of Development, SSG Development and Construction, 129 South Street, Fourth Floor, Boston and\n\nGeorge A. Bachrach, Principal, David Fulton, Mark Boyes-Watson, architect for the project and Craig Nicholson, Just-A-Start (JAS).\n\nCouncillor Carlone convened the hearing and stated the purpose. He announced that the hearing was being audio and video recorded. He outlined the format of the hearing: petitioners, staff, clarifying question session, public comment and the Ordinance Committee will discuss the petition and come to a conclusion and make a recommendation.\n\nAttorney James Rafferty spoke on behalf of the co-petitioners SSG, the owner of one of the parcels, and present from SSG is David Williams, George Bachrach and David Fulton. The architect for project, Mark Boyes Watson, is present. He stated that this is a petition that is being jointly filed by the owners of two parcels that are contained in the proposed New Street Overlay District. This is a refiled petition and the original petition did not advance beyond the Ordinance committee. He stated that with lessons learned from the original petition and feedback received, the property owner went back and analyzed the entire program. He noted that the overriding message that was heard from the last presentation was the need to create more of an active and mixed-use environment on New Street. He explained that the prior proposal allowed for an increase in density and height for this newly created use. The petition creates a new category of storage. He stated that the current storage is treated with no distinction in the table of uses between a warehouse that would accommodate all types of truck traffic and uses typically associated with storage warehouses, versus self-storage which is a consumer-oriented establishment. He stated that the representatives from SSG can tell more about self-storage which has a number of benefits and attributes that are stabilizing forces in residential communities. He stated that this is the goal sought by the proponents that believe that this location will benefit greatly from the type of business that they provide. \n\nFrom a zoning perspective Rafferty said there are three changes to the petition that are noteworthy. He stated that the first change is the criteria that would be imposed on any application for a special permit to allow for additional height and would not include a requirement affordable housing. He noted that there was no housing proposed in the prior petition. He continued that the petition in its current form in Section 20.95.1 (1) The first criteria talks about a minimum of 8,000 square feet of affordable housing. The proponents have modified and will show a plan to include 20,000 square feet of affordable housing and petitioners are pleased to report that they have entered a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Just-A-Start (JAS). Attorney Rafferty announced that Mr. Nicholson from JAS is here to discuss this joint venture agreement that they intend to pursue where JAS experience, expertise and knowledge in affordable housing will be put to good use here. He stated that JAS will own and control this affordable housing. He added that the design of the housing has become a critical aspect of mitigating the impact of the building. The architect will demonstrate how the housing use at this site can be compatible and can serve as a softening of the building edge as it approaches the street. \n\nHe stated that the other notable amendment that would be sought by the applicant would involve the height dimension. This is in Section 20.96 and the language of the petition states that the maximum height for the petition could be 65 feet. They are proposing an amendment that there would be a bulk plane requirement, a requirement that exists in many zonings and overlay districts in the City. He explained that at the 55-foot height the building on all four sides will have to step back at a 45-degree angle from 55 to 65 feet. He stated that this has the effect of reducing the mass of the building both as the building is seen on New Street and from Danehy Park. He noted that these are the two substantive changes. \n\nRafferty stated that the third component of petition that there is an area of 2,500 square feet devoted to retail use. He noted that the intention is for the Evolve Gym to have a facility. He stated that Mr. Bachrach can go through the details of the arrangements. The Evolve Gym is now a tenant at will and their lease expired at the end of December 2018 and the owner of the building is fully intent on selling the building. He noted that it has been a case that the Evolve Gym\u2019s long-term use at the site is very limited. He explained that an arrangement has been made that the proponents will build out a space for Evolve at a size that will work for the gym, although it is a different size. He stated that the size was the subject of negotiations with Evolve and the rental rate for the space will be a below market rate in an effort to keep this component an active use in the building. The hope is that Evolve will remain for a long time. The scaling back of the proposed height and the introduction of the gym are two of the changes. \n\nRafferty stated that the Planning Board\u2019s presentation did not include the bulk plane restrictions nor the increase in the amount of affordable housing. He noted that there are components of the petition that are very different than what the Planning Board evaluated. \n\nHe stated that Mr. Boyes-Watson will present some visual elements of this presentation that would turn the text of the petition into an understanding of what can be built at the site. He commented that it has been an effective collaboration with Mr. Boyes-Watson and JAS on how to optimize housing at this location, creating the type of unit size that would be most affected. He spoke about the obvious adjacency to a large recreational facility, walking distance to an elementary school makes this a very attractive housing location for families and the fact that there are residential uses emerging on the other side of New Street. He addressed the comment about why the overlay district only encompasses one side of the street. He responded that this is a function of reality. The other side of the street has an existing residential building already underway and it did not make sense to include those parcels in the overlay district because it was unlikely to see much change in those buildings. He stated that the other element of the petition that is new to the petition addresses a consistent theme with the Envision Planning in the Alewife Area. He stated that the idea to find locations in emerging mixed-use districts within Alewife where additional housing could be permitted. He stated that the petition does contain language that Mr. Markarian (owner of adjacent site) or his successor to be motivated to convert the automotive and the light industrial uses to housing. This is to incentivize housing on this side of New Street. He stated that regarding the site presentation there is an opportunity to make the connection on land owned by the petitioner to the back end of Danehy Park. At this time Mr. Boyes-Watson gave his presentation.\n\nMark Boyes-Watson, architect, spoke about the overarching urban design of the overlay by viewing slides, including existing conditions and some of the proposed streetscape design, to see if New Street can with the change in zoning become what it seems to want to become, which is more of a housing street and less a street of a strange mixture of uses that it is today. He stated that with the changes New Street can become a mixture of housing. He gave a presentation (ATTACHMENT B) of the overall building that incorporates housing along New Street, which is accessible on the ground floor. One of the slides begins to show the relationship is of the housing to the storage building. He stated that there is a planted setback on the New Street level before Danehy Park rises. The building is raised out of the ground because it is in a flood zone. He spoke about the bulk plane setting the top story back and it is more than a 45-degree bulk control plane on New Street. He stated that the top floor of the storage building starts 40 feet back and the public will not be aware of the upper top story when on New Street. \n\nHe stated that the parking is concealed inside the building. This parking is also for the housing and gym. He noted that the storage space is a low traffic generation and does not require parking; it is used intermittently and there is a modest loading zone. The gym has windows that look out onto Danehy Park. \n\nThere is a proposed bike and pedestrian pathway. Watson spoke about a storage facility for sports equipment because there is a shortage of storage at Danehy Park. This is accessed off the pedestrian pathway. He stated that the housing is used as the primary street frontage for New Street. He stated that the storage facility has a green wall design and a gallery of windows overlooking Danehy Park and the upper setback story of the storage facility is setback 45 feet. He stated that additional plant material will be introduced on the site. He stated that there are existing trees along the border and on the park edge. He stated that a robust row of trees will be planted down the property line. He explained that the intention of this building is to get to Net Zero and the storage area is energy efficient. He stated that combining the large roof and the well-designed envelope it is expected that this building can be both the equivalent of LEED Gold and Net Zero. \n\nThe proposed building is creating a more consistent urban form down this side of New Street as is the HRI building (now under construction) that overlooks Fresh Pond. He stated that the creation of these units of affordable housing is an appropriate urban design response to this location. He spoke about the traffic at the site. He stated that the self-storage use is one of the lowest traffic generators. He stated that the 2070 compliance is for the flood and storm water requirements and currently the site tends to flood but a storage infiltration system can be designed that sits under the parking level to deal with this. The site can be designed to mitigate environmental conditions and this is a great advantage. \n\nCraig Nicholson, JAS, stated that JAS was approached by SSG to work with them on the affordable housing component for this site. JAS entered into a MOU and upon this project going forward JAS would be in a position to take over the housing component, own it, keep it permanently affordable, manage it and maintain it in the same fashion as JAS does for the rest of its portfolio. He commented that the inclusion of affordable housing in the project is a creative way to take something that could just become a commercial component and have some inclusionary money sent into the trust fund. Hopefully it would get used in the right place and right time, but put it into a situation where housing definitely gets built and by having it be a mixed used building where the entire front of the building is housing there is no possibility that there will be only a storage structure without housing up front. This is unique and a way to ideally and ultimately create affordable housing at less cost than if it were an open market transaction. He added that JAS is excited to partner with SSG on this. \n\nHe stated that a 20,000 square foot building would yield approximately 20 units, but in this scenario, we are looking for less than 20 units because the goal is predominantly family size units. He outlined the units as 20% of the units would be 3-bedroom units and 60% of the units would be 2-bedroom units and on the affordability level would be looking for more of a moderate affordability at 80%. He spoke about the typical family size that occupies a 1, 2- or 3-bedroom units, which would bring families into this neighborhood next to Danehy Park with the moderate affordability at the 80% AMI. This is very difficult to achieve in Cambridge. He stated that a lot of the programs for new construction for affordable housing requires tax credits, which puts this tier significantly lower and creates a gap in the middle. He noted that this unique situation where housing can be created without the same overly heavily subsidized tax credit type of approach creates a moderate tier for ideally working families within Cambridge is something that JAS is excited to be a part of. \n\nMr. Bachrach stated that he is proud of the work being done with JAS and the efforts to accommodate the gym. He stated that much was learned at the Planning Board hearing which did not go well and as a result significant changes were made to the design to reduce the height, allow setbacks so that you are looking at four-story building from the front of the building. He stated that the self-storage business is nothing more than a neighborhood closet. He stated that 75% of customers are residential and 25% of customers are small businesses and all from the immediate neighborhood. He stated that this industry helps to stabilize neighborhoods. He spoke about small businesses that run out of storage space and cannot afford to rent larger space at $30 a square foot in Cambridge so they come to the storage space at $2 a square foot to off-load their back-office inventory or record keeping and are able to stay in the neighborhood. He cited other examples where storage space is needed. He stated that this is a local amenity with low traffic and uses less water than a single-family home. \n\nHe stated that in terms of the public benefits if approved the project would provide storage space for families in transition who are at risk of losing their possessions, storage space for athletic equipment used at Danehy Park and the pedestrian and bike path along the Danehy Park side of the building. He stated that he is proud of the proposed rooftop solar field, which will the largest private solar field in the City. He stated that he hopes to do more as time goes by with more community input into this process which is only at the early stage. He expects to get more input if given the opportunity to proceed. \n\nCouncillor Carlone asked if there are any clarifying questions.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan stated that storage does not require parking, just the loading. He asked if all the parking is for the housing and the gym. Mr. Williams stated that the storage does need a little parking. He added that most of the activity happens in the loading area. He stated that when a customer comes to a storage facility they park, go into the office and arrange for a contract and when they go to use the storage facility by either taking possessions in or out of the storage unit they park in the loading area and go in and out; there is a low parking need for this type of building. Councillor Zondervan asked could there be less parking. Mr. Williams said this parking will support the housing, the gym and the storage. He stated that there is an allowance of 5-7 spaces for the gym and 7-8 spaces for the 15 units of housing for a total of 20 parking spaces in the parking field. \n\nAttorney Rafferty said the petition proposes that the parking requirement for dwelling units be reduced from the current l in the district to .75 so the residential parking is being scaled back. He explained that Mr. Nicholson has stated throughout his portfolio there are many households without cars. Councillor Zondervan commented that he is in favor of reducing this to zero. He asked if this can be constructed in such a way that the parking can be reclaimed in the future if it is determined that the parking is not needed. Mr. Williams responded in the affirmative. \n\nCouncillor Zondervan asked if there is another floor above and referenced slide 7. Mr. Williams stated that this is showing a typical upper floor. This floor plan would be for floors 2, 3 and 4 of the housing and storage. The fifth-floor storage would be a smaller footprint because it is set back.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan stated that on slide 9 he questioned LEED Gold and Net Zero and stated that this felt tentative. Mr. Boyes-Watson spoke of the design being changed and the roof shrinking. He noted that the housing does use more energy than the storage facility. He stated that he was trying not to over promise. Mr. Williams stated that on the original design from last year calculations were done and they were able to get the storage building at the Net Zero classification. He noted that the design has evolved with input and the roof for the self-storage has shrunk with the inclusion of the housing. He stated that all the calculations have not been finished with the modified design. He stated that he felt confident that they can get a large solar field on the fourth floor of the roof and parts of the fifth floor of the roof and the housing has not been analyzed to see how a component could work with this. He stated that this goal is important to the petitioners. Mr. Nicholson stated that JAS tries to make all their buildings energy efficient for lower long-term maintenance. Lower operating costs are critical to maintain reduced rents so a highly efficient envelope, lower energy consumption and LEED is what is being strived for. He stated that JAS will make this as efficient as possible and get to Net Zero and LEED Gold. Councillor Zondervan suggested considering making it Net Zero Ready because Net Zero is not a design standard. Net Zero cannot be verified until it is operating but if it is made Net Zero Ready will enable getting to Net Zero practice.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan spoke about slide 11 and wanted more detail on what is envisioned for the multi-use path and what will it be used for; how wide it is and is it just a bike path or is it truly a multi-use path. Mr. Boyes-Watson stated that it is a five-foot path by the side of the building. There is a wide unused berm, which is part of the Danehy Park design. What is being shown on the slide is that the berm will be an amenity; the petition will provide a five-foot pathway. He stated that there is a bigger opportunity here that is beyond the scope of this overlay and as a landscape architect he would be thinking creatively whether there can be more uses for the berm. Councillor Zondervan commented that five feet is not enough and wanted more work on this aspect. \n\nCouncillor Zondervan moved to slide 12. He asked if the stormwater can be captured and reused the same way as is done on the King School on Putnam Avenue. Mr. Boyes-Watson responded in the affirmative. He spoke about irrigation requirements and would definitely look toward doing this. Councillor Zondervan stated that on slide 14 regarding the parking, he noted that there were concerns raised at the Planning Board about making sure that the parking is secure for the affordable housing tenants. Mr. Boyes-Watson stated that there is nothing about the way the parking is designed that would not allow some type of gated access as long as it is compatible and further stated that because this is a mixed-use building accessibility is needed for the users of the gym and housing. Mr. Williams stated that one of the components of the self-storage business is secure and there are sixteen security cameras on site constantly surveilling; there is a record of all who enters or exists the site. Councillor Zondervan suggested a garage door that closed at midnight and some type of gated access. Mr. Nicholson stated that there is no gated parking at any JAS sites; there are security cameras; proper lighting and make it inhospitable for anyone to lurk.\n\nCouncillor Mallon asked for clarification on the AMI. She asked is it a minimum of 80% AMI for all the units. Mr. Nicholson responded that it is the maximum. Councillor Mallon asked did JAS look at this parcel when it was available for sale for affordable housing. Mr. Nicholson responded in the affirmative, but it was under agreement with SSG. He stated that an initial cursory look was done on the property. He stated that obviously with the full site there would be more affordable housing but would have to be fully born by the subsidies and rents by the housing. He stated that the request for the City and Affordable Housing Trust would have been more on a per unit basis than in a situation like this. He stated that regarding the timing it would take several years to get underway and to break ground. He stated that based on the scarcity of resources and process that needs to be undertaken with the state to get these resources granted to a project. Councillor Mallon commented that there is sentiment to have the whole site for affordable housing. \n\nShe asked if the traffic generation is the same as last year and will there be more traffic with the 15 units of housing. Mr. Williams responded that the traffic study has not been updated with the plan redesign. Councillor Mallon asked if the art mural wall was lost, which was on the original proposal. Mr. Bachrach stated that he is open to have an art wall and will be happy to work with the Arts Council. Councillor Mallon wanted the benefits for sports storage and family in transitions and asked why this is not listed on the public benefits. Mr. Bachrach stated that the focus is on the overlay district. He stated that he is committed to the public benefits as listed in the past and including the art wall, storage for sport facilities and families in transition. He proposed a green wall and if this petition goes forward this will be left up to the City on whether it wants a green wall or an art wall. Attorney Rafferty stated that in the petition in section 20.95.1 spells out the criteria for the Planning Board to evaluate an application for a special permit. He noted that # 2 is public benefits that will enhance the use of the adjoining Danehy Park. This was a way to capture this concept without specifically doing so. He stated that this could be subject to amendment. He stated that specifically number 4 goes to the provisions for affordable short-term storage. He commented that this has not fallen out of the petition. This was in the prior petition and is in this petition explicitly as criteria necessary to grant a special permit. \n\nVice Mayor Devereux asked what the total GFA is of this building that is available under the zoning. She noted that this is a substantial up zoning. Mr. Boyes-Watson stated that the components of project as drawn is just over 110,000 square feet of storage; 20,000 square feet of housing and 2,500 square foot for the gym. He stated that the parking for the housing is exempt but because of the flood plain all the housing would be exempt. Vice Mayor Devereux asked if the vision of the zoning goes lot line to lot line. Mr. Boyes-Watson stated that the building has setbacks on all sides. He stated that the illustrations show a building setback 5 feet everywhere with 10 feet on New Street in addition to the other bulk plane controls. Vice Mayor Devereux commented on a discrepancy that she sees in terms of this area described as unused park land along Danehy Park side shown on slide five. She stated that what is shown is a grassy lawn with some trees, but this is fenced off because it is a methane trench and it not open to the public. Mr. Watson stated that where the line of trees along the path is about 2 feet from the property line. Vice Mayor Devereux repeated that the other area does not exist; it is a methane trench and is fenced off for health and environment reasons. This path is not a realistic benefit unless the petitioner is going to give more of his land to create a desirable path. Attorney Rafferty stated that the path and its location was provided to the petitioners by the Envision Study. He stated that the location of the path in that area and image in the presentation shows the path was not a creation of the petitioners. He noted that this is the desired connection from the Envision Study. Vice Mayor Devereux stated that the path needs to be created on the land of this site because the public land is not available for a path. Gym windows will be looking at an embankment of the park and will not be looking at Danehy Park. \n\nCouncillor Kelley stated that this is a big ask for both height and FAR beyond what is allowed in current zoning. Attorney Rafferty stated that the current FAR would yield a building one-half the size of the proposed storage building. He stated that the petition is looking to increase the FAR to 3.0 and the current FAR is 1.25. This would not allow the 20,000 square feet of housing, which over and above the increased FAR permitted for the commercial building. This is 20,000 on housing side and on the storage side the square footage increase. Mr. Boyes-Watson stated that this calculation has not been done because there would be a bonus for the affordable component. He stated that if the site is 43,000 square feet the increase in GFA is worth 50,000. Councillor Kelley noted that this is a big thing for this area.\n\nCouncillor Siddiqui asked why they chose 15 housing units and if they had similar joint venture partnership in the portfolio before. Mr. Nicholson looked at joint ventures for developments but nothing as concrete as this proposal. He stated SSG decided to increase the housing and the 15 units is a factor in increasing the number for family sized units. Councillor Siddiqui asked if there is a mixed-used self-storage. Mr. Bacharach responded that he unaware of any-mixed use storage has been done anywhere in the country. He stated that he has done projects that included other uses. He spoke about a current project in Jamaica Plains where the City asked to have built a housing complex adjacent to the storage building he is building. A common parking lot is shared. \n\nCouncillor Carlone asked what the GFA storage size is. Mr. Boyes-Watson said 110,000 square feet. Councillor Carlone asked Mr. Nicholson about the statement that this is an unusual deal from an affordable housing perspective. He asked what the deal is. He asked if JAS is seeking funds to compliment what is being offered. Mr. Nicholson stated that JAS would act as a development consultant during the process and upon completion of the units JAS would purchase the units as a turnkey situation. He stated that JAS investment is time and a lump sum purchase of a finished project. He stated that in terms of cost he does not have the numbers and cannot say what levels of funding will be needed. The funding will involve a standard mortgage which the property would pay. He spoke about state subsidies that would be applied for. He stated that depending on the final numbers and through the City through the Affordable Housing Trust acted as a gap filler for this type of thing. He added in this scenario he does not know what the gap would be. Councillor Carlone stated that new unit locations could cost $100,000 - $200,000 per unit for the land and is there a benefit other than turnkey on a financial basis or a land value. Mr. Nicholson responded that a land value is being discussed but was not negotiated yet. The land value is significantly less than $100,000 - $200,000 per unit. Councillor Carlone noted that there needs to be a financial investment from both sides.\n\nCouncillor Carlone asked Mr. Roberts to come forward and discuss the Planning Board\u2019s comments. \n\nMr. Roberts stated that the Planning Board heard the current petition on June 4, 2019 and the original petition was not heard by the Planning Board last year due to scheduling complications. The Planning Board voted not to recommend the petition. He explained that the Planning Board had no concern with the self-storage as a use but had concerns conceptually. He stated that the Planning Board was receptive to some of the petitioner\u2019s descriptions of how this kind of use can work in a complimentary fashion to residential uses. He stated that the concerns of the Planning Board were with the notion of whether there should be such different treatment for self-storage uses on this particular site, rather than having criteria and standards for self-storage uses in all similarly zone districts of the City. \n\nHe stated that another Planning Board concern for this particular overlay district was about the overall commercial development scale that was being proposed and the impact it would have in an area that has begun to transition significantly from commercial to residential character. He stated that the Planning Board did hear the proposal with the additional affordable housing units and felt that this was an improvement to the proposal and going in the right direction. He noted that the petitioners did not assess the bulk control plane that was introduced in the interim but ultimately the Planning Board still felt that there were concerns about the overall scale in relation to surrounding areas such as the adjacent residential sites and Danehy Park and the impact. \n\nHe stated that from a site-specific point of view there were more concerns about project review concerning the path proposed along the side. The Planning Board wondered what the character and feel of the path would be considering it is in a low point of the park and the proposed self-storage use generating minimum activation in this area. Mr. Roberts noted that the Planning Board appreciated the suggestions in the petition about retail space on the ground floor would help to serve the continuation of the gym use on the site and that the adjacent site where this building is proposed could in the future be developed into housing in a way that will help to further visually screen the storage site but given the uncertainty of retail tenancy on a long-term basis as well as the uncertainty about what could actually happen on the adjacent site the Planning Board felt that it was hard to come to a conclusion based on these factors. He stated that this was the overall impression of the Planning Board. \n\nHe added that some Planning Board members noted that if this were to move forward that there are provisions in the language that the Planning Board suggested should be reviewed more carefully to make sure that the expectation and criteria are clear and consistent with other parts of the zoning ordinance which is recommended for any zoning proposal. \n\nCouncillor Mallon asked about the Planning Board\u2019s concerns about the path and the low activation and asked if the board felt that this would be unsafe. Mr. Roberts stated that this was part of the concern. He stated that the overall impression of the pathway that on one side would have a building with a self-storage use with no windows, except on the residential side, and would have uses with no windows looking down onto the path and then on the other side is the methane trench with the hill going up to the taller part of Danehy Park may feel like a closed off space. Ultimately it may be a space where individuals would feel uncomfortable being there.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux stated that the Planning Board unanimously voted not to forward this petition with an unfavorable recommendation. She stated that Ted Cohen felt it was close to spot zoning without any good planning rationale. Mr. Cohen noted that the environmental features are things that are currently required or will be soon. She added that Steve Cohen wondered why when the City is trying to incentivize housing, when it is already the emerging use and noted in Envision, why go in the other direction to up zone for a non-residential use. She stated that the City Council is being asked to change the zoning but this seems like it is going in the wrong direction. She stated that Mr. Bacci has questions related to security and how the storage would be used, and traffic was understated for the storage uses. She added that another Planning Board member commented on the blank tall wall looming over Danehy Park and Mr. Russell noted that the 65 feet would be overwhelming on the soccer field and had questions on the wording of the zoning petition. Vice Mayor Devereux stated that the Chair of the Planning Board was uncomfortable with the spot zoning and she felt that is one cannot tell if you are reviewing a project or zoning this is not in a good place. Vice Mayor Devereux commented that the City Council is not in a good place with this petition in terms of what it is trying to do from a planning standpoint. \n\nShe noted that the Planning Board is being asked repeatedly to approve up zoning and they commented at one of their meetings that the Board felt they were getting out of planning because everything was being negotiated on a parcel by parcel basis with potential community benefits that were often subject to letters of agreement or political negotiations in this City Council rather than with them. She stated that she is not comfortable doing planning this way. She spoke about the other parcel and the co-petitioner is a larger parcel than this one and do not know what this zoning would do for this owner and his intentions to redevelop this parcel. She stated that if this was being zoned for self-storage at a greater density the City should not be unhappy if he decides that a self-storage building is profitable and builds a large storage building and throw in housing. This would result in a large portion of New Street where it meets Bay State Road. She noted what has not been mentioned is that both lots back up onto Bay State Road that may one day want to be redeveloped but are not up zoned and currently some are residential at a low scale. She added from a planning standpoint why would the City Council do this and in particularly when the Planning Board has unanimously advised that they would not.\n\nCouncillor Carlone noted that the scheme has changed somewhat but may not satisfy issues such as the green wall and setback and windows at the top. \n\nCouncillor Kelley stated that he was confused with the establishment of the housing here impacts what would normally be paid into the linkage fee or does it. Mr. Roberts stated that the incentive zoning requirement would apply to commercial and non-residential uses above a certain size of development; 35,000 square feet or more. The commercial component has a per square foot contribution which goes to the Affordable Housing Trust and this is no provision and would not translate into a payment for these particular units. He noted that this would be a separate payment to the Affordable Housing Trust and would be under a separate agreement.\n\nCouncillor Carlone opened the hearing to public comment. No one signed up for public comment.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan asked what the term lease is for the Evolve gym. Mr. Williams stated that in the letter of intent with Evolve it is a 10-year term with 2 five-year renewal options. Councillor Zondervan asked who is paying for housing. Mr. Nicholson stated that the ultimate cost of housing will be dependent on the cost to build it. He stated that the price for the land is significantly reduced which is a benefit. He believed that the incentive zoning fee gets paid into the Affordable Housing Trust. He stated that as the Affordable Housing Trust is the typical gap filler for affordable housing projects in Cambridge and construction costs are still high with the reduced land what this gap will be needs to be filled. He stated that his estimation is that it will be significantly less that the gap that needs to be filled in a standard project. Councillor Zondervan asked what the land value contribution is. Mr. Nicholson stated that no final conclusion has been reached. He stated that he would like to look at the overall costs and see what exactly it must be from his perspective to make it all work out and make it a true benefit to the City. Councillor Zondervan stated that it is important for the City Council to know this because the only reason to approve this project is because it comes with affordable housing and if it did not the City Council would not approve this. He added that it is important for the City Council to understand this and what the City is getting. He added that if all that is happening here is that that affordable housing is being built under normal circumstances then the only real housing contribution is the land value which sounds like it is a discount and not be full value of the land. He stated that he wanted to know what this is. Mr. Nicholson then stated that this is more than a 50% discount on the land and considerably more. \n\nMr. Nicholson spoke about deals lost above the $200,000 per unit range. He stated that they have discussed a land price but if this continues to be lowered to make sure the deal works and provides the benefit that the petitioners are trying to commit to then the price of the land will continue to drop to ensure that the deal works. Councillor Zondervan noted that self-storage is not an ideal use in this neighborhood. He commended the developer for making sure that the gym can stay open. The partnership with JAS is significant; 15 units of affordable housing is significant. He added that more housing could be built on this site if there was no storage. He spoke about the other community benefits of the storage for transition families, sports storage and net zero building particularly if it includes housing. He noted that there is no true Net Zero housing in Cambridge yet. He stated that he understands and shares the concerns of the Planning Board because this is a massive up zoning and is very concerning but the developer has gone above and beyond and has set a high bar for the kind of up zoning that the City Council ought to consider. He is ready to support the project but wanted 3 items clearly specified in the zoning or the commitment letter to include:\n\nThat the entire building should be built to a Net Zero Ready standard;\n\nRetail space to continue to be retail or some other community space; no banks and no additional storage in the space; and\n\nA 5 feet path is not wide enough and wanted assurances that this will be top notch community path and that it would be a true benefit to the community. \n\nHe stated that other up zoning projects in the City provide little community benefit to the City and are not providing affordable housing. He added that this project is very different for these reasons.\n\nCouncillor Kelley stated that he shares Vice Mayor Devereux\u2019s concerns. He noted that he does not know what is being negotiated at this point. He stated that this is what the City Council seems to be doing a lot of. He shares the Planning Board concerns on doing one offs on specific things on a regular basis. He added Cambridge can buy and build its own sports storage for youth. He stated that he felt that the City Council is negotiating too much little stuff. He stated that he is concerned about how this continuously goes.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux stated that the path is a huge distraction. She stated that their land ends in the back yards of existing buildings on Bay State Road. There is no benefit to a path going from a part of Danehy Park that is not used and does not go anywhere; there is not connection that anyone is asking for and the security risks are real. She asked if the site has been evaluated under the proposed Affordable Housing Overlay by JAS. She stated that there could be a bigger building that could be entirely housing under the AHO. This building could be 80 feet tall and have many units and could continue to have a 2,500 square foot active studio gym. She commented that the current gym is 18,000 square feet and has child care and multi-class rooms. The proposal is a workout space but to call it a gym is a misnomer. Evolve gym users depending on the parking and this is not a transit friendly location; it is a car dominated area and reducing parking does not help this. She stated that if this an attractive area for housing she asked why the City is settling for 15 units of housing and the City is still contributing funds to this and is enabling this. She stated that the cost is too high on the rest of the planning goals and the surrounding neighborhoods. She urged the owner to come up with a better housing proposal for this site that is next to the park and is family friendly and environmentally sustainable. \n\nCouncillor Mallon spoke about the Pizzuto family, the former owner, who went to the self-storage group because they wanted a low impact, low traffic for this street. She noted that this is a major concern in this area about the traffic in this area. She noted that this began with a low impact traffic goal. She shared the Planning Board concerns about spot zoning, the parcel next door and what happens with this. Councillor Mallon stated that asking JAS to build 100% affordable housing for this site was not feasible based on timing and the finances needed. She stated that suggesting that this could be building under AHO, which has not been passed yet and may not happen. She commented that the land value is significant, and JAS has come before the City Council many times informing the City Council about how they were unable to bid on property because of the land price and the cost of building housing. This offers an opportunity to build affordable housing quickly. She stated that keeping Evolve, 15 units of affordable housing and low impact traffic on a s street which is being built up with residential housing and having commercial and residential on the same site that will keep the traffic low makes this project appealing. She expressed her gratitude to the petitioners for their work to make this project supportable. She stated that she is struggling with this. She asked Mr. Nicholson if it is possible under the AHO could this be 100% affordable housing in the future.\n\nMr. Nicholson stated that there could be a mechanism where that site becomes all housing but whether it would be all affordable housing or mixed income housing similar to the HRI project on Concord Avenue is hard to say at this point. He stated that the numbers were run 1.5 years ago, and they have not been run under the potential of the overlay zoning. He stated that this is an expensive project. It would involve 9% and 4% tax credits as well as a significant subsidy from the state and the City. He explained that 9% credits are very competitive and may take 2-3 years for this to be approved. He added that the process of entitling it under 40B involves a potential for various appeals and lawsuits associated with this because it would not be a by-right type of building in terms of parking ratio and setbacks looking to maximize the space. These are the difficult things that JAS does all the time, but it is not quick, and he cannot guarantee this, and it is not simple. This site can be all housing but will likely not be all affordable housing. \n\nCouncillor Mallon noted that there would have to be 75 units to get the amount needed for the incentive zoning. Vice Mayor Devereux stated that the HRI project on Concord Avenue it was stated that it was 98 units of affordable housing. Mr. Nicholson stated that there is mid-market component and there is a market rate component. He stated that there is a middle market that is outside of the standard structure and he thought that there was a market rate component. He explained how the 9% tax credits work. He stated that there is a sweet spot at about 45 units. Once above this the 9% tax credits are maxed out that can be applied to the building. Then you start with the 4% tax credit tier and this is about 3.25% and this is one-third of all the tax credits beyond this which means that this requires more subsidy. He explained that this is offset by having higher rents that the tax credits allow. Councillor Carlone added of the 98 units, 10 units are middle-income units. Councillor Mallon stated that the CDD\u2019s website states it is 98 units and all units will be affordable.\n\nCouncillor Siddiqui asked what is the public purpose to provide this type of use that has not been recognized. The petition has changed since June 4th and it does not feel as well thought out as it should or could be. She stated that to negotiate this way is difficult. \n\nCouncillor Carlone announced that the petitioners would like this to be moved forward because of a purchase and sale agreement.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that understanding the value of the affordable housing investment by petitioner is key. He noted that having access to land is a good thing. He stated that he would rather the gym space be a Pre-Kindergarten space, which is sorely lacking in Cambridge. He wanted this to be a true public benefit and understand the value of affordable housing investment. The impact of the project has been minimized by the design of project and the programming. He agreed that there are issues with the path, but the path was what Envision put on the site knowing that the methane was on this site. He stated that taking out the path will add more green. He stated that architecturally there are things that could minimize the massing. The set back on the roof with the top floor instead of being vertical could be treated like a roof on an angle so that the bulk plane is actually a metal roof instead of a metal facade which would make the appearance feel less overwhelming. He stated that most people would experience this from the soccer field which would reduce the overall building to about 30 feet. He commented that the solution from the street is good. The value of affordable housing investment has to be known for him to fully understand. He applauded the effort on the petition by the petitioners.\n\nMr. Nicholson spoke about the value of affordable housing. The land price is in the area of $50,000 per unit; this is a significant discount. He spoke about how the construction costs would be dealt with. He noted that the foundation, parking, and the podium that\u2019s the housing will be sitting on will be done by developer and there remove those costs. Only the stick-built component of the actual unit is what JAS would be buying. He stated that this is $2.5-$3 million of benefit and reduced cost for the affordable housing. He spoke about not having to do site work, podium, steel construction on this level is a significant discount on a per square foot price from overall construction. Councillor Carlone stated that this information needs to be formalized. \n\nCouncillor Kelley stated that he would feel better if someone with more knowledge about housing construction and affordable housing policy come to the City Council and state that this is a good deal. He commented that the proponents are good people and are proposing to do something that will be a big deal for them and it may be a great deal for the City of Cambridge. He stated that if we are going to do this we should be up front about the fact that whatever is done is a negotiating process. He stated that the zoning should not stay as it was written decades ago especially in a world that is evolving fast. He resents making judgments based on the money being saved per unit given the cost of the site and adding to this confusion about the placement of the path and the use of the path is troubling. He stated that this is not a comfortable discussion for him.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan stated that he is uncomfortable to negotiate with so little information. He suggested moving this forward without a recommendation and this will be before the City Council at the July 29th meeting and it will give petitioners time to address the concerns of the Ordinance Committee and provide information requested. This provides the City Council with the opportunity to fully weigh the cost and benefits of this project. He commented that as difficult it is for his colleagues to say yes to this project; it would also be difficult to say no to 15 units of affordable housing (20,000 square feet of affordable housing) because they are family units. He added that it is difficult for him to say to the first truly Net Zero project in Cambridge. He stated that he would like to see the whole site be affordable housing but short of the City Council rezoning this it cannot be guaranteed. \n\nVice Mayor Devereux stated that the City Council is perfectly willing to rezone for developers and cannot see why not rezone for the City. She stated that with the current FAR at 1.25 there could be 55,000 square feet of storage would be allowed on this size lot and with this petition it is being doubled at 110,000 square feet. She felt that there could be more housing. She commented that 20,000 square feet is a small amount of the total square footage. She stated that they are getting a bonus. She stated that she does not know what commercially viable is as stated in the petition. The City Council is up-zoning something without enough information. She asked the Clerk to outline the procedural aspect of the petition in relation to the summer meeting. In response to the question by Vice Mayor Devereux, Ms. Lopez stated that the Committee Report would be on the agenda for the July 29th City Council Meeting. She stated that the decision of what to do with this petition is up to the City Council. This could be passed to a second reading at the July 29th meeting and then there is time from the July 29th meeting to September 24 to further negotiate or discuss more with the petitioner before ordination. \n\nCouncillor Kelley spoke about a zoning petition to up zone the quadrangle and there will be benefits associated with this and there may be benefits associated with other zoning proposal as well. He stated that this is the way that business is done but he would like to know that the City Council is confident if this gets passed that the hardest and best bargain has been received on behalf of the City. \n\nAttorney Rafferty stated that the petitioners are willing to provide the information requested by the City Council and to work further on the MOU with JAS. He stated that the calendar reality is that if the petition does not leave the Ordinance Committee in time for the opportunity to be on the July 29th agenda the petition would run out of time to do the substantive work. He stated that hearing the concerns expressed, particularly on the path, the petitioners will go back to CDD to discuss the benefits of the path. Other than the width there may be other short comings with the path that will make it not viable. He noted that there is time between now and the July 29th meeting and between the July 29th meeting and the expiration date of the petition. He noted that if this is not referred to City Council for July 29th Special City Council meeting there will be no time for further discussion about this opportunity. He stated that the one consensus he is hearing from the City Council is that this does represent an opportunity and if this is an opportunity worth exploring the petitioners would welcome the chance to continue to work with the staff to provide the details needed to get the City Council in a position of knowledge, particularly on the cost of construction. He stated that with the presence of JAS there is experience with building housing. He stated that there is credibility and a track record that can be built upon with providing the City Council with additional information.\n\nCouncillor Kelley moved to refer the petition to the full City Council without a recommendation.  The motion carried on a voice vote six members. Vice Mayor Devereux was recorded in negative.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that information is being requested to further understand the value that is being generated that JAS or another non-profit will be able to count on. He requested more understanding on architecture and quality of finishes so that it is a positive addition to the street. Vice Mayor Devereux regarding the renderings wanted to see views not from above but from all side and there will be blank walls that are facing Bay State Road. Councillor Carlone commented that if this use is going to be it has to be a positive on all sides. \n\nVice Mayor Devereux noted that the Planning Board mentioned that the language in the petition was unclear. She made the following motion:\n\nORDERED: That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to instruct the  Community Development Department to revise the language in the  New Street Overlay petition and to include in the revision the  following changes:\n\n20.95.1 (1) by striking out 8,000 and inserting 20,000 square feet; \n\n20.94.1 and 20.96.1 entitled Maximum Height be amended by adding  at the end the words \u201cprovided, however that no building shall exceed  55 feet without complying with a 45-degree bulk plain.\u201d\n\nThe question now came on the motion and the motion carried on a voice vote of seven members.\n\nThe following communication was received and made part of the report.\n\nRobin Bonner, 15 Corporal Burns Road, urging the Ordinance Committee not to approve the petition (ATTACHMENT C).\n\nCouncillor Carlone and Councillor Kelley thanked all those present for their attendance.\n\nThe hearing adjourned at 5:46 PM.\n\nFor the Committee,\n\n__________________________________\n\nCouncillor Dennis J.

Carlone, Co-Chair Councillor Craig Kelley, Co-ChairVice Mayor Jan DevereuxCouncillor Alana Mallon Mayor Marc C. McGovernCouncillor Sumbul Siddiqui Councillor Timothy J. Toomey, Jr. Councillor E. Denise SimmonsCouncillor Quinton Zondervan|   \n---|---  \n  \nRECONVENED ORDINANCE HEARING FROM AUGUST 13, 2019 ON THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING OVERLAY DISTRICT\n\nOn September 3, 2019 Councillor Carlone reconvened the Ordinance Committee hearing from August 13, 2019 at 12:06 PM in the Sullivan Chamber to continue discussions on proposed amendments to the Affordable Housing Overlay District petition. He announced that there will be no public comment. He announced that the hearing was being televised.\n\nPresent were: Councillor Carlone, Vice Mayor Devereux, Councillor Mallon, Councillor\n\nSimmons, Councillor Siddiqui, Mayor McGovern, Councillor Kelley, Councillor Zondervan,\n\nCouncillor Toomey, Erik Thorkildsen, Urban Designer, CDD, City Solicitor Nancy Glowa, Chris\n\nCotter, Director of Housing, CDD, Jeff Roberts, Senior Manager of Zoning and Development,\n\nCDD, Cassie Arnaud, Housing Planning, CDD, City Clerk Anthony Wilson, Will Durbin, Chief of\n\nStaff for Mayor McGovern and Donna P. Lopez, City Clerk\u2019s Office.\n\nAlso present were Elaine DeRosa, 4 Pleasant Place, Marilee Meyer, 10 Dana Street, Skip Schloming, 102R Inman Street, Young Kim, 17 Norris Street, James Zall, 203 Pemberton Street, Elizabeth Gombosi, 42 Irving street, Fritz Donovan, 42 Irving Street, Carol O\u2019Hare, 172 Magazine Street, Lynn Cetnito, 46 Grozier Road, Douglass Payne, 24 Sherman Street and John Pitkin 18 Fayette Street.\n\nCouncillor Carlone outlined the format of the meeting. He noted that the City is the petitioner and there are handouts distributed by Community Development Department including an Affordable Housing Zoning proposal, comparison charts dated August 29, 2019 (ATTACHMENT 46), a memo from Community Development dated August 29, 2019, additions to the Affordable Housing Overlay petition are highlighted in blue and Design Guidelines for 100% Affordable Housing Overlay Draft dated August 29, 2019. He stated that is also a handout compiled by the Mayor\u2019s Office as of September 3, 2019 with the amendments to the Affordable Housing Overlay and this will be used as a guide (ATTACHMENT 47). There is also a handout that outlines which amendments are on hold, pending language from City Solicitor and the items that were referred to Community Development Department (ATTACHMENT 48).\n\nMr. Roberts gave an overview of the material submitted to the Ordinance Committee by e-mail last Thursday. The main document is a revised version of the zoning text (ATTACHMENT 49). There were changes to the proposal that were voted on by the Ordinance Committee and they have been incorporated into the zoning text and made some clarifying changes based on comments by the Planning Board that needed clarification. He spoke about clarifying edits which have also been incorporated into the revised text and includes commentary on the right side to be able to identify the substantive changes. He stated that there is a memo on CDD letter head transmitting supplemental information on questions that were asked at the previous Ordinance Committee hearings (ATTACHMENT 50). This memo includes commentary information relating to Net Zero Ready Buildings, Displacement/Relocation Assistance, Transportation Demand Management Requirements, Density Limits/FAR Caps, Applicability and Import of the Tree Ordinance and Historic Preservation and greater clarification about language in the zoning related to the State Register of Historic Places. He stated that another document was an updated comparison charts and maps that illustrate the provision of the Affordable Housing Overlay compared to the base zoning limitations across the base zoning districts in the zoning ordinance (ATTACHMENT 51). He noted that this was presented with the original proposal and this has been updated based on the recent set of changes voted by the Ordinance Committee. He stated that there is an updated set of Design Guidelines incorporating comments made by the Ordinance Committee (ATTACHMENT 52). Mr. Thorkildsen will provide a summary of the changes. \n\nCouncillor Carlone asked if the key points be reviewed by the staff in the presentation. Mr. Roberts stated that he will go through the substantive changes to the zoning text. Councillor Carlone noted that the FAR is different. Mr. Roberts stated that in response to a change to FAR staff looked at. He stated that there was a report that went to the City Council that was prepared with assistance from the Assessing Department. The basis for AHO proposal is the notation for site to be acquired and for the ability to do affordable housing developments in a way where sites could be feasible acquired and develop would require greater density in order to spread the acquisition costs for sites over a greater number of units. The conclusion depending on the site and acquisition costs of site there could a lot of variation but as an approximate mid-point in lower density residential districts an affordable housing project would need to have a FAR of 2 in order to come up with a feasible acquisition per unit. He stated that a FAR of 2 was seen in those districts as a reasonable limitation that would allow affordable housing developments to be feasible on sites in the lower density areas. He stated that as the analysis that was done shows that there are some sites that this would not be feasible and some it would be depending on the character and nature of the site. This was seen to be a reasonable limitation on density.\n\nMr. Cotter stated that there were several amendments that introduced the idea of FAR and the City Council asked CDD staff to review this and come back with comments as to what would be an appropriate FAR. He stated that building from the analysis recently done with the Assessors and the market to see what level of density might be needed in order to make more sites possible for affordable housing development. He stated that he feels comfortable with the FAR of 2.0 even before discussing the form-based approach that was discussed is deriving from a FAR of 2.0. He stated that with the interest in having a cap on density in the neighbor districts this was taken as a good reason to bring up the 2.0 again. This has been put into the petition and was noted in the memo. Councillor Carlone commented that the non-applicable on the higher density zones means that there is no change in the high-density zones. Mr. Cotter responded in the affirmative and stated that there is no cap on FAR that would apply in the neighborhood districts where the FAR is under 1 there would be a cap set at 2. There is no theorical cap in the corridors or the areas expected to see development, but there is a cap based on the size of the building envisioned based on the number of stories and height. Councillor Carlone asked if the lower density districts being affected and was there any studies done on A2, B, C and C1. Mr. Roberts stated that site study models were previously presented; there were several site development alternatives that modeled a building outcome that would be at a FAR of 2. He explained that when the models were done, they were not shown in specific locations. It was decided that it was preferable to show more generic context rather than picking specific sites. The examples are shown in a context with a range of different buildings that may be typical in Res. A, B, or C or lower density districts. There were 2 alternatives shown. One alternative had more units and less parking with a FAR of 2.4. This would exceed the limitation. The second alternative, referred to as Site 3 Alternative B, shows parking on the site with a FAR of 2. Councillor Carlone asked that the alternatives be resubmitted and reworded and that it be based on the submission of today.\n\nMr. Thorkildsen provided a summary of the changes to the Design Guidelines. The change is in the way that the Guidelines are presented, and the language was simplified. The introduction was revised. The text was cleaned up and included principals and objectives and included Historical Guidelines and included illustrations. Councillor Carlone commented that these are still suggestions. Mr. Thorkildsen stated that these are recommended guidelines and not directives.\n\nCity Solicitor Glowa commented on the definitions of abutters and public way. Ms. Glowa stated that the abutter language is included in the revised text. She stated that on page 23 language has been incorporated from the zoning ordinance and Chapter 40A regarding notice and to whom notice is sent. She stated that she is unclear on what she was to provide committee and welcomes further guidance to provide the information. She stated that received a document that refers to 36A amendment and does not appear to be related to public ways. Councillor Carlone noted that there was some concern about how the public way is defined. He noted that there is an amendment to 36A which adds \u201cand the public way.\u201d City Clerk Wilson referred to section 7.6 in the ordinance there are four subsections and there is a proposal to amend subsection (d) that reads New outdoor light fixtures installed in an AHO project shall be fully shielded and directed to prevent light trespass onto adjacent residential lots and the public way. He noted that a question at the last Ordinance Committee hearing was how to appropriately define public way. Councillor Carlone stated that there was not a definitive definition on public way and informed the City Solicitor that she could get back to the Ordinance Committee on this. City Solicitor Glowa stated that it is unclear what guidance is sought. She stated that there is some light on public ways, and it is not clear whether the committee is looking for language that would keep all light from being shed onto any public way. She stated that she could provide suggested language at the next meeting. Vice Mayor Devereux stated that in the revised Design Guidelines there is now a reference to following some of the suggestion in the Outdoor Lighting Ordinance which was never adopted. She stated that the example that she used was the light at the Tobin School that was not shielded and was intended to be a security light for the school which went well beyond the school grounds and blinded pedestrians who were passing. This was a precaution to acknowledge that lighting that is on a property can spill out into the public way and not be pleasant to pedestrians and not provide security. She did not know how to put this into zoning language. City Solicitor Glowa wanted to figure out how best to address this issue. Councillor Carlone stated that this maybe shielded from the public but letting some indirect light go forward. This is about is glare that the Vice Mayor is referring to. City Solicitor Glowa stated that there is a difference between being shielded and not shedding any light. She stated that there are other places in the zoning ordinance that talks about shielding from direct light trespass onto neighboring properties. She stated that she would work on a proposal that is more refined to get to what the committee is getting at. \n\nCouncillor Carlone proceeded to the amendments that were placed on hold. \n\nAmendment # 1. Councillor Carlone moved to modify his amendment to remove striking out the word \u201climited.\u201d He stated the question is, is 4 times the increase in zoning worthy of the word limited being removed. Vice Mayor Devereux stated that the word limited in this sentence refers to height. This is limited increases in height. She noted that a previous amendment she offered was to add the word incremental. She noted that the increases in height are somewhat limited. On an affirmative vote of 9 members the amendment carried.  City Solicitor noted that the word \u201cincremental\u201d was adopted by the Ordinance Committee on August 8th. Councillor Carlone noted that the word \u201cincremental\u201d was approved on Amendment # 5. Councillor Carlone Councillor Carlone moved to modify his amendment to add after the word \u201callow\u201d the word \u201cincremental\u201d and leave in the word limited. On an affirmative vote of 9 members the amendment carried. \n\nAmendment # 2. Councillor Carlone noted that this was an amendment by Councillor Zondervan to include in the Affordable Housing Overlay Eligible Households by adding at the end the words \u201cor a household that was living in a building that is built or refurbished under the AHO.\u201d\n\nCouncillor Simmons stated that she finds this restrictive and will not support it. She noted that this throws off the AMI configurations. She stated that this is more troublesome and requested that it be removed. \n\nVice Mayor Devereux asked Councillor Zondervan if the household that was living in a building that was either rebuilt or refurbished through the AHO met the guidelines for being an AHO tenant is this the intent. Councillor Zondervan responded that this would already be covered by the existing language. The amendment was to address a situation where tenants are above the income limits and are displaced from their home and would not be allowed to return.\n\nCouncillor Simmons spoke about the funding that AHO projects would have. She noted that this is addressed in the memo by CDD. She stated that if an individual is at market rate and moves out and this will bring the tenant back in. She stated that this is not the purpose of the AHO; the AHO is for individuals under a certain percentage of AMI. Mr. Cotter noted that displacement relocation was addressed in the CDD memo. He stated that the goal is not to displace household and work with households to the extent where relocation may be needed whether it is temporary. In the case where households may be eligible for AHO housing that may be created or permitted where a housing provider will work to help someone identify options either within their other affordable housing stock or within the market. This is problematic to have this type of definition in the zoning because it could conflict with requirements of funding sources as well as present logistical issues where a family may need to be moved to create a housing for seniors and to offer them the right to return would be challenging in terms of compatibility if a building is designed for a certain population it may not be appropriate to have tenants move back and they may have been options in a different type of housing. He added that from a policy perspective this is supported and would want to work through this with the housing providers but to have that element of the definition could be challenging from a practical standpoint as to how AHO housing projects would be financed. On a voice vote amendment # 2 failed.\n\nAmendment # 3. Councillor Carlone stated that this is the definition of a Net Zero Ready Building.\n\nCouncillor Carlone read the proposed definition. He stated that affordable housing developments are more efficient than market rate housing because of costs and eliminating long-term heating and cooling costs. He stated that this definition connects with a later amendment on making buildings meet this standard. He favors doing as much as possible to be efficient.\n\nMr. Cotter this was addressed in the memo and recommended in the memo requiring a narrative for affordable housing projects to show a path to net zero at some point in the future recognizing that getting to net zero at this point can be prohibitively expensive and could undermine efforts to create affordable housing if this requirement were set. He stated that affordable housing is seen as performing better and advancing sustainability for using renewables and making the efforts to create housing that will be better for residents, the community and to operate over time. This is challenging to have this requirement if this were to be a prescriptive requirement. He stated that this definition is challenging as it refers to maximizing without setting standards. He stated that if there were such a definition it was recommended that there are clear standards so that an affordable housing provider would know what the baseline is to meet that definition. He noted that the goal and intention is appreciated but recommends approaching this in a different way. Councillor Carlone stated that the recommendation is to treat this as part of the overall Net Zero Action Plan as far as phasing and not penalize prospective affordable housing. Mr. Cotter stated that the intent in this concept for the AHO petition which was to look at affordable housing providers and not require anything more of them than is now required in the market but trying to give them the advantages to better compete in the market recognizing that the challenges to do that now.\n\nCouncillor Simmons suggested striking out this language based on the recommendations from CDD. She acknowledged that the affordable housing developers built to the highest efficient standards. She noted that this encumbers that process. \n\nCouncillor Zondervan stated that the City cannot allow emissions to increase and causing climate change to continue to worsen and causing death. In 2013 a petition was filed that asked the City to increase energy efficiency requirements and to require new construction be net zero and nothing has been done to date. The City builds net zero with the King Open School Complex and leads by example and cannot ask affordable housing developers to build net zero. He stated that this is not prohibitively expensive, and it is inappropriate to use this term. He added that there is a health and safety issue as well where burning gas in buildings pollutes the indoor air and is unhealthy for the occupants. This does not maximize energy efficiency and are burdening the tenants with unnecessary high utility bills. He stated that from a climate change perspective for the City to say that it needs to continue to build buildings that continue to add to emissions, continue to make climate change worse and continue to kill people is not acceptable to him. Councillor Carlone stated that in the Net Zero Plan what are the projected dates for housing to be Net Zero. Councillor Zondervan responded it is 2022 for small residential construction and 2025 for large residential and commercial buildings. He added that many of the affordable housing projects would not fall under the Net Zero requirements until 2025. \n\nVice Mayor Devereux spoke about the CDD memo and asked why there would be a different way to do this through a net zero narrative and if adopted this requirement would apply to affordable housing projects subject to Green Building Requirements, generally projects of 25,000 square feet or more. When will the Green Building Requirements be adopted? She stated that a project of 25,000 square feet is a 25-unit building. She stated that it is not clear to her how many smaller AHO projects there will be and asked if there will be AHO projects that will be less than 25,000 square feet. Mr. Cotter spoke about the types of affordable housing this would affect. He stated that it is expected to see a range of project types and a way to think about this is the number of units and more units are expected in larger buildings along the corridors. One of the goals of the petition is to create opportunities in areas of the City where there is no affordable housing. He spoke about the types of projects expected with a cap of 2.0 is expected to be on smaller sites in the City. He stated that goal to create sustainable buildings is shared and is in the housing priorities. He stated that this is to create affordable housing and the more that the affordable housing providers are asked to do other things the more the intent is undermined. When this was reviewed with the housing providers the reaction was that it would be more challenging to meet the requirement. He stated that if the zoning has this type of requirement of a narrative for buildings that are 25,000 square feet it would become a fundamental eligibility criterion for the AHO.\n\nMr. Roberts addressed the question about the updates to Green Building Requirement. He stated that they are currently being worked on and will be forwarded to the City Council shortly. This is complex and the roll out of the NZAP. He stated that part of the complexity is that it does not fall entirely within the realm of zoning. This needs to work with the energy code requirements which are not regulated by zoning. He stated that finding the right way to balance zoning along with other standards and requirements and figuring out what can and cannot be regulated is part of the challenge. He stated the roll out complexity of the standards will be worked on by various departments.\n\nCouncillor Kelley appreciates the sentiment and the language that the City is continuing to build buildings that are killing people is super extreme and not super helpful. He stated that the City has passed a plan but is still waiting on a variety of ordinance suggestions to include things like modifying the zoning to allow for different types of insulation that would otherwise bring the building into non-compliance. He noted that there are no zoning requirements that push to Net Zero, there is a plan. Mr. Roberts stated that the AHO zoning proposal refers to the Green Building requirements. He stated that as part of the NZAP there are changes to Green Building Requirements that track the recommendations of the NZAP and includes moving from a baseline standard from LEED Silver to LEED Gold. There are other association improvements. She stated that there are other changes coming with this package, such as flexibility in some zoning standards that are meant to enable adding insulation to an existing building which may be non-conforming and may encounter issues with zoning if trying to add insulation to the exterior of a building. He stated that in the AHO included some flexibility in the zoning that would enable these types of improvements. He stated that there are increases in requirements that need to be met but there are also changes meant to create more flexibility in the zoning that would enable improvements that might otherwise not be able to be made. Councillor Kelley stated that he is confused about what is required at this point and the down the line requirements for creating this plan. He is under the impression that it is being done but not part of the zoning yet. He stated that this proposed amendment seems to leapfrog over current City efforts to change the zoning and other rules to bring people into Net Zero. He added at some point the current efforts will come to the City Council in the form of similar zoning changes. Mr. Roberts responded in the affirmative and further stated that the approach with this proposal as initially conceived is for projects being built under the AHO to continue to track the same environmental standards that would apply to comparable residential developments and as they change in the future then affordable housing projects over this AHO as well as all other residential projects would be subject to the same uniform set of standards.\n\nCouncillor Mallon stated that there are extensive efforts that are being put into place, and this does leapfrog. She spoke about the memo from CDD regarding requiring AHO projects to build to Net Zero standards sooner than otherwise required for all development would put affordable housing builders at a disadvantage relative to the developers of market rate housing. She stated that it is important not see any more stunting of affordable housing and does not want this to stop affordable housing from being built. She stated that she will not support this because of leapfrogging.\n\nAt this time Councillor Carlone called for the vote on amendment # 3. On this motion the roll was called and resulted as follows:\n\nYEAS: Councillor Carlone, Vice Mayor Devereux, Councillor Kelley and Councillor \n\nZondervan \\- 4\n\nNAYS: Councillor Mallon, Councillor Siddiqui, Councillor Simmons, Councillor Toomey and Mayor McGovern \\- 5\n\nABSENT: None \\- 0\n\nand amendment # 3 \u2013\n\nFailed.\n\nAmendment # 4. Councillor Carlone moved to remove this amendment to add a definition for Permeable Parking. On an affirmative vote of 9 member the amendment was adopted.\n\nAmendment # 7. Councillor Carlone amendment was to add after Section 4.35. the words \u201cAll such ground floor uses shall\u201d. He stated that in the revised text on page 5 contains language. He stated that his amendment was services shall be provided to the general public. \n\nCouncillor Mallon stated that in her notes from August 8th she has that this amendment would be discussed with amendment # 32 which was around retail space and whether it could be a use that was non-retail but active related to abutters. Councillor Carlone noted that this is what the zoning specificity calls out. This is active uses. She stated that on page 19 of the revised text in (e) it appears that CDD took the spirit and intention of #7 and #32 and put them together in (e). Councillor Carlone noted that question is the word \u201cmay\u201d or \u201cshall.\u201d\n\nMr. Roberts spoke about section 11.207.4 entitle \u201cUse.\u201d This sets forth what uses are allowed. It is important to establish clearly what uses are allowed. He explained that the AHO only applies to residential uses but there is an exception in an affordable housing overlay project can have some non-residential uses at the ground floor and it is important to clarify what those uses are. In the revised text the reason for the addition is has to do with section 4.34 includes both office and lab uses and there was a question if this meant to include labs and that it would be helpful to clarify that it is only office. This is the reason for the text Paragraphs a. through e. This just states what uses are allowed and this is the intent. He stated that if the City wants to be expansive and encourage active ground floor use it is helpful to be as expansive as is reasonable so that there are different options for what that space can be used for. Councillor Carlone noted that some districts require active ground floor, but this would negate that. Mr. Roberts stated that this section of the zoning is meant to establish that in any zone in districts that allows non-residential uses and could be districts that allow institutional uses, such as community centers, libraries or social services and could include business districts that allow retail use or office districts that allow office uses that in those districts if an affordable housing development is being built under the AHO it can have one of these allowed uses at the ground floor. He stated that this zoning can be utilized for a project that is all affordable housing plus one of these listed non-residential uses that are otherwise allowed in the base zoning at the ground floor. This is not restrictive.\n\nCouncillor Kelley is confused about stories at ground, above and below grade which is found on page 18 of the revised text in paragraph (f) and what is allowed at ground stories. Councillor Carlone stated that this will be addressed later. \n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that based on the explanation of Mr. Roberts he moved to remove his amendment. On an affirmative vote of 9 members the amendment was removed.\n\nAmendment # 8. Councillor Carlone stated that this is an amendment submitted by Councillor Zondervan to insert in Section 4 Use a new (b) (i).\n\nCouncillor Zondervan stated that the idea is to protect existing retail or other services being provided on ground floor in a building that is potentially being redeveloped under the AHO. He stated that the motivation behind this is that there are a lot of single-story buildings along the transit corridors that should have housing on the top. This overlay attempts to create these incentives that will allow this to happen. He stated that without protection for these existing businesses or small business this would make it less likely that those sites would get developed. He spoke about Mayor McGovern\u2019s concern about formula businesses but those can and often are owned by local small business owners who are operating a franchise under a formula business brand. He stated that this underscores the tension and the challenge with this approach because the City is trying to achieve many of the goals at the same time and cannot simply prioritize one goal at the expense of others. He stated that there needs to be some way to protect these existing buildings and using this protection as a way to unlock those development opportunities so that both goals of producing more affordable housing and promoting small local businesses and maintaining vitality on the street. Councillor Carlone stated that he agreed but the amendment is very specific in a rental amount of 5% of the annual gross income. Councillor Zondervan commented that he meant to state no greater than 5%. He stated that this was provided as the right amount to limit so that the business would be able to operate in that space. He spoke about the vacant storefront across the City because of the high rents and further stated that it is important to put a limit on the rent so that these businesses are not being displaced.\n\nMayor McGovern stated that he is opposed to this because affordable housing developer would have to relocate a major business and does not want to do this on the back of affordable housing developers; this is not required of for-profit developers. He is open to any amendment that does not undermine the financial viability of affordable housing. This would be impossible for an affordable housing developer to do. He stated that the City needs to look at how to better support, particularly small businesses but putting this on the backs of affordable housing developers is not right.\n\nCouncillor Siddiqui agreed with the Mayor. She stated that legally this is not tenable. This amendment is unreasonably impractical. There is one goal from the beginning which is to figure out how to make affordable housing more cost effective and this gets in the way of this goal. She commented that the City is trying to figure out what can be done to help the City\u2019s retailers. This does not make sense. \n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that this is an important issue and it needs to be resolved.\n\nCouncillor Simmons understands the idea behind the amendment but it is putting a burden on something that we are trying to correct through an economic development perspective on the AHO. She added that the AHO is not the place for a cure all. This is prohibitive. She stated that the community-based builders have stated that because of so many restrictions and financial burdens it is hard to build affordable housing. She stated that this amendment may be well-intended it is a putting a strain on building affordable housing and making it prohibitive. She requested Councillor Zondervan to withdraw his amendment or she would have to vote against it.\n\nCouncillor Kelley asked when a Special Permit is issued outside of the Massachusetts Avenue Overlay District it requires some amount of retail at the ground floor could the Planning Board require absent the base zoning that there be retail set aside for a project. City Solicitor Glowa responded that the only way that the Planning Board can impose such a requirement is if it exists somewhere within the ordinance provisions that relate to that Special Permit. Councillor Kelley spoke about Huron Village which does not have a ground floor retail requirement and if an individual purchased property today and developed it per the zoning ordinance they would not be required, and the Planning Board could not require them to put in ground floor retail. Mr. Roberts stated that if zoning does not require it, it cannot be specifically required. The Planning Board as part of a more holistic project review takes into account the character of the area, what the planning for the area dictates and the desirable outcome. He stated that there are instances where the Planning Board reviews a project for the first time and comments that the project would be approved if there were retail at some place in the project on the ground floor and this is something that evolves through project review. He stated that in the context of this proposal it would not be appropriate for the Planning Board to require a particular retailer be brought back or put provisions in place regarding the commercial rents that could be charged. Councillor Kelley stated that the lack of a Special Permit process which is proposed for a variety of reasons and this changes the discussion for whatever projects might come. He stated that if the AHO gets passed the rules change dramatically and it is difficult to compare the new rules with current rules. He stated that there is some ability for the Planning Board to push a project to have ground floor retail where the underlining zoning does not require it but is not codified and cannot push overly hard. Mr. Roberts stated that much that is in the AHO proposal does acknowledge that in many areas of the City projects do not require review by the Planning Board. But the acknowledgement of the AHO is meant to create a permitting path that would not require a Special Permit or Variance where they may otherwise might be required. He noted that the AHO does impose specific requirements. He noted that the committee was currently discussing an amendment on relocation and rent for existing retailers. He stated that elsewhere in the AHO there is a requirement that in certain business districts where retail uses are allowed if there is an existing retail use then the AHO must produce an active ground floor space that was intended to continue and support the street front character of the area. \n\nMayor McGovern stated that it would be helpful to stick with the amendment that is in front of the committee. He announced that these changes only apply under a very strict set of rules. This is not about all development or all zoning. He stated that if a 100% affordable housing development is not being built the extra height and the streamline permitting process does not apply. It is important to note that under very specific projects only do these changes apply. This is for a 100% affordable housing projects only. \n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that one of the prime areas for redevelopment is one-story retail districts and will have an impact with retail that is struggling. \n\nVice Mayor Devereux stated that there is a place mentioned later where it states that if there is existing retail in a business district and refers to the AHO. She asked where this appears in the revised text. Mr. Cotter stated that this on page 18 in the revised text in paragraph (e). The Ordinance Committee amended the text from and to or. These would require an AHO project to include ground floor retail in projects that are built on site that had a former retail site or abut another parcel that has a retail use. Mayor McGovern stated that (e) on page 18 of the revised text is not the amendment being discussed. He added that the amendment before the committee is an amendment submitted by Councillor Zondervan about relocation fees and bringing retail back. \n\nVice Mayor Devereux stated that on August 13th the Ordinance Committee voted on this. She added that it is important to remember that the committee did vote on a provision for maintaining retail. She stated that she understands that the amendment by Councillor Zondervan is different but wanted the committee to have the conversation about relocation also remembering that there was a vote to keep the local retail. She added that clearly there is a great deal of confusion about what this zoning actually states. \n\nCouncillor Zondervan commented that this amendment is being characterized as creating an obstacle to affordable housing development and most of these sites will not be developed if there is not some provision to protect the existing retailer in the building. He stated that by not having this provision this is excluding good sites for affordable housing development and this is to unlock more opportunities for affordable housing and if the associated costs are not paid for them the affordable housing will not be built. He stated that this whole zoning is built on the fact that the City is funding, to a large extent, this affordable housing construction. He stated that if the zoning is only addressed and these other obstacles are not the goals may not be achieved of unlocking more affordable housing opportunities. There is a need for something to protect existing businesses in sites that really should have 2-4 stories of affordable housing above the retail.\n\nCouncillor Simmons stated that she did not agree with this in this context. She commented that the zoning is a living document. She recommended vote the amendments the body can and then come back to the other amendments. She urged Councillor Zondervan to withdraw this amendment or let the Ordinance Committee vote on this.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that this is an important issue and this needs to be solved. There are other communities that builds affordable housing above retail.\n\nThe question now came on the amendment and the roll was called and resulted as follows:\n\nYEAS: Councillor Carlone, Councillor Kelley and Councillor Zondervan \\- 3\n\nNAYS: Councillor Mallon, Councillor Siddiqui, Councillor Simmons, Councillor Toomey and\n\nMayor McGovern \\- 5\n\nABSENT: None \\- 0\n\nPRESENT: Vice Mayor Devereux \\- 1\n\nand amendment # 8 \u2013\n\nFailed.\n\nAmendment #13 and #14. Councillor Carlone stated that this has been modified in the presentation by CDD. It was FAR in any district. \n\nMayor McGovern moved adoption of the recommendations by CDD appearing in the revised text as 11.207.5.2.2 Residential Density sections (a) and (b). \n\nMr. Roberts stated that his understanding from the last hearing is that there were some different amendments proposed that would have set different standards for density limitation and were discussed by the Ordinance Committee. The Ordinance Committee asked CDD to review the matter further and came forth with a suggestion. \n\nCouncillor Zondervan stated that he believed that he also had an amendment in a different location. The amendment was part of Amendment # 36 in subsection (d) as follows: Notwithstanding any other requirements, any building permitted through the AHO shall be limited to a Floor Area Ratio (FAR) of 3.0 or double the base zoning, whichever is less, to ensure sufficient land area for green space to mitigate heat and flooding considerations of climate change. Mayor McGovern stated that there were three amendments that dealt with FAR. \n\nMayor McGovern moved to strike amendment # 13. On an affirmative vote of 9 members the amendment was adopted.\n\nCouncillor Carlone moved to strike amendment # 14. On an affirmative vote of 9 members the amendment was adopted.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux questioned the BA-4 district created on Waldon and Sherman Streets relating to the Masse Development. She stated that it would not be included in 2.0 cap; this is a small district. She asked if this was an oversight by CDD not to because it allows height taller than the Masse Building which is under 45 feet.\n\nMr. Robert stated that the overarching principal here is to apply the same variations in height and density for affordable housing development under overlay within districts that are roughly comparable to each other. The BA-4 district was modified to allow a specific development on a specific site, in terms of the overall density and height limitations it is comparable to a Business A or a Business A-2 district. He stated that adjustments were made to make the height lower and density higher but in most respects the density and height are very comparable to Business A. He stated that under this AHO we wanted to treat those districts in roughly comparable ways. Across all these districts, under the most recent height amendment adopted by the Ordinance Committee where it currently allows 44-45 feet the AHO would allow six story buildings. Vice Mayor Devereux stated that she does not think this should be because the Sherman Street district was created specifically to be financially feasible for this development to put parking underground. This density was increased; the height was not increased. She stated that putting a 6-7 story building on Walden Street near Sherman Street is not the outcome wanted. This makes it equivalent to what is allowed on North Massachusetts Avenue in a BA-2 district. This district cannot support a 60-70-foot high building with an unlimited FAR. Councillor Carlone comment that this is an unusual district in that there is very little business in this location. Vice Mayor Devereux does not think that the BA-4 district extends across Walden Street to include Paddy\u2019s. She stated that the zoning for this section should be looked at more closely to see what the City wants to see there. Councillor Kelley asked if Vice Mayor Devereux was submitting amendment of not. Vice Mayor Devereux stated that this came up because she was looking at where the 2.0 FAR does not apply and prompted her to look at why it does not apply and it is because the cut off for capping at 2.0 was to say which ones under the current zoning have a 1.0 FAR or less and because this one was up zoned to help the developer to create to 27 units of housing on the corner lot it was up zoned to 1.75 or 2.0 FAR if it has ground floor retail. This was zoning to enable one project. \n\nVice Mayor Devereux made the following motion:\n\nORDERED: That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to instruct the Community Development Department to review both the density and height under the AHO for the BA-4 district and make a recommendation to the Ordinance Committee. \n\nThe motion was adopted on an affirmative vote of 8 members. Councillor Simmons was recorded\n\nas present.\n\nMayor McGovern stated that he had previously made a motion to accept the recommendation of CDD for 2.0 and suggested voting on this amendment together with the amendment offered by Councillor Zondervan. \n\nThe recommendation by CDD was in the revised text in section 11.207.5.2.2 Residential Density in subsection (a). \n\nCouncillor Carlone questioned that the only place the AHO will work is in areas with a FAR of less than 1.00. Mr. Roberts stated that the proposal is to establish a limit on the FAR in districts where the current district standards would limit it to 1.0 or less. In other districts there would be no maximum FAR. This would be as originally proposed where the development density would be limited by the overall height and the other dimensional controls that are in place and there would not be a numerical limit on FAR. \n\nCouncillor Zondervan stated that the comparison chart has a table that shows each district FAR and the proposed limit. He stated that his understanding of the language is that it only applies if the FAR is less than 1.0. Mr. Roberts stated that there is no district that is 1.0. \n\nVice Mayor Devereux stated that this is trying to make these projects more financially attainable for affordable developers and the ones in .5 districts have higher land values and is the 2.0 a rough guess and how this will work as land values continue to increase. She noted that no districts are being referenced and only referencing where the FAR is less than 1.0 assuming that the zoning passes and lasts for a decade or two there is a possibility that the base zoning districts could change and asked if the committee wanted a reference to the 1.0 or call out which districts this is about. Councillor Carlone stated that every district should have a FAR and be honest about the FAR.\n\nMayor McGovern moved suspension of the rules in order to bring forward Councillor Zondervan\u2019s amendment #36 (d).\n\nCouncillor Zondervan moved to amend the recommendation by CDD by substitution with the language in 36 (d) for (a) in section 11.207.5.2.2. The question came on the motion to amend by substitution and the roll was called and resulted as follows:\n\nYEAS: Councillor Carlone, Vice Mayor Devereux, Councillor Kelley and Councillor\n\nZondervan \\- 4\n\nNAYS: Councillor Mallon, Councillor Simmons, Councillor Toomey and Mayor\n\nMcGovern \\- 4\n\nABSENT: None \\- 0\n\nPRESENT: Councillor Siddiqui \\- 1\n\nAnd the amendment \u2013\n\nFailed.\n\nMayor McGovern proceeded to move adoption of 11.207.5.2.2 residential density (a). On an affirmative vote of 9 members the amendment was adopted.\n\nMr. Roberts clarified the language in 11.207.5.2.2. (b). He stated that in the original version of the petition there was language to the effect that there would be no limitation FAR or lot area per dwelling unit. He explained because now there is a limit on FAR there was the need to move the sentence. \n\nCouncillor Carlone moved adoption of 11.207.5.2.2 (b). On an affirmative vote of 9 members the amendment was adopted.\n\nAmendment # 23. An amendment by Councillor Zondervan to amend (a) in Section 6 Parking and Bicycle Parking. \n\nCouncillor Zondervan noted that this was referred to CDD to review the language. \n\nMr. Roberts stated that on page 12 of the revised text there is new language suggested to the effect of what the Ordinance Committee voted on. He read the revised text in 11.207.6.1 (a). He stated that the language was cleaner. He stated that language was added to 11.207.6.1 (b). He stated that in zoning the standards only apply to parking spaces or loading bays. There are no specific standards for pick up and drop off and deliveries. It was important to establish that the Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department would have a role in certifying that such facilities are being provided in a way that is reasonably suited to accommodate that activity in a way that would not cause significant hazard or congestion and there would be the ability for Traffic and Parking to promulgate regulations so that overtime there could be clearer standards put into place for what would constitute appropriate pick up, drop off and delivery facilities.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux questioned why there would be either on or off-street deliveries because most of this activity is wanted to be off-street. By removing the obligation to provide actual parking spaces does not mean that there will not be any parking in these projects, but this is a broad thing to say. \n\nMr. Roberts stated that after consultation with Traffic, Parking and Transportation stated that things can vary by scale and by existing conditions and if it is a small site or small number of units the concern is having the ability for a small moving van which is routinely handled by Traffic and Parking by issuing permits to allow for this on a temporary basis. \n\nCouncillor Zondervan moved to amend his amendment by substituting in the language suggested by CDD in 11.207.6.1 (a) and (b). On the motion to amend by substitution on an affirmative vote of 9 members the amendment was adopted. The question now came on adoption of the substituted language in 11.207.6.1 (a) and (b). On an affirmative vote of 9 members the amended language was adopted.\n\nAmendment #23C. An amendment by Vice Mayor Devereux. She stated that this was covered in the memo from CDD on the cost of providing a TPass for a full year. \n\nMr. Roberts stated that there is commentary in the CDD memo under the Transportation Demand Management section but is no change to the zoning text. He spoke about the issue of on-going commitments. \n\nMr. Cotter spoke about the perspective of on-going costs and understanding the impact of offering a TPass subsidy would mean to a project in terms of the subsidy and it was found to be significant. He stated that issue as to whether or not such a subsidy on an on-going basis might be considered as income was reviewed. He stated that under a strict definition of income it would be. He stated that at the bottom of page 4 in the memo offered a recommendation to modify the petition text to change the provision of discounted TPasses for three-month duration in the original petition to increase it to six-months. \n\nVice Mayor Devereux commented that what is in the memo did not migrate to the revised text. She moved to amend section 11.207.6.5 Transportation Demand Management in (a) by striking out three- months and substituting in place six-months. She announced that this only applies to AHO projects that are not providing off-street parking at a ratio of .4 space per dwelling unit or more. \n\nCouncillor Simmons spoke about the impact of the TPass. She asked if the TPass would impact income. Mr. Cotter stated that the definition of income under HUD regulations which are applicable to CHA and other housing providers would likely suggest that providing on-going subsidies for a transit pass would be considered income but do not think that it would rise to be considered income if it were provided on a limited or short-term basis. \n\nVice Mayor Devereux moved to amend 11.207.6.5 Transportation Demand Management in (a) by striking out three-months. On an affirmative vote of 9 members the amendment was adopted.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux moved to amend 11.207.6.5 Transportation Demand Management in (a) by inserting six-months. On an affirmative vote of 9 members the amendment was adopted.\n\nCouncillor Carlone now moved that acceptance of 11.207.6.5 Transportation Demand Management in (a) as amended. On an affirmative vote of 9 members the amendment was adopted.\n\nCouncillor Carlone moved a Recess at 2:56 PM.\n\nOn a motion by Councillor Carlone the hearing reconvened at 3:15 PM.\n\nAmendment # 28. To amend 7.3 Building Fa\u00e7ade. This amendment appears in the revised text in 11.207.7.3 (a) and incorporates the recommendations made by Councillor Carlone on the amount of glass in facades going from 15% to 20 % on building facades facing a public street. He stated that the average affordable housing is 23% and market rate housing is 28-30%. He stated that for buildings located in a Business A, Business A-2, Business B or Business C district this figure shall be increased to 30% from 25%. \n\nCouncillor Carlone moved the amendment to 11.207.7.3 (a) by striking out 15% and inserting 20%. On an affirmative vote of 8 members the amendment was adopted. Councillor Simmons was recorded as present. \n\nCouncillor Carlone moved to amend in the business districts by striking out 25% and inserting in place 30%. \n\nCouncillor Mallon questioned if this was a recommendation by CDD or was this a change made based on the discussion at the Ordinance Committee. Mr. Roberts stated that these were changes voted by the Ordinance Committee. Councillor Carlone stated that these were not voted on by the Ordinance Committee but were referred to CDD. He noted that he had written 30% residential and 70% active use on the first floor. There is no comment on this. \n\nMr. Roberts stated that transparent window standards are in the zoning districts throughout the City to try to promote a street friendly character building. He spoke about the overall there is a variation of the windows across the City. He spoke about historic building having a friendly historic character the percentage of windows may be 20-25% and is compatible with surrounding area and create a decent streetscape. He stated that the more requirements in place the more limiting it is on design. He stated another concern is if buildings are being expected to be meeting strong energy efficiency standards in some cases requiring a large amount of clear windows could work counter to this and may have a negative effect.\n\nMr. Thorkildsen stated that in looking at some example facades there were nice facades with a low percentage of glass but had other architectural details. He stated the question about higher percentage ratio on street facades in Business B etc. districts are a good idea but should check some examples. It is not unreasonable to ask for more. Councillor Carlone asked about retail frontage. Mr. Thorkildsen stated that 70% is a reasonable number.\n\nCouncillor Carlone commented that 15% is low and in older buildings the more there is vertical glass windows per people is a friendlier building. He stated that 70% solid is a lot of solid in any room.\n\nMr. Roberts stated that the revised text on page 18 in section (iii) contained a requirement that the portion containing active non-residential uses would be at least 50% transparent glass and based on the Ordinance Committee amendment language was incorporated stating that if it is retail or consumer service it be 70% along one street in case of a corner lot. The language was put in for greater clarity. Councillor Carlone stated that the 30% should not include the ground floor in the calculation; this should be excluded and separate.\n\nCouncillor Carlone moved adoption of the language in the revised text in 11.207.7.3 (a) by striking out 25% and inserting 30%. On an affirmative vote of 9 members the amendment was adopted.\n\nCouncillor Carlone questioned the clarifying revisions by CDD and asked if they need to be adopted. Mr. Roberts stated that in the revised text there are suggested changes made by CDD. There are also clarifying revisions made by CDD. \n\nCity Solicitor stated that the intent was to strike the language in 11.207.7.3 (c) and in addition to recommend adding this language into the Design Guidelines. She stated that a vote is required to strike out the language. Councillor Carlone asked if this was added to the Guidelines. Mr. Thorkildsen responded in the affirmative.\n\nCouncillor Carlone moved to strike out in 11.207.7.3 (c) and move this to the Guidelines. On an affirmative vote of 9 members this amendment was adopted.\n\nCity Solicitor Glowa, in response to a question by Councillor Carlone, stated that the committee needed to move to substitute the entire document submitted by CDD with its various amendments or to vote each clarifying amendment separately. \n\nCouncillor Carlone moved to substitute and replace existing language with the amended language proposed or distributed by CDD to the entire City Council. No action taken.\n\nMayor McGovern suggested that the committee go through the document with the amendments and vote on these amendments and then act on the revised text by CDD.\n\nAmendment #30. Councillor Carlone noted that CDD was to provide the minimum dimensions for a two-way driveway. \n\nMr. Roberts stated that the width of driveways is regulated in Article 6 of the Zoning Ordinance. He stated that the minimum width each way for a one-way driveway is 10 feet and a two-way driveway would be 20 feet. Councillor Carlone asked if there is a need for a walkway on the side of the driveway. This is contained in the revised text in 11.207.7.4 (b).\n\nMr. Roberts stated that there was discussion at the last Ordinance Committee hearing about the amount of space needed for a driveway or a curb cut and is in the zoning in Article 6, so this does not need to be specified in the zoning. He stated that the maximum in residential districts is 20 feet for residential streets and in other districts the maximum is 30 feet. \n\nCity Solicitor Glowa noted that any contextual change needs to be voted upon by the Ordinance Committee. The multicolored document has been what has been worked on. The language in the revised text does contain additional language changes and if the City Council wishes to consider the additional changes it should be voted upon at this time while discussing this section or if there is interest by the committee to move all the changes in this document it would be a different option. \n\nCouncillor Carlone noted that it could be more specific. He remembers it being principal street on a corner lot. He asked could this be the longer street. \n\nMr. Roberts stated that the one change that was not voted on in this motion. He stated that the request was for CDD to provide the minimum dimension for a two-way driveway. His understanding of the intent of the 75% of the length of the fa\u00e7ade to exclude the driveway access and that is why this additional language is there and would need to be voted on. He stated that his recommendation would be to leave this as it is in the revised text. \n\nCouncillor Carlone moved to accept the language provided by CDD in 11.207.7.4 (b). On an affirmative vote of 9 members the amendment was adopted.\n\nCity Solicitor Glowa informed the City Council that any textual changes will need to be voted on by the committee. will this undue any of the changes previously made. She added that the committee has been going through the multicolored document which listed a number of changes that were either voted upon from the original time that document was made. The revised text, the blue document is the text of the actual petition with the changes that CDD and with the assistance of the Law Department has reviewed and provided the changes that were explicitly voted upon by the committee or changes that were requested by the committee. The staff was working from the actual petition language and this other document is confusing. \n\nCouncillor Simmons asked the City Solicitor if the committee took a vote on the textual changes would this undue or change anything that was not voted on up to this point. \n\nMr. Roberts stated that the only change that the committee has voted on today that is not reflected in the revised text is the change regarding the TPass subsidy from three months to six months. The changes that the Ordinance Committee has voted on were changes that were incorporated into the revised text and other clarifying text changes. \n\nCity Solicitor Glowa there is no question of undoing any votes taken. She stated that if committee wishes to it could move to adopt all of the proposed changes in the revised text and any changes in the multicolor document that were voted upon today that are not in the revised text these changes can be inserted into the revised text so that moving forward there would be one integrated document with changes voted upon.\n\nCouncillor Simmons moved to adopt all the proposed changes in the revised text and any changes in the multicolored document that were voted upon today that are not in the revised text and that they be inserted into the revised text. Councillor Carlone suggested that this motion be made at the end of the amendments.\n\nMayor McGovern noted that there are only a few more amendments to go and when completed CDDs amendment can be moved to be accepted. If this is moved out of committee today, CDD will produce a clean document of the text.\n\nAmendment #36B. Councillor Zondervan stated that B is about the Net Zero Ready which was placed on hold pending Article 22 amendments to be submitted to the City Council in September which has a definition of Net Zero Ready. He added that this can be kept on hold or vote to strike this amendment.\n\nMayor McGovern moved to strike in 7.6 (b). The question now came on the amendment and the roll was called and resulted as follows:\n\nYEAS: Councillor Carlone, Councillor Kelley, Councillor Mallon, Councillor Siddiqui, Councillor Simmons, Councillor Toomey and Mayor McGovern \\- 7\n\nNAYS: Councillor Zondervan \\- 1\n\nABSENT: None \\- 0\n\nPRESENT: Vice Mayor Devereux \\- 1\n\nand the amendment to strike out 36B was -\n\nAdopted.\n\nAmendment #36 (c). Councillor Mallon question that the language in the revised text was what was voted on by the committee.\n\nMr. Roberts stated that in the CDD memo there was a request at the last Ordinance Committee to study the cost implications which are incorporated into a section of the CDD memo on tree protection. The language has been incorporated on page 20 in 11.207.7.6 (c) intended to be cleaner. He stated that it is funny to state in zoning that the zoning states that these requirements apply from another ordinance is the one that might exempt projects under this overlay from being subject. This is what was incorporated into the draft. Councillor Mallon wanted to ensure that the committee was voting on the CDD language rather than what was presented in the multicolored document.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux stated that in the CDD language it states it shall comply with the requirements of such ordinance to the extent that it would be required to comply if not an AHO project. Vice Mayor Devereux asked what other projects do not have to comply with the Tree Ordinance. Mr. Roberts stated that under the zoning ordinance only some projects are required to comply with the provisions of the Tree Protection Ordinance as set forth in the zoning and also in the Tree Protection Ordinance. \n\nCouncillor Simmons commented on the CDD memo on page 5 that states making AHO project subject to the requirements of the Tree Ordinance it will make some cost complications. She noted that the whole idea of the AHO was to make it easier or facilitate the building of affordable housing units. She will vote present because it may complicate the AHO and adds a small obstacle in this process. The intent was to clear or make easier the path and this does not do this.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan suggested amendment the CDD language by striking out AHO and inserting in place affordable housing project because it may make it clearer. \n\nCity Solicitor Glowa stated that the Tree Protection Ordinance does not apply to afford housing projects and this language was intended to make it clear that AHO projects would be exempt from the requirements of the Tree Protection Ordinance. \n\nCouncillor Simmons asked does this make it more difficult for developers under the AHO. \n\nMr. Cotter stated that it does make it more complicated to comply with the Tree Protection Ordinance. He stated that adding any requirement does make things more complicated from the standpoint of a housing development provider. This amendment would eliminate the exemption. \n\nCouncillor Simmons stated that this provides a restriction even though well intended and she would be inclined not to support this amendment. \n\nCouncillor Zondervan moved his amendment to strike out AHO and insert affordable housing project and then substitute the revised text language for his original amendment. On a voice vote of 8 members the amendment was adopted. Councillor Simmons was recorded as present.\n\nThe question now came on the motion to substitute the amended revised text for his amendment to the original petition. On this question the roll was called and resulted as follows:\n\nYEAS: Councillor Carlone, Vice Mayor Devereux, Councillor Kelley, Councillor Mallon, Councillor Siddiqui, Councillor Zondervan and Mayor McGovern \\- 7\n\nNAYS: Councillor Simmons \\- 1\n\nABSENT: None \\- 0\n\nPRESENT: Councillor Toomey \\- 1\n\nand the amendment was \u2013\n\nAdopted.\n\nCouncillor Carlone now moved that the 11.207.7.6 (c) be amended to strike out AHO an insert the words affordable housing project. On an affirmative vote of 9 members the amendment was adopted.\n\nAmendment #36A. Councillor Mallon asked is ISD able to decide based on whether this is fully shielded. \n\nCity Solicitor Glowa stated that shielded may be more appropriate than fully-shielded. She stated that she will look at existing language, confer with the Commissioner of Inspectional Services and report back to the committee at the next meeting.\n\nCouncillor Mallon wanted fully shielded kept. \n\nAmendment #41 Overlay Design Consultation Objectives.\n\nCouncillor Carlone wanted to state the objectives clearly. \n\nCity Solicitor Glowa stated that one of the sensitivities here is the appealability of any. In this case this case the requirement for a Special Permit has been removed but a developer of an AHO project would still need a building permit and building permits are appealable. By having language that is more subjective or qualitative as opposed to quantitative requirements there is the possibility that this could open the City or developer up to having a building permit appealed on the basis that there are some unclear standards here in the zoning ordinance. An opponent of the project could state that they did not meet the requirements. So, the recommendation was to move these into the Design Guidelines so that they are guiding the process for the consultation that will occur with the Planning Board of Design Review but not be mandatory requirements that would need to be met in order to obtain a building permit because this could create some additional legal hurtles. \n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that he does not see why this cannot be a guide to the Planning Board in their evaluations. He has concern with non-binding review by the City.\n\nMayor McGovern stated that there is vagueness and leaves it open to interpretation. He likes the guidance and if it goes in the zoning it is harder to assess. This should be in the guidelines and not in zoning.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that the Planning Board would use this as an evaluation of whether or not it meets the intent. He noted that the Guidelines mean nothing.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux asked how the Design Guidelines get promulgated or voted upon. Councillor Carlone stated that he feels that guidelines should be voted upon. Vice Mayor Devereux commented that CDD does not want to put guideline in zoning and how is guidelines implemented. \n\nCity Solicitor Glowa stated that in the revised text in 11.207.9 the City Manager has authority to promulgate regulations and Design Guidelines was added to CDD. \n\nCouncillor Mallon spoke about changes to the Guidelines, one of which was a pre-designed analysis of the character of the street was a change in the design guidelines. Mr. Thorkildsen stated that Pre-design analysis of the character of the street was incorporated in a section in the guideline includes the language on page 7 and page 10. Councillor Mallon stated that CDD will have input based on the design guidelines as set forth in this document and intended to be complied with.\n\nCouncillor Carlone asked who is responsible for doing the analysis of the context of the street. Mr. Thorkildsen responded the proponent. Councillor Carlone asked who will review this.  Mr. Thorkildsen stated that it is the basis of the community meetings and the Planning Board\u2019s review and the Affordable Housing Trust\u2019s review.\n\nMr. Roberts stated that one of the changes made in the CDD text to add an additional required community meeting to the process to share the site and street context analysis with the residents and other interested parties prior to building design and to receive feedback. \n\nCouncillor Carlone asked what binds the developer to follow this. Mr. Cotter stated that given the economics of this builders will be building with subsidy funds or coming to the Affordable Housing Trust. He stated that having a report from the Planning Board and staff to the Affordable Housing Trust on the design advisory review and the process that the project went through with the neighbors. With this it is expected that the objectives will be achieved.\n\nOn a motion to move Amendment #41 to the guidelines on an affirmative vote of 9 members the motion was adopted. \n\nAmendments #42-43 and 43A. Councillor Mallon stated that in the revised text CDD has taken the essence of the conversation of the three amendments together. Councillor Carlone moved that the three proposed amendments #42, 43 and 43A be removed. On a voice vote of 9 members the amendment was adopted.\n\nCouncillor Carlone moved to substitute the text from CDD in 11.207.11 (a) and (b) Review of Affordable Housing Overlay. \n\nVice Mayor Devereux commented on the Five-Year Progress Review. She asked should the Planning Board be involved in a five-year review. Mr. Roberts stated that if it is the will of the committee to add this language it could be added. Vice Mayor Devereux moved to amend section (b) to add after Council, the Planning Board.\n\nCouncillor Simmons asked Mr. Cotter if the Planning Board reviews housing policy. Mr. Cotter responded that the Planning Board will review housing policies that intersect with zoning. Vice Mayor Devereux noted that this is zoning. Councillor Carlone noted that CDD is staff to the Planning Board. Mr. Cotter stated that he would like to share the report with the Planning Board and the Affordable Housing Trust. Councillor Simmons moved to amend to add the Affordable Housing Trust.\n\nMayor McGovern stated that there is a difference between sharing a report or being part of the evaluation. This should be done after CDD does evaluation. He will vote to share the evaluation with the Planning Board and the Affordable Housing Trist and not be part of the evaluation.\n\nOn the motion to amend by Vice Mayor Devereux to add the Planning Board. On an affirmative vote of 9 members the amendment was adopted.\n\nOn the motion to amend by Councillor Simmons to add the Affordable Housing Trust. On an affirmative vote of 9 members the amendment was adopted.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux further amended this section to add words \u201cfor its review\u201d after the word \u201cprovide\u201d. On an affirmative vote of 9 members the amendment was adopted.\n\nOn adoption of the entire 11.207.11 and (b) as amended. On an affirmative vote of 9 members the section as amended was adopted.\n\nCouncillor Kelley moved to amend section 11.207.2 to add a new (c) that reads:\n\n(c) An AHO project shall not be permitted on any property whose units are already no more than 100% of AMI.\n\nHe explained his amendment. The housing project are not under 1.0 FAR and limited to a 2.0 FAR and\n\nmay never be redeveloped. \n\nCouncillor Zondervan stated is this stating that this should not apply to those already providing affordable housing. \n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that Councillor Kelley\u2019s amendment is to consider not allowing this to happen where there is existing reasonable density, low-moderate income housing.\n\nCouncillor Kelley stated that if the AHO passes as currently written there may be incentives such as redeveloping existing affordable housing developments because this may be the most cost-effective way to get more affordable housing.\n\nCouncillor Siddiqui stated that she is not comfortable voting on the substantive amendment. At Roosevelt towers is undergoing renovations and it is not to increase units. She will not support this amendment.\n\nCouncillor Simmons stated that this would prevent an existing affordable housing developer from increasing density. Councillor Kelley stated that the AHO as proposed may provide incentives that are difficult to ignore; this may not happen, but it is a possibility. Councillor Simmons stated that she would not support this amendment.\n\nCouncillor Toomey stated that he would not vote in favor of this amendment.\n\nThe question now came on the amendment offered by Councillor Kelley the roll was called and resulted as follows:\n\nYEAS: Councillor Kelley \\- 1\n\nNAYS: Councillor Carlone, Vice Mayor Devereux, Councillor Mallon, Councillor Siddiqui, Councillor Simmons, Councillor Toomey, Councillor Zondervan and \n\nMayor McGovern \\- 8\n\nABSENT: None \\- 0\n\nand the amendment \u2013\n\nFailed.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux commented on Open space in 11.207.5.2.4 (a). She stated that the open space can be reduced to 15% regarding historic preservation. She asked how necessary this is and why cut the open space in half in exchange for protecting historic projects. She noted that when this was originally drafted all of the open space had to be at ground level and subsequently the committee voted to allow 25% of the open space to be above ground if a common roof deck or balcony. She noted that this is not a good idea.\n\nShe stated that in section (b) exempting AHO projects from the requirement that is in the rest of the zoning which some of the open space has to be in a configuration of a 15 X 15 space which is eliminated and without this it means that the open space can be met. She wanted to see a site plan to see how this works and not eliminating so much usable open space that we have no place to plant trees. \n\nCouncillor Zondervan questioned why just completely exempt an historical building or reduce by 50% because it is a historic building.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that the rationale is the historic buildings 2.5 stories high and the rest is 4 stories the units above are missing or you cannot build right up to the historic building on the side. \n\nMayor McGovern commented that there is no formal amendment.\n\nMayor McGovern moved to substitute the entirety of the AHO language as introduced with amendments offered by CDD except as they might conflict with actions taken on September 3, 2019. On an affirmative vote of 9 members the motion carried. \n\nMayor McGovern moved to forward the AHO ordinance as amended to the full City Council with a favorable recommendation. On this motion the roll was called and resulted as follows:\n\nYEAS: Councillor Mallon, Councillor Siddiqui, Councillor Simmons, Councillor Toomey and Mayor McGovern \\- 5\n\nNAYS: Councillor Carlone, Vice Mayor Devereux, Councillor Kelley and Councillor\n\nZondervan \\- 4\n\nABSENT: None \\- 0\n\nAnd the motion \u2013\n\nCarried.\n\nThe following communications relating to the AHOD were received and made part of the record.\n\nCommunication from Sharon Stichter, Walden Street, urging the City Council not to pass this ordinance (ATTACHMENT 53).\n\nCommunication from Nelly LaRosa-waters, 54 Crescent Street, in agreement with all the opposition to this petition (ATTACHMENT 54).\n\nCommunication from Lynn Cetrulo against the AHO plan as it stands (ATTACHMENT 55).\n\nCommunication from Eleanor Marsh, 609 Green Street, requesting that affordable housing is clearly defined for low, moderate and middle income households (ATTACHMENT 56).\n\nCommunication from Ron Jackson, 14 Camp Street, expressed concern with density, parking, larger construction projects, traffic, green/open space and maintenance regarding the AHOD (ATTACHMENT 57).\n\nCommunication from Dean Traweek, 12 Brattle Circle, in opposition to the AHOD proposal (ATTACHMENT 58).\n\nCommunication from James Simpson, 24307 Concord Avenue, expressing strong disapproval with the petition (ATTACHMENT 59).\n\nCommunication from Tom and Sue Owen, 950 Massachusetts Avenue, in opposition to the current AHO plan (ATTACHMENT 60).\n\nCommunication from Bill Skocpol, 66 Huron Avenue, stating that \u201cas of right\u201d abandonment of all zoning regulations will destroy the City (ATTACHMENT 61).\n\nCommunication from Richard Tremaglio, 36 Tierney Street, commenting that the current proposal is not sensitive to the unique urban fabric of Cambridge (ATTACHMENT 62).\n\nCommunication from Jacqueline Landau, Ph.D., 950 Massachusetts Avenue, commenting that this petition has not been done democratically and urging the City Council not to rush through this (ATTACHMENT 63).\n\nCommunication from Carolyn Shipley, 15 Laurel Street, commenting that much is wrong with this proposed zoning (ATTACHMENT 64).\n\nCommunication from George Mouradian, 32 Bowdoin Street, stated that he supports affordable housing but finds that the AHO is deeply flawed (ATTACHMENT 65).\n\nCommunication from Sharon Black, 49 Maple Avenue, urging the City Council not to vote for the AHO zoning proposal (ATTACHMENT 66).\n\nCommunication from Dominick Jones, 6 Hurlbut Street, commenting that the AHO is a dangerous one-sided shamble being currently proposed (ATTACHMENT 67).\n\nCommunication from Kate Canfield expressing deep concerns over the AHO proposal (ATTACHMENT 68).\n\nCommunication from William and Miriam Truslow, 4 Hawthorn Street, commenting that the AHO is a blunt instrument that will irreparably damage the City (ATTACHMENT 69).\n\nCommunication from John and Hilary Hopkins, 30 Winslow Street, in opposition to the zoning proposal (ATTACHMENT 70).\n\nCommunication from Lucy Patton, 333 Walden Street, commenting that the AHO as currently written is not a good idea (ATTACHMENT 71).\n\nCommunication highlighting comments made by Cheryl-Ann Pizza-Zeoli in strong support of the Affordable Housing Overlay (ATTACHMENT 72).\n\nCommunication from Annie Hoffman, Hampshire Street, in opposition to the AHO zoning proposal (ATTACHMENT 73).\n\nCommunication from Lenore G.

Wilson, City Clerk, transmitting Part 4 of the report from Councillor Dennis J. Carlone, Co-Chair and Councillor Craig A. Kelley, Co-Chair of the Ordinance Committee, for a reconvened public hearing held on September 3, 2019 to continue discussions on a proposed amendment to the Zoning Ordinance to create an Affordable Housing Overlay District. \n\nORDINANCE COMMITTEE MEMBERS Councillor Dennis J. Carlone, Co-Chair Councillor Craig Kelley, Co-ChairVice Mayor Jan DevereuxCouncillor Alana Mallon Mayor Marc C. McGovernCouncillor Sumbul Siddiqui Councillor Timothy J. Toomey, Jr. Councillor E. Denise SimmonsCouncillor Quinton Zondervan|   \n---|---  \n  \nRECONVENED ORDINANCE HEARING FROM AUGUST 13, 2019 ON THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING OVERLAY DISTRICT\n\nOn September 3, 2019 Councillor Carlone reconvened the Ordinance Committee hearing from August 13, 2019 at 12:06 PM in the Sullivan Chamber to continue discussions on proposed amendments to the Affordable Housing Overlay District petition. He announced that there will be no public comment. He announced that the hearing was being televised.\n\nPresent were: Councillor Carlone, Vice Mayor Devereux, Councillor Mallon, Councillor\n\nSimmons, Councillor Siddiqui, Mayor McGovern, Councillor Kelley, Councillor Zondervan,\n\nCouncillor Toomey, Erik Thorkildsen, Urban Designer, CDD, City Solicitor Nancy Glowa, Chris\n\nCotter, Director of Housing, CDD, Jeff Roberts, Senior Manager of Zoning and Development,\n\nCDD, Cassie Arnaud, Housing Planning, CDD, City Clerk Anthony Wilson, Will Durbin, Chief of\n\nStaff for Mayor McGovern and Donna P. Lopez, City Clerk\u2019s Office.\n\nAlso present were Elaine DeRosa, 4 Pleasant Place, Marilee Meyer, 10 Dana Street, Skip Schloming, 102R Inman Street, Young Kim, 17 Norris Street, James Zall, 203 Pemberton Street, Elizabeth Gombosi, 42 Irving street, Fritz Donovan, 42 Irving Street, Carol O\u2019Hare, 172 Magazine Street, Lynn Cetnito, 46 Grozier Road, Douglass Payne, 24 Sherman Street and John Pitkin 18 Fayette Street.\n\nCouncillor Carlone outlined the format of the meeting. He noted that the City is the petitioner and there are handouts distributed by Community Development Department including an Affordable Housing Zoning proposal, comparison charts dated August 29, 2019 (ATTACHMENT 46), a memo from Community Development dated August 29, 2019, additions to the Affordable Housing Overlay petition are highlighted in blue and Design Guidelines for 100% Affordable Housing Overlay Draft dated August 29, 2019. He stated that is also a handout compiled by the Mayor\u2019s Office as of September 3, 2019 with the amendments to the Affordable Housing Overlay and this will be used as a guide (ATTACHMENT 47). There is also a handout that outlines which amendments are on hold, pending language from City Solicitor and the items that were referred to Community Development Department (ATTACHMENT 48).\n\nMr. Roberts gave an overview of the material submitted to the Ordinance Committee by e-mail last Thursday. The main document is a revised version of the zoning text (ATTACHMENT 49). There were changes to the proposal that were voted on by the Ordinance Committee and they have been incorporated into the zoning text and made some clarifying changes based on comments by the Planning Board that needed clarification. He spoke about clarifying edits which have also been incorporated into the revised text and includes commentary on the right side to be able to identify the substantive changes. He stated that there is a memo on CDD letter head transmitting supplemental information on questions that were asked at the previous Ordinance Committee hearings (ATTACHMENT 50). This memo includes commentary information relating to Net Zero Ready Buildings, Displacement/Relocation Assistance, Transportation Demand Management Requirements, Density Limits/FAR Caps, Applicability and Import of the Tree Ordinance and Historic Preservation and greater clarification about language in the zoning related to the State Register of Historic Places. He stated that another document was an updated comparison charts and maps that illustrate the provision of the Affordable Housing Overlay compared to the base zoning limitations across the base zoning districts in the zoning ordinance (ATTACHMENT 51). He noted that this was presented with the original proposal and this has been updated based on the recent set of changes voted by the Ordinance Committee. He stated that there is an updated set of Design Guidelines incorporating comments made by the Ordinance Committee (ATTACHMENT 52). Mr. Thorkildsen will provide a summary of the changes. \n\nCouncillor Carlone asked if the key points be reviewed by the staff in the presentation. Mr. Roberts stated that he will go through the substantive changes to the zoning text. Councillor Carlone noted that the FAR is different. Mr. Roberts stated that in response to a change to FAR staff looked at. He stated that there was a report that went to the City Council that was prepared with assistance from the Assessing Department. The basis for AHO proposal is the notation for site to be acquired and for the ability to do affordable housing developments in a way where sites could be feasible acquired and develop would require greater density in order to spread the acquisition costs for sites over a greater number of units. The conclusion depending on the site and acquisition costs of site there could a lot of variation but as an approximate mid-point in lower density residential districts an affordable housing project would need to have a FAR of 2 in order to come up with a feasible acquisition per unit. He stated that a FAR of 2 was seen in those districts as a reasonable limitation that would allow affordable housing developments to be feasible on sites in the lower density areas. He stated that as the analysis that was done shows that there are some sites that this would not be feasible and some it would be depending on the character and nature of the site. This was seen to be a reasonable limitation on density.\n\nMr. Cotter stated that there were several amendments that introduced the idea of FAR and the City Council asked CDD staff to review this and come back with comments as to what would be an appropriate FAR. He stated that building from the analysis recently done with the Assessors and the market to see what level of density might be needed in order to make more sites possible for affordable housing development. He stated that he feels comfortable with the FAR of 2.0 even before discussing the form-based approach that was discussed is deriving from a FAR of 2.0. He stated that with the interest in having a cap on density in the neighbor districts this was taken as a good reason to bring up the 2.0 again. This has been put into the petition and was noted in the memo. Councillor Carlone commented that the non-applicable on the higher density zones means that there is no change in the high-density zones. Mr. Cotter responded in the affirmative and stated that there is no cap on FAR that would apply in the neighborhood districts where the FAR is under 1 there would be a cap set at 2. There is no theorical cap in the corridors or the areas expected to see development, but there is a cap based on the size of the building envisioned based on the number of stories and height. Councillor Carlone asked if the lower density districts being affected and was there any studies done on A2, B, C and C1. Mr. Roberts stated that site study models were previously presented; there were several site development alternatives that modeled a building outcome that would be at a FAR of 2. He explained that when the models were done, they were not shown in specific locations. It was decided that it was preferable to show more generic context rather than picking specific sites. The examples are shown in a context with a range of different buildings that may be typical in Res. A, B, or C or lower density districts. There were 2 alternatives shown. One alternative had more units and less parking with a FAR of 2.4. This would exceed the limitation. The second alternative, referred to as Site 3 Alternative B, shows parking on the site with a FAR of 2. Councillor Carlone asked that the alternatives be resubmitted and reworded and that it be based on the submission of today.\n\nMr. Thorkildsen provided a summary of the changes to the Design Guidelines. The change is in the way that the Guidelines are presented, and the language was simplified. The introduction was revised. The text was cleaned up and included principals and objectives and included Historical Guidelines and included illustrations. Councillor Carlone commented that these are still suggestions. Mr. Thorkildsen stated that these are recommended guidelines and not directives.\n\nCity Solicitor Glowa commented on the definitions of abutters and public way. Ms. Glowa stated that the abutter language is included in the revised text. She stated that on page 23 language has been incorporated from the zoning ordinance and Chapter 40A regarding notice and to whom notice is sent. She stated that she is unclear on what she was to provide committee and welcomes further guidance to provide the information. She stated that received a document that refers to 36A amendment and does not appear to be related to public ways. Councillor Carlone noted that there was some concern about how the public way is defined. He noted that there is an amendment to 36A which adds \u201cand the public way.\u201d City Clerk Wilson referred to section 7.6 in the ordinance there are four subsections and there is a proposal to amend subsection (d) that reads New outdoor light fixtures installed in an AHO project shall be fully shielded and directed to prevent light trespass onto adjacent residential lots and the public way. He noted that a question at the last Ordinance Committee hearing was how to appropriately define public way. Councillor Carlone stated that there was not a definitive definition on public way and informed the City Solicitor that she could get back to the Ordinance Committee on this. City Solicitor Glowa stated that it is unclear what guidance is sought. She stated that there is some light on public ways, and it is not clear whether the committee is looking for language that would keep all light from being shed onto any public way. She stated that she could provide suggested language at the next meeting. Vice Mayor Devereux stated that in the revised Design Guidelines there is now a reference to following some of the suggestion in the Outdoor Lighting Ordinance which was never adopted. She stated that the example that she used was the light at the Tobin School that was not shielded and was intended to be a security light for the school which went well beyond the school grounds and blinded pedestrians who were passing. This was a precaution to acknowledge that lighting that is on a property can spill out into the public way and not be pleasant to pedestrians and not provide security. She did not know how to put this into zoning language. City Solicitor Glowa wanted to figure out how best to address this issue. Councillor Carlone stated that this maybe shielded from the public but letting some indirect light go forward. This is about is glare that the Vice Mayor is referring to. City Solicitor Glowa stated that there is a difference between being shielded and not shedding any light. She stated that there are other places in the zoning ordinance that talks about shielding from direct light trespass onto neighboring properties. She stated that she would work on a proposal that is more refined to get to what the committee is getting at. \n\nCouncillor Carlone proceeded to the amendments that were placed on hold. \n\nAmendment # 1. Councillor Carlone moved to modify his amendment to remove striking out the word \u201climited.\u201d He stated the question is, is 4 times the increase in zoning worthy of the word limited being removed. Vice Mayor Devereux stated that the word limited in this sentence refers to height. This is limited increases in height. She noted that a previous amendment she offered was to add the word incremental. She noted that the increases in height are somewhat limited. On an affirmative vote of 9 members the amendment carried.  City Solicitor noted that the word \u201cincremental\u201d was adopted by the Ordinance Committee on August 8th. Councillor Carlone noted that the word \u201cincremental\u201d was approved on Amendment # 5. Councillor Carlone Councillor Carlone moved to modify his amendment to add after the word \u201callow\u201d the word \u201cincremental\u201d and leave in the word limited. On an affirmative vote of 9 members the amendment carried. \n\nAmendment # 2. Councillor Carlone noted that this was an amendment by Councillor Zondervan to include in the Affordable Housing Overlay Eligible Households by adding at the end the words \u201cor a household that was living in a building that is built or refurbished under the AHO.\u201d\n\nCouncillor Simmons stated that she finds this restrictive and will not support it. She noted that this throws off the AMI configurations. She stated that this is more troublesome and requested that it be removed. \n\nVice Mayor Devereux asked Councillor Zondervan if the household that was living in a building that was either rebuilt or refurbished through the AHO met the guidelines for being an AHO tenant is this the intent. Councillor Zondervan responded that this would already be covered by the existing language. The amendment was to address a situation where tenants are above the income limits and are displaced from their home and would not be allowed to return.\n\nCouncillor Simmons spoke about the funding that AHO projects would have. She noted that this is addressed in the memo by CDD. She stated that if an individual is at market rate and moves out and this will bring the tenant back in. She stated that this is not the purpose of the AHO; the AHO is for individuals under a certain percentage of AMI. Mr. Cotter noted that displacement relocation was addressed in the CDD memo. He stated that the goal is not to displace household and work with households to the extent where relocation may be needed whether it is temporary. In the case where households may be eligible for AHO housing that may be created or permitted where a housing provider will work to help someone identify options either within their other affordable housing stock or within the market. This is problematic to have this type of definition in the zoning because it could conflict with requirements of funding sources as well as present logistical issues where a family may need to be moved to create a housing for seniors and to offer them the right to return would be challenging in terms of compatibility if a building is designed for a certain population it may not be appropriate to have tenants move back and they may have been options in a different type of housing. He added that from a policy perspective this is supported and would want to work through this with the housing providers but to have that element of the definition could be challenging from a practical standpoint as to how AHO housing projects would be financed. On a voice vote amendment # 2 failed.\n\nAmendment # 3. Councillor Carlone stated that this is the definition of a Net Zero Ready Building.\n\nCouncillor Carlone read the proposed definition. He stated that affordable housing developments are more efficient than market rate housing because of costs and eliminating long-term heating and cooling costs. He stated that this definition connects with a later amendment on making buildings meet this standard. He favors doing as much as possible to be efficient.\n\nMr. Cotter this was addressed in the memo and recommended in the memo requiring a narrative for affordable housing projects to show a path to net zero at some point in the future recognizing that getting to net zero at this point can be prohibitively expensive and could undermine efforts to create affordable housing if this requirement were set. He stated that affordable housing is seen as performing better and advancing sustainability for using renewables and making the efforts to create housing that will be better for residents, the community and to operate over time. This is challenging to have this requirement if this were to be a prescriptive requirement. He stated that this definition is challenging as it refers to maximizing without setting standards. He stated that if there were such a definition it was recommended that there are clear standards so that an affordable housing provider would know what the baseline is to meet that definition. He noted that the goal and intention is appreciated but recommends approaching this in a different way. Councillor Carlone stated that the recommendation is to treat this as part of the overall Net Zero Action Plan as far as phasing and not penalize prospective affordable housing. Mr. Cotter stated that the intent in this concept for the AHO petition which was to look at affordable housing providers and not require anything more of them than is now required in the market but trying to give them the advantages to better compete in the market recognizing that the challenges to do that now.\n\nCouncillor Simmons suggested striking out this language based on the recommendations from CDD. She acknowledged that the affordable housing developers built to the highest efficient standards. She noted that this encumbers that process. \n\nCouncillor Zondervan stated that the City cannot allow emissions to increase and causing climate change to continue to worsen and causing death. In 2013 a petition was filed that asked the City to increase energy efficiency requirements and to require new construction be net zero and nothing has been done to date. The City builds net zero with the King Open School Complex and leads by example and cannot ask affordable housing developers to build net zero. He stated that this is not prohibitively expensive, and it is inappropriate to use this term. He added that there is a health and safety issue as well where burning gas in buildings pollutes the indoor air and is unhealthy for the occupants. This does not maximize energy efficiency and are burdening the tenants with unnecessary high utility bills. He stated that from a climate change perspective for the City to say that it needs to continue to build buildings that continue to add to emissions, continue to make climate change worse and continue to kill people is not acceptable to him. Councillor Carlone stated that in the Net Zero Plan what are the projected dates for housing to be Net Zero. Councillor Zondervan responded it is 2022 for small residential construction and 2025 for large residential and commercial buildings. He added that many of the affordable housing projects would not fall under the Net Zero requirements until 2025. \n\nVice Mayor Devereux spoke about the CDD memo and asked why there would be a different way to do this through a net zero narrative and if adopted this requirement would apply to affordable housing projects subject to Green Building Requirements, generally projects of 25,000 square feet or more. When will the Green Building Requirements be adopted? She stated that a project of 25,000 square feet is a 25-unit building. She stated that it is not clear to her how many smaller AHO projects there will be and asked if there will be AHO projects that will be less than 25,000 square feet. Mr. Cotter spoke about the types of affordable housing this would affect. He stated that it is expected to see a range of project types and a way to think about this is the number of units and more units are expected in larger buildings along the corridors. One of the goals of the petition is to create opportunities in areas of the City where there is no affordable housing. He spoke about the types of projects expected with a cap of 2.0 is expected to be on smaller sites in the City. He stated that goal to create sustainable buildings is shared and is in the housing priorities. He stated that this is to create affordable housing and the more that the affordable housing providers are asked to do other things the more the intent is undermined. When this was reviewed with the housing providers the reaction was that it would be more challenging to meet the requirement. He stated that if the zoning has this type of requirement of a narrative for buildings that are 25,000 square feet it would become a fundamental eligibility criterion for the AHO.\n\nMr. Roberts addressed the question about the updates to Green Building Requirement. He stated that they are currently being worked on and will be forwarded to the City Council shortly. This is complex and the roll out of the NZAP. He stated that part of the complexity is that it does not fall entirely within the realm of zoning. This needs to work with the energy code requirements which are not regulated by zoning. He stated that finding the right way to balance zoning along with other standards and requirements and figuring out what can and cannot be regulated is part of the challenge. He stated the roll out complexity of the standards will be worked on by various departments.\n\nCouncillor Kelley appreciates the sentiment and the language that the City is continuing to build buildings that are killing people is super extreme and not super helpful. He stated that the City has passed a plan but is still waiting on a variety of ordinance suggestions to include things like modifying the zoning to allow for different types of insulation that would otherwise bring the building into non-compliance. He noted that there are no zoning requirements that push to Net Zero, there is a plan. Mr. Roberts stated that the AHO zoning proposal refers to the Green Building requirements. He stated that as part of the NZAP there are changes to Green Building Requirements that track the recommendations of the NZAP and includes moving from a baseline standard from LEED Silver to LEED Gold. There are other association improvements. She stated that there are other changes coming with this package, such as flexibility in some zoning standards that are meant to enable adding insulation to an existing building which may be non-conforming and may encounter issues with zoning if trying to add insulation to the exterior of a building. He stated that in the AHO included some flexibility in the zoning that would enable these types of improvements. He stated that there are increases in requirements that need to be met but there are also changes meant to create more flexibility in the zoning that would enable improvements that might otherwise not be able to be made. Councillor Kelley stated that he is confused about what is required at this point and the down the line requirements for creating this plan. He is under the impression that it is being done but not part of the zoning yet. He stated that this proposed amendment seems to leapfrog over current City efforts to change the zoning and other rules to bring people into Net Zero. He added at some point the current efforts will come to the City Council in the form of similar zoning changes. Mr. Roberts responded in the affirmative and further stated that the approach with this proposal as initially conceived is for projects being built under the AHO to continue to track the same environmental standards that would apply to comparable residential developments and as they change in the future then affordable housing projects over this AHO as well as all other residential projects would be subject to the same uniform set of standards.\n\nCouncillor Mallon stated that there are extensive efforts that are being put into place, and this does leapfrog. She spoke about the memo from CDD regarding requiring AHO projects to build to Net Zero standards sooner than otherwise required for all development would put affordable housing builders at a disadvantage relative to the developers of market rate housing. She stated that it is important not see any more stunting of affordable housing and does not want this to stop affordable housing from being built. She stated that she will not support this because of leapfrogging.\n\nAt this time Councillor Carlone called for the vote on amendment # 3. On this motion the roll was called and resulted as follows:\n\nYEAS: Councillor Carlone, Vice Mayor Devereux, Councillor Kelley and Councillor \n\nZondervan \\- 4\n\nNAYS: Councillor Mallon, Councillor Siddiqui, Councillor Simmons, Councillor Toomey and Mayor McGovern \\- 5\n\nABSENT: None \\- 0\n\nand amendment # 3 \u2013\n\nFailed.\n\nAmendment # 4. Councillor Carlone moved to remove this amendment to add a definition for Permeable Parking. On an affirmative vote of 9 member the amendment was adopted.\n\nAmendment # 7. Councillor Carlone amendment was to add after Section 4.35. the words \u201cAll such ground floor uses shall\u201d. He stated that in the revised text on page 5 contains language. He stated that his amendment was services shall be provided to the general public. \n\nCouncillor Mallon stated that in her notes from August 8th she has that this amendment would be discussed with amendment # 32 which was around retail space and whether it could be a use that was non-retail but active related to abutters. Councillor Carlone noted that this is what the zoning specificity calls out. This is active uses. She stated that on page 19 of the revised text in (e) it appears that CDD took the spirit and intention of #7 and #32 and put them together in (e). Councillor Carlone noted that question is the word \u201cmay\u201d or \u201cshall.\u201d\n\nMr. Roberts spoke about section 11.207.4 entitle \u201cUse.\u201d This sets forth what uses are allowed. It is important to establish clearly what uses are allowed. He explained that the AHO only applies to residential uses but there is an exception in an affordable housing overlay project can have some non-residential uses at the ground floor and it is important to clarify what those uses are. In the revised text the reason for the addition is has to do with section 4.34 includes both office and lab uses and there was a question if this meant to include labs and that it would be helpful to clarify that it is only office. This is the reason for the text Paragraphs a. through e. This just states what uses are allowed and this is the intent. He stated that if the City wants to be expansive and encourage active ground floor use it is helpful to be as expansive as is reasonable so that there are different options for what that space can be used for. Councillor Carlone noted that some districts require active ground floor, but this would negate that. Mr. Roberts stated that this section of the zoning is meant to establish that in any zone in districts that allows non-residential uses and could be districts that allow institutional uses, such as community centers, libraries or social services and could include business districts that allow retail use or office districts that allow office uses that in those districts if an affordable housing development is being built under the AHO it can have one of these allowed uses at the ground floor. He stated that this zoning can be utilized for a project that is all affordable housing plus one of these listed non-residential uses that are otherwise allowed in the base zoning at the ground floor. This is not restrictive.\n\nCouncillor Kelley is confused about stories at ground, above and below grade which is found on page 18 of the revised text in paragraph (f) and what is allowed at ground stories. Councillor Carlone stated that this will be addressed later. \n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that based on the explanation of Mr. Roberts he moved to remove his amendment. On an affirmative vote of 9 members the amendment was removed.\n\nAmendment # 8. Councillor Carlone stated that this is an amendment submitted by Councillor Zondervan to insert in Section 4 Use a new (b) (i).\n\nCouncillor Zondervan stated that the idea is to protect existing retail or other services being provided on ground floor in a building that is potentially being redeveloped under the AHO. He stated that the motivation behind this is that there are a lot of single-story buildings along the transit corridors that should have housing on the top. This overlay attempts to create these incentives that will allow this to happen. He stated that without protection for these existing businesses or small business this would make it less likely that those sites would get developed. He spoke about Mayor McGovern\u2019s concern about formula businesses but those can and often are owned by local small business owners who are operating a franchise under a formula business brand. He stated that this underscores the tension and the challenge with this approach because the City is trying to achieve many of the goals at the same time and cannot simply prioritize one goal at the expense of others. He stated that there needs to be some way to protect these existing buildings and using this protection as a way to unlock those development opportunities so that both goals of producing more affordable housing and promoting small local businesses and maintaining vitality on the street. Councillor Carlone stated that he agreed but the amendment is very specific in a rental amount of 5% of the annual gross income. Councillor Zondervan commented that he meant to state no greater than 5%. He stated that this was provided as the right amount to limit so that the business would be able to operate in that space. He spoke about the vacant storefront across the City because of the high rents and further stated that it is important to put a limit on the rent so that these businesses are not being displaced.\n\nMayor McGovern stated that he is opposed to this because affordable housing developer would have to relocate a major business and does not want to do this on the back of affordable housing developers; this is not required of for-profit developers. He is open to any amendment that does not undermine the financial viability of affordable housing. This would be impossible for an affordable housing developer to do. He stated that the City needs to look at how to better support, particularly small businesses but putting this on the backs of affordable housing developers is not right.\n\nCouncillor Siddiqui agreed with the Mayor. She stated that legally this is not tenable. This amendment is unreasonably impractical. There is one goal from the beginning which is to figure out how to make affordable housing more cost effective and this gets in the way of this goal. She commented that the City is trying to figure out what can be done to help the City\u2019s retailers. This does not make sense. \n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that this is an important issue and it needs to be resolved.\n\nCouncillor Simmons understands the idea behind the amendment but it is putting a burden on something that we are trying to correct through an economic development perspective on the AHO. She added that the AHO is not the place for a cure all. This is prohibitive. She stated that the community-based builders have stated that because of so many restrictions and financial burdens it is hard to build affordable housing. She stated that this amendment may be well-intended it is a putting a strain on building affordable housing and making it prohibitive. She requested Councillor Zondervan to withdraw his amendment or she would have to vote against it.\n\nCouncillor Kelley asked when a Special Permit is issued outside of the Massachusetts Avenue Overlay District it requires some amount of retail at the ground floor could the Planning Board require absent the base zoning that there be retail set aside for a project. City Solicitor Glowa responded that the only way that the Planning Board can impose such a requirement is if it exists somewhere within the ordinance provisions that relate to that Special Permit. Councillor Kelley spoke about Huron Village which does not have a ground floor retail requirement and if an individual purchased property today and developed it per the zoning ordinance they would not be required, and the Planning Board could not require them to put in ground floor retail. Mr. Roberts stated that if zoning does not require it, it cannot be specifically required. The Planning Board as part of a more holistic project review takes into account the character of the area, what the planning for the area dictates and the desirable outcome. He stated that there are instances where the Planning Board reviews a project for the first time and comments that the project would be approved if there were retail at some place in the project on the ground floor and this is something that evolves through project review. He stated that in the context of this proposal it would not be appropriate for the Planning Board to require a particular retailer be brought back or put provisions in place regarding the commercial rents that could be charged. Councillor Kelley stated that the lack of a Special Permit process which is proposed for a variety of reasons and this changes the discussion for whatever projects might come. He stated that if the AHO gets passed the rules change dramatically and it is difficult to compare the new rules with current rules. He stated that there is some ability for the Planning Board to push a project to have ground floor retail where the underlining zoning does not require it but is not codified and cannot push overly hard. Mr. Roberts stated that much that is in the AHO proposal does acknowledge that in many areas of the City projects do not require review by the Planning Board. But the acknowledgement of the AHO is meant to create a permitting path that would not require a Special Permit or Variance where they may otherwise might be required. He noted that the AHO does impose specific requirements. He noted that the committee was currently discussing an amendment on relocation and rent for existing retailers. He stated that elsewhere in the AHO there is a requirement that in certain business districts where retail uses are allowed if there is an existing retail use then the AHO must produce an active ground floor space that was intended to continue and support the street front character of the area. \n\nMayor McGovern stated that it would be helpful to stick with the amendment that is in front of the committee. He announced that these changes only apply under a very strict set of rules. This is not about all development or all zoning. He stated that if a 100% affordable housing development is not being built the extra height and the streamline permitting process does not apply. It is important to note that under very specific projects only do these changes apply. This is for a 100% affordable housing projects only. \n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that one of the prime areas for redevelopment is one-story retail districts and will have an impact with retail that is struggling. \n\nVice Mayor Devereux stated that there is a place mentioned later where it states that if there is existing retail in a business district and refers to the AHO. She asked where this appears in the revised text. Mr. Cotter stated that this on page 18 in the revised text in paragraph (e). The Ordinance Committee amended the text from and to or. These would require an AHO project to include ground floor retail in projects that are built on site that had a former retail site or abut another parcel that has a retail use. Mayor McGovern stated that (e) on page 18 of the revised text is not the amendment being discussed. He added that the amendment before the committee is an amendment submitted by Councillor Zondervan about relocation fees and bringing retail back. \n\nVice Mayor Devereux stated that on August 13th the Ordinance Committee voted on this. She added that it is important to remember that the committee did vote on a provision for maintaining retail. She stated that she understands that the amendment by Councillor Zondervan is different but wanted the committee to have the conversation about relocation also remembering that there was a vote to keep the local retail. She added that clearly there is a great deal of confusion about what this zoning actually states. \n\nCouncillor Zondervan commented that this amendment is being characterized as creating an obstacle to affordable housing development and most of these sites will not be developed if there is not some provision to protect the existing retailer in the building. He stated that by not having this provision this is excluding good sites for affordable housing development and this is to unlock more opportunities for affordable housing and if the associated costs are not paid for them the affordable housing will not be built. He stated that this whole zoning is built on the fact that the City is funding, to a large extent, this affordable housing construction. He stated that if the zoning is only addressed and these other obstacles are not the goals may not be achieved of unlocking more affordable housing opportunities. There is a need for something to protect existing businesses in sites that really should have 2-4 stories of affordable housing above the retail.\n\nCouncillor Simmons stated that she did not agree with this in this context. She commented that the zoning is a living document. She recommended vote the amendments the body can and then come back to the other amendments. She urged Councillor Zondervan to withdraw this amendment or let the Ordinance Committee vote on this.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that this is an important issue and this needs to be solved. There are other communities that builds affordable housing above retail.\n\nThe question now came on the amendment and the roll was called and resulted as follows:\n\nYEAS: Councillor Carlone, Councillor Kelley and Councillor Zondervan \\- 3\n\nNAYS: Councillor Mallon, Councillor Siddiqui, Councillor Simmons, Councillor Toomey and\n\nMayor McGovern \\- 5\n\nABSENT: None \\- 0\n\nPRESENT: Vice Mayor Devereux \\- 1\n\nand amendment # 8 \u2013\n\nFailed.\n\nAmendment #13 and #14. Councillor Carlone stated that this has been modified in the presentation by CDD. It was FAR in any district. \n\nMayor McGovern moved adoption of the recommendations by CDD appearing in the revised text as 11.207.5.2.2 Residential Density sections (a) and (b). \n\nMr. Roberts stated that his understanding from the last hearing is that there were some different amendments proposed that would have set different standards for density limitation and were discussed by the Ordinance Committee. The Ordinance Committee asked CDD to review the matter further and came forth with a suggestion. \n\nCouncillor Zondervan stated that he believed that he also had an amendment in a different location. The amendment was part of Amendment # 36 in subsection (d) as follows: Notwithstanding any other requirements, any building permitted through the AHO shall be limited to a Floor Area Ratio (FAR) of 3.0 or double the base zoning, whichever is less, to ensure sufficient land area for green space to mitigate heat and flooding considerations of climate change. Mayor McGovern stated that there were three amendments that dealt with FAR. \n\nMayor McGovern moved to strike amendment # 13. On an affirmative vote of 9 members the amendment was adopted.\n\nCouncillor Carlone moved to strike amendment # 14. On an affirmative vote of 9 members the amendment was adopted.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux questioned the BA-4 district created on Waldon and Sherman Streets relating to the Masse Development. She stated that it would not be included in 2.0 cap; this is a small district. She asked if this was an oversight by CDD not to because it allows height taller than the Masse Building which is under 45 feet.\n\nMr. Robert stated that the overarching principal here is to apply the same variations in height and density for affordable housing development under overlay within districts that are roughly comparable to each other. The BA-4 district was modified to allow a specific development on a specific site, in terms of the overall density and height limitations it is comparable to a Business A or a Business A-2 district. He stated that adjustments were made to make the height lower and density higher but in most respects the density and height are very comparable to Business A. He stated that under this AHO we wanted to treat those districts in roughly comparable ways. Across all these districts, under the most recent height amendment adopted by the Ordinance Committee where it currently allows 44-45 feet the AHO would allow six story buildings. Vice Mayor Devereux stated that she does not think this should be because the Sherman Street district was created specifically to be financially feasible for this development to put parking underground. This density was increased; the height was not increased. She stated that putting a 6-7 story building on Walden Street near Sherman Street is not the outcome wanted. This makes it equivalent to what is allowed on North Massachusetts Avenue in a BA-2 district. This district cannot support a 60-70-foot high building with an unlimited FAR. Councillor Carlone comment that this is an unusual district in that there is very little business in this location. Vice Mayor Devereux does not think that the BA-4 district extends across Walden Street to include Paddy\u2019s. She stated that the zoning for this section should be looked at more closely to see what the City wants to see there. Councillor Kelley asked if Vice Mayor Devereux was submitting amendment of not. Vice Mayor Devereux stated that this came up because she was looking at where the 2.0 FAR does not apply and prompted her to look at why it does not apply and it is because the cut off for capping at 2.0 was to say which ones under the current zoning have a 1.0 FAR or less and because this one was up zoned to help the developer to create to 27 units of housing on the corner lot it was up zoned to 1.75 or 2.0 FAR if it has ground floor retail. This was zoning to enable one project. \n\nVice Mayor Devereux made the following motion:\n\nORDERED: That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to instruct the Community Development Department to review both the density and height under the AHO for the BA-4 district and make a recommendation to the Ordinance Committee. \n\nThe motion was adopted on an affirmative vote of 8 members. Councillor Simmons was recorded\n\nas present.\n\nMayor McGovern stated that he had previously made a motion to accept the recommendation of CDD for 2.0 and suggested voting on this amendment together with the amendment offered by Councillor Zondervan. \n\nThe recommendation by CDD was in the revised text in section 11.207.5.2.2 Residential Density in subsection (a). \n\nCouncillor Carlone questioned that the only place the AHO will work is in areas with a FAR of less than 1.00. Mr. Roberts stated that the proposal is to establish a limit on the FAR in districts where the current district standards would limit it to 1.0 or less. In other districts there would be no maximum FAR. This would be as originally proposed where the development density would be limited by the overall height and the other dimensional controls that are in place and there would not be a numerical limit on FAR. \n\nCouncillor Zondervan stated that the comparison chart has a table that shows each district FAR and the proposed limit. He stated that his understanding of the language is that it only applies if the FAR is less than 1.0. Mr. Roberts stated that there is no district that is 1.0. \n\nVice Mayor Devereux stated that this is trying to make these projects more financially attainable for affordable developers and the ones in .5 districts have higher land values and is the 2.0 a rough guess and how this will work as land values continue to increase. She noted that no districts are being referenced and only referencing where the FAR is less than 1.0 assuming that the zoning passes and lasts for a decade or two there is a possibility that the base zoning districts could change and asked if the committee wanted a reference to the 1.0 or call out which districts this is about. Councillor Carlone stated that every district should have a FAR and be honest about the FAR.\n\nMayor McGovern moved suspension of the rules in order to bring forward Councillor Zondervan\u2019s amendment #36 (d).\n\nCouncillor Zondervan moved to amend the recommendation by CDD by substitution with the language in 36 (d) for (a) in section 11.207.5.2.2. The question came on the motion to amend by substitution and the roll was called and resulted as follows:\n\nYEAS: Councillor Carlone, Vice Mayor Devereux, Councillor Kelley and Councillor\n\nZondervan \\- 4\n\nNAYS: Councillor Mallon, Councillor Simmons, Councillor Toomey and Mayor\n\nMcGovern \\- 4\n\nABSENT: None \\- 0\n\nPRESENT: Councillor Siddiqui \\- 1\n\nAnd the amendment \u2013\n\nFailed.\n\nMayor McGovern proceeded to move adoption of 11.207.5.2.2 residential density (a). On an affirmative vote of 9 members the amendment was adopted.\n\nMr. Roberts clarified the language in 11.207.5.2.2. (b). He stated that in the original version of the petition there was language to the effect that there would be no limitation FAR or lot area per dwelling unit. He explained because now there is a limit on FAR there was the need to move the sentence. \n\nCouncillor Carlone moved adoption of 11.207.5.2.2 (b). On an affirmative vote of 9 members the amendment was adopted.\n\nAmendment # 23. An amendment by Councillor Zondervan to amend (a) in Section 6 Parking and Bicycle Parking. \n\nCouncillor Zondervan noted that this was referred to CDD to review the language. \n\nMr. Roberts stated that on page 12 of the revised text there is new language suggested to the effect of what the Ordinance Committee voted on. He read the revised text in 11.207.6.1 (a). He stated that the language was cleaner. He stated that language was added to 11.207.6.1 (b). He stated that in zoning the standards only apply to parking spaces or loading bays. There are no specific standards for pick up and drop off and deliveries. It was important to establish that the Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department would have a role in certifying that such facilities are being provided in a way that is reasonably suited to accommodate that activity in a way that would not cause significant hazard or congestion and there would be the ability for Traffic and Parking to promulgate regulations so that overtime there could be clearer standards put into place for what would constitute appropriate pick up, drop off and delivery facilities.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux questioned why there would be either on or off-street deliveries because most of this activity is wanted to be off-street. By removing the obligation to provide actual parking spaces does not mean that there will not be any parking in these projects, but this is a broad thing to say. \n\nMr. Roberts stated that after consultation with Traffic, Parking and Transportation stated that things can vary by scale and by existing conditions and if it is a small site or small number of units the concern is having the ability for a small moving van which is routinely handled by Traffic and Parking by issuing permits to allow for this on a temporary basis. \n\nCouncillor Zondervan moved to amend his amendment by substituting in the language suggested by CDD in 11.207.6.1 (a) and (b). On the motion to amend by substitution on an affirmative vote of 9 members the amendment was adopted. The question now came on adoption of the substituted language in 11.207.6.1 (a) and (b). On an affirmative vote of 9 members the amended language was adopted.\n\nAmendment #23C. An amendment by Vice Mayor Devereux. She stated that this was covered in the memo from CDD on the cost of providing a TPass for a full year. \n\nMr. Roberts stated that there is commentary in the CDD memo under the Transportation Demand Management section but is no change to the zoning text. He spoke about the issue of on-going commitments. \n\nMr. Cotter spoke about the perspective of on-going costs and understanding the impact of offering a TPass subsidy would mean to a project in terms of the subsidy and it was found to be significant. He stated that issue as to whether or not such a subsidy on an on-going basis might be considered as income was reviewed. He stated that under a strict definition of income it would be. He stated that at the bottom of page 4 in the memo offered a recommendation to modify the petition text to change the provision of discounted TPasses for three-month duration in the original petition to increase it to six-months. \n\nVice Mayor Devereux commented that what is in the memo did not migrate to the revised text. She moved to amend section 11.207.6.5 Transportation Demand Management in (a) by striking out three- months and substituting in place six-months. She announced that this only applies to AHO projects that are not providing off-street parking at a ratio of .4 space per dwelling unit or more. \n\nCouncillor Simmons spoke about the impact of the TPass. She asked if the TPass would impact income. Mr. Cotter stated that the definition of income under HUD regulations which are applicable to CHA and other housing providers would likely suggest that providing on-going subsidies for a transit pass would be considered income but do not think that it would rise to be considered income if it were provided on a limited or short-term basis. \n\nVice Mayor Devereux moved to amend 11.207.6.5 Transportation Demand Management in (a) by striking out three-months. On an affirmative vote of 9 members the amendment was adopted.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux moved to amend 11.207.6.5 Transportation Demand Management in (a) by inserting six-months. On an affirmative vote of 9 members the amendment was adopted.\n\nCouncillor Carlone now moved that acceptance of 11.207.6.5 Transportation Demand Management in (a) as amended. On an affirmative vote of 9 members the amendment was adopted.\n\nCouncillor Carlone moved a Recess at 2:56 PM.\n\nOn a motion by Councillor Carlone the hearing reconvened at 3:15 PM.\n\nAmendment # 28. To amend 7.3 Building Fa\u00e7ade. This amendment appears in the revised text in 11.207.7.3 (a) and incorporates the recommendations made by Councillor Carlone on the amount of glass in facades going from 15% to 20 % on building facades facing a public street. He stated that the average affordable housing is 23% and market rate housing is 28-30%. He stated that for buildings located in a Business A, Business A-2, Business B or Business C district this figure shall be increased to 30% from 25%. \n\nCouncillor Carlone moved the amendment to 11.207.7.3 (a) by striking out 15% and inserting 20%. On an affirmative vote of 8 members the amendment was adopted. Councillor Simmons was recorded as present. \n\nCouncillor Carlone moved to amend in the business districts by striking out 25% and inserting in place 30%. \n\nCouncillor Mallon questioned if this was a recommendation by CDD or was this a change made based on the discussion at the Ordinance Committee. Mr. Roberts stated that these were changes voted by the Ordinance Committee. Councillor Carlone stated that these were not voted on by the Ordinance Committee but were referred to CDD. He noted that he had written 30% residential and 70% active use on the first floor. There is no comment on this. \n\nMr. Roberts stated that transparent window standards are in the zoning districts throughout the City to try to promote a street friendly character building. He spoke about the overall there is a variation of the windows across the City. He spoke about historic building having a friendly historic character the percentage of windows may be 20-25% and is compatible with surrounding area and create a decent streetscape. He stated that the more requirements in place the more limiting it is on design. He stated another concern is if buildings are being expected to be meeting strong energy efficiency standards in some cases requiring a large amount of clear windows could work counter to this and may have a negative effect.\n\nMr. Thorkildsen stated that in looking at some example facades there were nice facades with a low percentage of glass but had other architectural details. He stated the question about higher percentage ratio on street facades in Business B etc. districts are a good idea but should check some examples. It is not unreasonable to ask for more. Councillor Carlone asked about retail frontage. Mr. Thorkildsen stated that 70% is a reasonable number.\n\nCouncillor Carlone commented that 15% is low and in older buildings the more there is vertical glass windows per people is a friendlier building. He stated that 70% solid is a lot of solid in any room.\n\nMr. Roberts stated that the revised text on page 18 in section (iii) contained a requirement that the portion containing active non-residential uses would be at least 50% transparent glass and based on the Ordinance Committee amendment language was incorporated stating that if it is retail or consumer service it be 70% along one street in case of a corner lot. The language was put in for greater clarity. Councillor Carlone stated that the 30% should not include the ground floor in the calculation; this should be excluded and separate.\n\nCouncillor Carlone moved adoption of the language in the revised text in 11.207.7.3 (a) by striking out 25% and inserting 30%. On an affirmative vote of 9 members the amendment was adopted.\n\nCouncillor Carlone questioned the clarifying revisions by CDD and asked if they need to be adopted. Mr. Roberts stated that in the revised text there are suggested changes made by CDD. There are also clarifying revisions made by CDD. \n\nCity Solicitor stated that the intent was to strike the language in 11.207.7.3 (c) and in addition to recommend adding this language into the Design Guidelines. She stated that a vote is required to strike out the language. Councillor Carlone asked if this was added to the Guidelines. Mr. Thorkildsen responded in the affirmative.\n\nCouncillor Carlone moved to strike out in 11.207.7.3 (c) and move this to the Guidelines. On an affirmative vote of 9 members this amendment was adopted.\n\nCity Solicitor Glowa, in response to a question by Councillor Carlone, stated that the committee needed to move to substitute the entire document submitted by CDD with its various amendments or to vote each clarifying amendment separately. \n\nCouncillor Carlone moved to substitute and replace existing language with the amended language proposed or distributed by CDD to the entire City Council. No action taken.\n\nMayor McGovern suggested that the committee go through the document with the amendments and vote on these amendments and then act on the revised text by CDD.\n\nAmendment #30. Councillor Carlone noted that CDD was to provide the minimum dimensions for a two-way driveway. \n\nMr. Roberts stated that the width of driveways is regulated in Article 6 of the Zoning Ordinance. He stated that the minimum width each way for a one-way driveway is 10 feet and a two-way driveway would be 20 feet. Councillor Carlone asked if there is a need for a walkway on the side of the driveway. This is contained in the revised text in 11.207.7.4 (b).\n\nMr. Roberts stated that there was discussion at the last Ordinance Committee hearing about the amount of space needed for a driveway or a curb cut and is in the zoning in Article 6, so this does not need to be specified in the zoning. He stated that the maximum in residential districts is 20 feet for residential streets and in other districts the maximum is 30 feet. \n\nCity Solicitor Glowa noted that any contextual change needs to be voted upon by the Ordinance Committee. The multicolored document has been what has been worked on. The language in the revised text does contain additional language changes and if the City Council wishes to consider the additional changes it should be voted upon at this time while discussing this section or if there is interest by the committee to move all the changes in this document it would be a different option. \n\nCouncillor Carlone noted that it could be more specific. He remembers it being principal street on a corner lot. He asked could this be the longer street. \n\nMr. Roberts stated that the one change that was not voted on in this motion. He stated that the request was for CDD to provide the minimum dimension for a two-way driveway. His understanding of the intent of the 75% of the length of the fa\u00e7ade to exclude the driveway access and that is why this additional language is there and would need to be voted on. He stated that his recommendation would be to leave this as it is in the revised text. \n\nCouncillor Carlone moved to accept the language provided by CDD in 11.207.7.4 (b). On an affirmative vote of 9 members the amendment was adopted.\n\nCity Solicitor Glowa informed the City Council that any textual changes will need to be voted on by the committee. will this undue any of the changes previously made. She added that the committee has been going through the multicolored document which listed a number of changes that were either voted upon from the original time that document was made. The revised text, the blue document is the text of the actual petition with the changes that CDD and with the assistance of the Law Department has reviewed and provided the changes that were explicitly voted upon by the committee or changes that were requested by the committee. The staff was working from the actual petition language and this other document is confusing. \n\nCouncillor Simmons asked the City Solicitor if the committee took a vote on the textual changes would this undue or change anything that was not voted on up to this point. \n\nMr. Roberts stated that the only change that the committee has voted on today that is not reflected in the revised text is the change regarding the TPass subsidy from three months to six months. The changes that the Ordinance Committee has voted on were changes that were incorporated into the revised text and other clarifying text changes. \n\nCity Solicitor Glowa there is no question of undoing any votes taken. She stated that if committee wishes to it could move to adopt all of the proposed changes in the revised text and any changes in the multicolor document that were voted upon today that are not in the revised text these changes can be inserted into the revised text so that moving forward there would be one integrated document with changes voted upon.\n\nCouncillor Simmons moved to adopt all the proposed changes in the revised text and any changes in the multicolored document that were voted upon today that are not in the revised text and that they be inserted into the revised text. Councillor Carlone suggested that this motion be made at the end of the amendments.\n\nMayor McGovern noted that there are only a few more amendments to go and when completed CDDs amendment can be moved to be accepted. If this is moved out of committee today, CDD will produce a clean document of the text.\n\nAmendment #36B. Councillor Zondervan stated that B is about the Net Zero Ready which was placed on hold pending Article 22 amendments to be submitted to the City Council in September which has a definition of Net Zero Ready. He added that this can be kept on hold or vote to strike this amendment.\n\nMayor McGovern moved to strike in 7.6 (b). The question now came on the amendment and the roll was called and resulted as follows:\n\nYEAS: Councillor Carlone, Councillor Kelley, Councillor Mallon, Councillor Siddiqui, Councillor Simmons, Councillor Toomey and Mayor McGovern \\- 7\n\nNAYS: Councillor Zondervan \\- 1\n\nABSENT: None \\- 0\n\nPRESENT: Vice Mayor Devereux \\- 1\n\nand the amendment to strike out 36B was -\n\nAdopted.\n\nAmendment #36 (c). Councillor Mallon question that the language in the revised text was what was voted on by the committee.\n\nMr. Roberts stated that in the CDD memo there was a request at the last Ordinance Committee to study the cost implications which are incorporated into a section of the CDD memo on tree protection. The language has been incorporated on page 20 in 11.207.7.6 (c) intended to be cleaner. He stated that it is funny to state in zoning that the zoning states that these requirements apply from another ordinance is the one that might exempt projects under this overlay from being subject. This is what was incorporated into the draft. Councillor Mallon wanted to ensure that the committee was voting on the CDD language rather than what was presented in the multicolored document.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux stated that in the CDD language it states it shall comply with the requirements of such ordinance to the extent that it would be required to comply if not an AHO project. Vice Mayor Devereux asked what other projects do not have to comply with the Tree Ordinance. Mr. Roberts stated that under the zoning ordinance only some projects are required to comply with the provisions of the Tree Protection Ordinance as set forth in the zoning and also in the Tree Protection Ordinance. \n\nCouncillor Simmons commented on the CDD memo on page 5 that states making AHO project subject to the requirements of the Tree Ordinance it will make some cost complications. She noted that the whole idea of the AHO was to make it easier or facilitate the building of affordable housing units. She will vote present because it may complicate the AHO and adds a small obstacle in this process. The intent was to clear or make easier the path and this does not do this.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan suggested amendment the CDD language by striking out AHO and inserting in place affordable housing project because it may make it clearer. \n\nCity Solicitor Glowa stated that the Tree Protection Ordinance does not apply to afford housing projects and this language was intended to make it clear that AHO projects would be exempt from the requirements of the Tree Protection Ordinance. \n\nCouncillor Simmons asked does this make it more difficult for developers under the AHO. \n\nMr. Cotter stated that it does make it more complicated to comply with the Tree Protection Ordinance. He stated that adding any requirement does make things more complicated from the standpoint of a housing development provider. This amendment would eliminate the exemption. \n\nCouncillor Simmons stated that this provides a restriction even though well intended and she would be inclined not to support this amendment. \n\nCouncillor Zondervan moved his amendment to strike out AHO and insert affordable housing project and then substitute the revised text language for his original amendment. On a voice vote of 8 members the amendment was adopted. Councillor Simmons was recorded as present.\n\nThe question now came on the motion to substitute the amended revised text for his amendment to the original petition. On this question the roll was called and resulted as follows:\n\nYEAS: Councillor Carlone, Vice Mayor Devereux, Councillor Kelley, Councillor Mallon, Councillor Siddiqui, Councillor Zondervan and Mayor McGovern \\- 7\n\nNAYS: Councillor Simmons \\- 1\n\nABSENT: None \\- 0\n\nPRESENT: Councillor Toomey \\- 1\n\nand the amendment was \u2013\n\nAdopted.\n\nCouncillor Carlone now moved that the 11.207.7.6 (c) be amended to strike out AHO an insert the words affordable housing project. On an affirmative vote of 9 members the amendment was adopted.\n\nAmendment #36A. Councillor Mallon asked is ISD able to decide based on whether this is fully shielded. \n\nCity Solicitor Glowa stated that shielded may be more appropriate than fully-shielded. She stated that she will look at existing language, confer with the Commissioner of Inspectional Services and report back to the committee at the next meeting.\n\nCouncillor Mallon wanted fully shielded kept. \n\nAmendment #41 Overlay Design Consultation Objectives.\n\nCouncillor Carlone wanted to state the objectives clearly. \n\nCity Solicitor Glowa stated that one of the sensitivities here is the appealability of any. In this case this case the requirement for a Special Permit has been removed but a developer of an AHO project would still need a building permit and building permits are appealable. By having language that is more subjective or qualitative as opposed to quantitative requirements there is the possibility that this could open the City or developer up to having a building permit appealed on the basis that there are some unclear standards here in the zoning ordinance. An opponent of the project could state that they did not meet the requirements. So, the recommendation was to move these into the Design Guidelines so that they are guiding the process for the consultation that will occur with the Planning Board of Design Review but not be mandatory requirements that would need to be met in order to obtain a building permit because this could create some additional legal hurtles. \n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that he does not see why this cannot be a guide to the Planning Board in their evaluations. He has concern with non-binding review by the City.\n\nMayor McGovern stated that there is vagueness and leaves it open to interpretation. He likes the guidance and if it goes in the zoning it is harder to assess. This should be in the guidelines and not in zoning.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that the Planning Board would use this as an evaluation of whether or not it meets the intent. He noted that the Guidelines mean nothing.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux asked how the Design Guidelines get promulgated or voted upon. Councillor Carlone stated that he feels that guidelines should be voted upon. Vice Mayor Devereux commented that CDD does not want to put guideline in zoning and how is guidelines implemented. \n\nCity Solicitor Glowa stated that in the revised text in 11.207.9 the City Manager has authority to promulgate regulations and Design Guidelines was added to CDD. \n\nCouncillor Mallon spoke about changes to the Guidelines, one of which was a pre-designed analysis of the character of the street was a change in the design guidelines. Mr. Thorkildsen stated that Pre-design analysis of the character of the street was incorporated in a section in the guideline includes the language on page 7 and page 10. Councillor Mallon stated that CDD will have input based on the design guidelines as set forth in this document and intended to be complied with.\n\nCouncillor Carlone asked who is responsible for doing the analysis of the context of the street. Mr. Thorkildsen responded the proponent. Councillor Carlone asked who will review this.  Mr. Thorkildsen stated that it is the basis of the community meetings and the Planning Board\u2019s review and the Affordable Housing Trust\u2019s review.\n\nMr. Roberts stated that one of the changes made in the CDD text to add an additional required community meeting to the process to share the site and street context analysis with the residents and other interested parties prior to building design and to receive feedback. \n\nCouncillor Carlone asked what binds the developer to follow this. Mr. Cotter stated that given the economics of this builders will be building with subsidy funds or coming to the Affordable Housing Trust. He stated that having a report from the Planning Board and staff to the Affordable Housing Trust on the design advisory review and the process that the project went through with the neighbors. With this it is expected that the objectives will be achieved.\n\nOn a motion to move Amendment #41 to the guidelines on an affirmative vote of 9 members the motion was adopted. \n\nAmendments #42-43 and 43A. Councillor Mallon stated that in the revised text CDD has taken the essence of the conversation of the three amendments together. Councillor Carlone moved that the three proposed amendments #42, 43 and 43A be removed. On a voice vote of 9 members the amendment was adopted.\n\nCouncillor Carlone moved to substitute the text from CDD in 11.207.11 (a) and (b) Review of Affordable Housing Overlay. \n\nVice Mayor Devereux commented on the Five-Year Progress Review. She asked should the Planning Board be involved in a five-year review. Mr. Roberts stated that if it is the will of the committee to add this language it could be added. Vice Mayor Devereux moved to amend section (b) to add after Council, the Planning Board.\n\nCouncillor Simmons asked Mr. Cotter if the Planning Board reviews housing policy. Mr. Cotter responded that the Planning Board will review housing policies that intersect with zoning. Vice Mayor Devereux noted that this is zoning. Councillor Carlone noted that CDD is staff to the Planning Board. Mr. Cotter stated that he would like to share the report with the Planning Board and the Affordable Housing Trust. Councillor Simmons moved to amend to add the Affordable Housing Trust.\n\nMayor McGovern stated that there is a difference between sharing a report or being part of the evaluation. This should be done after CDD does evaluation. He will vote to share the evaluation with the Planning Board and the Affordable Housing Trist and not be part of the evaluation.\n\nOn the motion to amend by Vice Mayor Devereux to add the Planning Board. On an affirmative vote of 9 members the amendment was adopted.\n\nOn the motion to amend by Councillor Simmons to add the Affordable Housing Trust. On an affirmative vote of 9 members the amendment was adopted.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux further amended this section to add words \u201cfor its review\u201d after the word \u201cprovide\u201d. On an affirmative vote of 9 members the amendment was adopted.\n\nOn adoption of the entire 11.207.11 and (b) as amended. On an affirmative vote of 9 members the section as amended was adopted.\n\nCouncillor Kelley moved to amend section 11.207.2 to add a new (c) that reads:\n\n(c) An AHO project shall not be permitted on any property whose units are already no more than 100% of AMI.\n\nHe explained his amendment. The housing project are not under 1.0 FAR and limited to a 2.0 FAR and\n\nmay never be redeveloped. \n\nCouncillor Zondervan stated is this stating that this should not apply to those already providing affordable housing. \n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that Councillor Kelley\u2019s amendment is to consider not allowing this to happen where there is existing reasonable density, low-moderate income housing.\n\nCouncillor Kelley stated that if the AHO passes as currently written there may be incentives such as redeveloping existing affordable housing developments because this may be the most cost-effective way to get more affordable housing.\n\nCouncillor Siddiqui stated that she is not comfortable voting on the substantive amendment. At Roosevelt towers is undergoing renovations and it is not to increase units. She will not support this amendment.\n\nCouncillor Simmons stated that this would prevent an existing affordable housing developer from increasing density. Councillor Kelley stated that the AHO as proposed may provide incentives that are difficult to ignore; this may not happen, but it is a possibility. Councillor Simmons stated that she would not support this amendment.\n\nCouncillor Toomey stated that he would not vote in favor of this amendment.\n\nThe question now came on the amendment offered by Councillor Kelley the roll was called and resulted as follows:\n\nYEAS: Councillor Kelley \\- 1\n\nNAYS: Councillor Carlone, Vice Mayor Devereux, Councillor Mallon, Councillor Siddiqui, Councillor Simmons, Councillor Toomey, Councillor Zondervan and \n\nMayor McGovern \\- 8\n\nABSENT: None \\- 0\n\nand the amendment \u2013\n\nFailed.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux commented on Open space in 11.207.5.2.4 (a). She stated that the open space can be reduced to 15% regarding historic preservation. She asked how necessary this is and why cut the open space in half in exchange for protecting historic projects. She noted that when this was originally drafted all of the open space had to be at ground level and subsequently the committee voted to allow 25% of the open space to be above ground if a common roof deck or balcony. She noted that this is not a good idea.\n\nShe stated that in section (b) exempting AHO projects from the requirement that is in the rest of the zoning which some of the open space has to be in a configuration of a 15 X 15 space which is eliminated and without this it means that the open space can be met. She wanted to see a site plan to see how this works and not eliminating so much usable open space that we have no place to plant trees. \n\nCouncillor Zondervan questioned why just completely exempt an historical building or reduce by 50% because it is a historic building.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that the rationale is the historic buildings 2.5 stories high and the rest is 4 stories the units above are missing or you cannot build right up to the historic building on the side. \n\nMayor McGovern commented that there is no formal amendment.\n\nMayor McGovern moved to substitute the entirety of the AHO language as introduced with amendments offered by CDD except as they might conflict with actions taken on September 3, 2019. On an affirmative vote of 9 members the motion carried. \n\nMayor McGovern moved to forward the AHO ordinance as amended to the full City Council with a favorable recommendation. On this motion the roll was called and resulted as follows:\n\nYEAS: Councillor Mallon, Councillor Siddiqui, Councillor Simmons, Councillor Toomey and Mayor McGovern \\- 5\n\nNAYS: Councillor Carlone, Vice Mayor Devereux, Councillor Kelley and Councillor\n\nZondervan \\- 4\n\nABSENT: None \\- 0\n\nAnd the motion \u2013\n\nCarried.\n\nThe following communications relating to the AHOD were received and made part of the record.\n\nCommunication from Sharon Stichter, Walden Street, urging the City Council not to pass this ordinance (ATTACHMENT 53).\n\nCommunication from Nelly LaRosa-waters, 54 Crescent Street, in agreement with all the opposition to this petition (ATTACHMENT 54).\n\nCommunication from Lynn Cetrulo against the AHO plan as it stands (ATTACHMENT 55).\n\nCommunication from Eleanor Marsh, 609 Green Street, requesting that affordable housing is clearly defined for low, moderate and middle income households (ATTACHMENT 56).\n\nCommunication from Ron Jackson, 14 Camp Street, expressed concern with density, parking, larger construction projects, traffic, green/open space and maintenance regarding the AHOD (ATTACHMENT 57).\n\nCommunication from Dean Traweek, 12 Brattle Circle, in opposition to the AHOD proposal (ATTACHMENT 58).\n\nCommunication from James Simpson, 24307 Concord Avenue, expressing strong disapproval with the petition (ATTACHMENT 59).\n\nCommunication from Tom and Sue Owen, 950 Massachusetts Avenue, in opposition to the current AHO plan (ATTACHMENT 60).\n\nCommunication from Bill Skocpol, 66 Huron Avenue, stating that \u201cas of right\u201d abandonment of all zoning regulations will destroy the City (ATTACHMENT 61).\n\nCommunication from Richard Tremaglio, 36 Tierney Street, commenting that the current proposal is not sensitive to the unique urban fabric of Cambridge (ATTACHMENT 62).\n\nCommunication from Jacqueline Landau, Ph.D., 950 Massachusetts Avenue, commenting that this petition has not been done democratically and urging the City Council not to rush through this (ATTACHMENT 63).\n\nCommunication from Carolyn Shipley, 15 Laurel Street, commenting that much is wrong with this proposed zoning (ATTACHMENT 64).\n\nCommunication from George Mouradian, 32 Bowdoin Street, stated that he supports affordable housing but finds that the AHO is deeply flawed (ATTACHMENT 65).\n\nCommunication from Sharon Black, 49 Maple Avenue, urging the City Council not to vote for the AHO zoning proposal (ATTACHMENT 66).\n\nCommunication from Dominick Jones, 6 Hurlbut Street, commenting that the AHO is a dangerous one-sided shamble being currently proposed (ATTACHMENT 67).\n\nCommunication from Kate Canfield expressing deep concerns over the AHO proposal (ATTACHMENT 68).\n\nCommunication from William and Miriam Truslow, 4 Hawthorn Street, commenting that the AHO is a blunt instrument that will irreparably damage the City (ATTACHMENT 69).\n\nCommunication from John and Hilary Hopkins, 30 Winslow Street, in opposition to the zoning proposal (ATTACHMENT 70).\n\nCommunication from Lucy Patton, 333 Walden Street, commenting that the AHO as currently written is not a good idea (ATTACHMENT 71).\n\nCommunication highlighting comments made by Cheryl-Ann Pizza-Zeoli in strong support of the Affordable Housing Overlay (ATTACHMENT 72).\n\nCommunication from Annie Hoffman, Hampshire Street, in opposition to the AHO zoning proposal (ATTACHMENT 73).\n\nCommunication from Lenore G.

He stated that his friend did not have the appropriate lot size and other dimensional requirements to get an accessory dwelling unit, so he decided to seek a variance. He stated that the variance process required an attorney and delayed the project and had a financial implication. He stated that the existing Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) zoning ordinance could be fixed relating to the requirement for a variance. He stated that it is hard to estimate how many people need to get a variance for an ADU. The way that the Board of Zoning Appeals cases are filed does not allow for an accurate data search. It is impossible to get the number for those who apply for a variance. \n\nHe gave a PowerPoint presentation (ATTACHMENT B). Councillor Kelly stated that the basic regulatory program already exists in section 4.22 of the Zoning Ordinance created in the l970s and updated within the last few years. The City wants people to have ADU, but the method does not work perfectly. The City wants to create more housing opportunities without creating new and bigger buildings. He stated that the basic theme of an ADU is it has the footprint and the size of an existing building and figure out how to turn it into another dwelling unit. He stated that pre-existing garages being used for an ADU is a sticking point. In this proposal pre-existing separate structures would only be a garage. \n\nThe Planning Board was concerned with. It seems arbitrary to pick a date and state that an ADU should be done before a specific date. He stated that Short Term Rental discussion is continuing and on a separate track rather than be lumped into this petition. He stated that the start date is irrelevant to operations\n\nHe highlighted the intent of the proposed amendment is to allow individuals to create ADU. This is not to suggest houses get higher, but a basement apartment may end up changing the mean grade of the housing by putting in an egress for the basement. He stated that to allow existing unmodified free-standing structures like garages to be used as ADU, get rid of parking requirements and lot size requirements as they impact ADU and eliminate height requirement for basement egress and entrance. He noted that there may be setback concerns. He stated that the proposed amendment would eliminate these concerns. He stated that this may increase the value of property. The language was clarified for existing garages rather than a garage being built then used as an ADU. This would only be used for single- and two-family homes. He stated that detached ADUs might negatively impact the neighbor\u2019s privacy. \n\nHe stated that there is still a need for Special Permits and the Planning Board can impose conditions to respect the look, feel, character and privacy of a neighborhood. He submitted a proposed amendment as a substitution in a memorandum dated April 1, 2019 (ATTACHMENT C). Councillor Kelley\u2019s motion to amend by substitution was the document labeled ADU Language - Clean. He stated that this captures the concerns of the Planning Board. The question now came on the amendment by substitution of the previous zoning proposal - and on a voice vote the motion to amend by substitution carried on a voice vote of seven members. \n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that the Planning Board discussed this petition last week and there is no Planning Board report yet. He stated that in the future the Ordinance Committee would like to schedule hearings once there is a Planning Board written report to get a full representation of the hearing.\n\nMr. Roberts spoke about the timeline. He stated that Planning Board first hearing the petition on January 22, 2019 and a recommendation was sent to the City Council on March 4, 2019 (ATTACHMENT D). He stated that the following week the Ordinance Committee held a hearing and questions were raised and a substituted version was submitted. He stated that one of the key recommendations of the Planning Board at the first hearing was their interest in having City staff carefully review the language to make sure that it was clear what the intent was and how the intent would be manifested in the application of the zoning language. The members of the Planning Board expressed concerns whether it would be clear enough in stating what the different rights and requirements of an accessory apartment would be under the proposal. The Planning Board supported the petition at a substantive level but felt that staff should review it. \n\nMr. Roberts stated that after the Planning Board hearing the Community Development Department discussed the petition internally. He stated that one of the suggestions that was to have the Planning Board look at the revised version of the petition text, text reviewed by the Ordinance Committee on February 2, 2019, and decide if the Board wanted to make any adjustments to the Planning Board recommendations. This is what was reviewed by the Planning Board at its meeting on Tuesday along with additional material compiled by staff. He stated that at the last Planning Board hearing revisions were made to the Planning Board recommendations that will be communicated to the City Council in a report. He noted that many of the comments by the Planning Board were the same as the previous report. \n\nHe stated that the Planning Board felt that it is important that staff look at language carefully and make sure that it can be applied clearly for cases that go before the BZA for Special Permits. Councillor Carlone stated that no formal approval should occur until the Planning Board recommendations are received and discussed. He asked if this would go back to Planning Board or is it in the hands of the staff for review. Mr. Roberts responded that regarding the timing of the petition it may be difficult for this to go back to the Planning Board for review. He stated that when the Planning Board votes a recommendation generally it is left in the hands of staff, but it was important for the Planning Board to be clear about what version of the petition they were reviewing and that the language needed more careful review by staff before moving forward. Mr. Roberts stated that the Planning Board supported petition in content and had concerns with modifications to the petition.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux asked about the language that was just substituted. She asked Councillor Kelley if he made the redline changes after the hearing last week by the Planning Board. Councillor Kelley responded in the affirmative. Vice Mayor Devereux spoke about the language matching others portions of the zoning ordinance so that the same terms were being used consistently she was unclear about this.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan asked what it means to get rid of the lot size requirements that impact the ADU; what are the implications. Councillor Kelley stated that under the zoning code a specific lot size is needed to have a certain number of units. He stated that if a unit is added to a lot size that is too small to have that number of units more lot size would be needed for the ADU. He stated that the theme is that the ADU does not change the outside of a building significantly. He spoke about what would be covered by a Special Permit application. There is no relief needed for the lot size needed. Councillor Zondervan ask why there needs to be special rules for an ADU. If a certain level of density of dwelling units is good, then why not have this true across the board and why is there a need for special rules for adding a dwelling unit to an existing building if in compliance with the zoning ordinance. Councillor Kelley stated the ADU is for existing structures only. Councillor Zondervan asked why only get rid of parking requirement for ADU and not across the board. Councillor Kelley stated that they could be eliminated across the board, but this was intended to be a narrow fix to a small part of the zoning ordinance and has turned into a larger discussion on ADUs. He wanted to have the parking discussion at a different time than during this particular petition. He stated that zoning is a challenging tool and difficult to go through this process for a small change.\n\nCouncillor Mallon agreed with the Planning Board that staff needs to look at language to ensure that it conforms with the zoning ordinance. She is curious around the timing of this petition. She asked when the Community Development Department staff will come back to the Ordinance Committee with the language. Mr. Roberts stated that the staff can provide language and send it back to the City Council but that the petition expires in the beginning of May. He stated that within this time the staff can review the language and come back to the City Council with the language. There is no fixed time line. Councillor Mallon asked whether there be enough time to receive the language, hold another Ordinance Committee hearing and be able to ordain this amendment before the petition expires. Councillor Carlone responded that there is not enough time and will need to be discussed at the end of the hearing. \n\nCouncillor Carlone opened public comment at 2:37 PM.\n\nNels Frye, 40 Sherman Street, stated that he would like to build an ADU and convert part of an existing structure into an ADU so that when he returns he does not have to live with his mother. There is a garden which was part of the Secret Garden tour in 2018 to benefit the public library that had 150 visitors in the garden. He stated that the carrying costs for the property are high, so it is rented. The goal would be to add an ADU for his mother to live in. This would allow increased housing by allowing ADU without going before BZA. He stated that the mortgage and property taxes are too expensive and to recover the cost building a studio would help the financing. \n\nCarol O\u2019Hare, 172 Magazine Street, stated that she is not talking about substance; she is talking about process. She commented to not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. She stated let the (near) perfect be the enemy of the good. The Planning Board, the Community Development Department and the Law Department are skilled employees and there is no reason for this \u201cprocess.\u201d She stated that process is important and the definitions are not tied down. There is no reason to make the zoning ordinance more complicated than it is now. There are four different versions floating around for this petition. She has lost track of this petition. She urged the Ordinance Committee to please fix this and let it fly when fixed. \n\nLee Farris, 269 Norfolk St., stated that she just saw redline version submitted by Councillor Kelley. She wanted Councillor Kelley to go through the changes and his reasons and therefore she has no comments on this. She does not have a basis to comment.\n\nPatrick Barrett, 41 Pleasant Street, stated that he wrote the original ADU amendment to the ordinance based on feedback from community and from the state that outlined how they wanted ADU meted out across other municipalities. At the time of the first Planning Board hearing there was a question raised - is there is definition of basement in the ordinance. He stated that the answer is no, but in Article II where a definition does not exist you look to the Building Code, which does contain a robust definition. He stated that there is accessory building definition in the zoning, but no definition of accessory structure. The Building Code does contain a definition, and this is something that the Planning Board knows as well as the Law Department. He stated that when there are gaps understanding how these words are meted out and the ordinance is ripe with this. He stated that dwelling unit is categorized as different thing. \n\nHe added that there are inconsistencies throughout the ordinance. He stated that the height of a building is measured by the mean grade and this is altered when you add a window well and need a variance. This is what is going on at the Inspectional Services Department. He stated that ADUs lot size and lot per dwelling were confused. He stated that if the variance is removed it does not alter the requirement. This is zoning change - to make a small change to Article IV. He stated that the intent of this proposal was outlined by the first speaker. It is not easy to get a variance at the BZA. The small changes become a quality of life issue for people.\n\nCouncillor Carlone closed public committee at 2:52 PM.\n\nCouncillor Carlone opened discussion on the issue. He does not question the substance of the changes made by Councillor Kelley but clearly city staff will review language and get back to the City Council.\n\nCouncillor Kelley stated that he wanted this kept in committee and reported out to the full City Council. He stated that from a process standpoint he tried to incorporate the Ordinance Committee and the Planning Board changes. He is doing his best to get changes before the City Council before voting on it. The Planning Board had a less understanding of the goal of the proposal and these are better addressed in this version. He stated that there are a variety of inconsistencies in the existing zoning ordinance.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux stated that the memo from Community Development Department dated March 21, 2019 54.00 contained a chart that included the summaries of BZA accessory apartment cases between 2016-2018. The chart shows five cases and one applicant withdrew. She stated that three of the four that went through the process needed variances; two of which were for having a lot size less than 5,000 square feet. She asked Councillor Kelley about his comment that the Planning Board wanted to review and noted that the Special Permits will be granted by BZA not the Planning Board. She asked if there is a record of Special Permits that the BZA granted for ADU that did not require a variance. \n\nMr. Roberts stated that he did a quick scan of BZA agendas for the past two years for ADU, including ADU cases that came before the BZA and the majority of the cases did need a variance in addition to the Special Permit for the ADU. He stated that the chart contains the extent of the cases for ADU found on BZA agendas. \n\nVice Mayor Devereux stated that only one of the five required no other relief and received a Special Permit. She commented that when the ADU zoning was approved it was thought that there would be 1,000 units created out of this. She added it is strange that no one did an ADU even without needing a variance. Councillor Carlone stated that having gone through the variance process - it requires significant work and he cannot image most people considering this. He spoke about this path being faster to add ADUs maybe the path is not an indication of the future.\n\nCouncillor Siddiqui stated that five people were interested and suggested doing an ADU 101 to let people know that ADU is available and what it can do. There needs more education on this. An outreach plan is needed.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan stated that he is struggling with the bigger question and understands it is important to simplify this section. He asked why special zoning is needed to allow people to build a unit in their existing building if it is compliant with the Building Code. Why would the City get involved at all, he asked? This would allow higher density in existing structures than in new structures. He spoke about simplifying zoning overall. He stated that this seems to be making the problem worse by creating further inconsistencies. He spoke about simplifying the zoning overall so that there are not so many inconsistencies. \n\nCouncillor Carlone stated this is reusing existing structures in a more efficient way and if a person can add a second parking space in a single-family house, they will because they can charge for it. New unit sizes are smaller than older, existing structures. Councillor Zondervan stated that the zoning ordinance should be more consistent. There should not be different rules for existing structures that allow more units than for new structures. Councillor Carlone stated that this is looking at 1-2 family structures. He stated that this is looking at the reservoir of existing structures, many of which are large. He stated that broader zoning changes will literally take years for resolution.\n\nCouncillor Mallon stated that Councillor Kelley\u2019s memo stated that this is not an attempt to address large inconsistencies in the zoning ordinance. She stated that having a conversation about the large zoning ordinance is not a good idea. She asked for clarification that this zoning amendment was to address accessory structures and the ability to build ADU in accessory structures, which was not allowed in the previous amendment. Councillor Kelley responded that currently this cannot be done, and the thought would be if one had an accessory structure, defined in the International Building Code, that would be if the other conditions are met it could be turned into an ADU. Councillor Mallon stated that she does not have 900 square feet in her house but does have an existing garage for an ADU. She added that this amendment may open the ability for more ADU to be built which is the goal.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux stated that on the chart two of the examples were new construction of single-family homes. She asked can a single family be built with an ADU. Is this really saying that only existing structures can have an ADU. Councillor Carlone stated that new construction would need to go for a variance. \n\nCity Solicitor Glowa stated that over the last several years there has been an interest in defining certain accessory units, as being somehow distinct from what otherwise would be considered a two-family. A two-family does not relate typically to a traditional zoning context or in most zoning cases that talk about zoning ordinances, it does not matter whether it is the same size as the larger units, or whether it is a so-called in-law unit or an accessory unit. She stated that if Residence A allows for 2 families then you can have an in-law unit in your large house. She added that these definitions have been shifting over the last few years as people have been working to create exceptions for or allowances for re-use of some aspects of building to accommodate these various types of accessory uses as part of existing structure. So, the basement unit change was one of the changes to differentiate between ADU and a two-family. This is confusing and could use clarification. She stated that a dwelling unit is a dwelling unit and whether it is called an ADU you are allowing another dwelling unit in a structure or if allowing another dwelling unit on a parcel such as a garage on a parcel this also is another dwelling unit. She added that this needs to be reconciled to make it more understandable to people.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan said it is important to have this conversation in the context of the overall zoning ordinance. He stated that he is highlighting this issue and if the zoning gets finer in the weeds of certain sections it gets more confusing and at some point, it makes sense to go back and look at the whole thing. He stated that if it makes sense to allow higher density of dwelling units whether it is an existing or new structure then maybe the entire zoning ordinance needs to be reviewed to get the same level of density everywhere. He spoke again about enforcement and if it complies with Building Code why do we have to get involved. He stated that there are better ways to accomplish these goals.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that he has been involved with this City for 45 years and 45 years ago it was said that the zoning code needed to be simplified and updated. He stated that having the Building Code be the basis is insufficient. The Zoning Code and the Building Code work together to create a safe and sensible city of buildings.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux stated that to make this clear she moved to amend 4.22.1 by adding after the words \u201calteration of\u201d the words \u201c\u201dan existing\u201d (ATTACHMENT E). Councillor Kelley stated that if this will make it read better to people and it is clearer it is a great idea.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that all zoning goes through Community Development and the Law Department and this is what is being asked for this petition. He stated that Mr. Roberts and Ms. Glowa have not had time to look at the current version and their input is needed. \n\nVice Mayor Devereux now moved her amendment- and on a voice vote of six members the amendment -\n\nCarried.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that given the timing of the petition this could be ordained by May 6th if submitted to the full City Council based on getting a refined and approved version from the City staff and the proposal could be moved to a second reading on April 22, 2019. \n\nCouncillor Carlone moved the petition as amended by substitution by Councillor Kelley and further amended by Vice Mayor Devereux be referred to the full City Council with a favorable recommendation based on getting a refined text from City staff. The motion carried on a voice vote of six members.\n\nCouncillor Carlone and Councillor Kelley thanked all those present for their attendance.\n\nThe hearing adjourned at 3:17 PM\n\nFor the Committee,\n\n__________________________________\n\nCouncillor Dennis J.

She stated that three of the four that went through the process needed variances; two of which were for having a lot size less than 5,000 square feet. She asked Councillor Kelley about his comment that the Planning Board wanted to review and noted that the Special Permits will be granted by BZA not the Planning Board. She asked if there is a record of Special Permits that the BZA granted for ADU that did not require a variance. \n\nMr. Roberts stated that he did a quick scan of BZA agendas for the past two years for ADU, including ADU cases that came before the BZA and the majority of the cases did need a variance in addition to the Special Permit for the ADU. He stated that the chart contains the extent of the cases for ADU found on BZA agendas. \n\nVice Mayor Devereux stated that only one of the five required no other relief and received a Special Permit. She commented that when the ADU zoning was approved it was thought that there would be 1,000 units created out of this. She added it is strange that no one did an ADU even without needing a variance. Councillor Carlone stated that having gone through the variance process - it requires significant work and he cannot image most people considering this. He spoke about this path being faster to add ADUs maybe the path is not an indication of the future.\n\nCouncillor Siddiqui stated that five people were interested and suggested doing an ADU 101 to let people know that ADU is available and what it can do. There needs more education on this. An outreach plan is needed.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan stated that he is struggling with the bigger question and understands it is important to simplify this section. He asked why special zoning is needed to allow people to build a unit in their existing building if it is compliant with the Building Code. Why would the City get involved at all, he asked? This would allow higher density in existing structures than in new structures. He spoke about simplifying zoning overall. He stated that this seems to be making the problem worse by creating further inconsistencies. He spoke about simplifying the zoning overall so that there are not so many inconsistencies. \n\nCouncillor Carlone stated this is reusing existing structures in a more efficient way and if a person can add a second parking space in a single-family house, they will because they can charge for it. New unit sizes are smaller than older, existing structures. Councillor Zondervan stated that the zoning ordinance should be more consistent. There should not be different rules for existing structures that allow more units than for new structures. Councillor Carlone stated that this is looking at 1-2 family structures. He stated that this is looking at the reservoir of existing structures, many of which are large. He stated that broader zoning changes will literally take years for resolution.\n\nCouncillor Mallon stated that Councillor Kelley\u2019s memo stated that this is not an attempt to address large inconsistencies in the zoning ordinance. She stated that having a conversation about the large zoning ordinance is not a good idea. She asked for clarification that this zoning amendment was to address accessory structures and the ability to build ADU in accessory structures, which was not allowed in the previous amendment. Councillor Kelley responded that currently this cannot be done, and the thought would be if one had an accessory structure, defined in the International Building Code, that would be if the other conditions are met it could be turned into an ADU. Councillor Mallon stated that she does not have 900 square feet in her house but does have an existing garage for an ADU. She added that this amendment may open the ability for more ADU to be built which is the goal.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux stated that on the chart two of the examples were new construction of single-family homes. She asked can a single family be built with an ADU. Is this really saying that only existing structures can have an ADU. Councillor Carlone stated that new construction would need to go for a variance. \n\nCity Solicitor Glowa stated that over the last several years there has been an interest in defining certain accessory units, as being somehow distinct from what otherwise would be considered a two-family. A two-family does not relate typically to a traditional zoning context or in most zoning cases that talk about zoning ordinances, it does not matter whether it is the same size as the larger units, or whether it is a so-called in-law unit or an accessory unit. She stated that if Residence A allows for 2 families then you can have an in-law unit in your large house. She added that these definitions have been shifting over the last few years as people have been working to create exceptions for or allowances for re-use of some aspects of building to accommodate these various types of accessory uses as part of existing structure. So, the basement unit change was one of the changes to differentiate between ADU and a two-family. This is confusing and could use clarification. She stated that a dwelling unit is a dwelling unit and whether it is called an ADU you are allowing another dwelling unit in a structure or if allowing another dwelling unit on a parcel such as a garage on a parcel this also is another dwelling unit. She added that this needs to be reconciled to make it more understandable to people.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan said it is important to have this conversation in the context of the overall zoning ordinance. He stated that he is highlighting this issue and if the zoning gets finer in the weeds of certain sections it gets more confusing and at some point, it makes sense to go back and look at the whole thing. He stated that if it makes sense to allow higher density of dwelling units whether it is an existing or new structure then maybe the entire zoning ordinance needs to be reviewed to get the same level of density everywhere. He spoke again about enforcement and if it complies with Building Code why do we have to get involved. He stated that there are better ways to accomplish these goals.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that he has been involved with this City for 45 years and 45 years ago it was said that the zoning code needed to be simplified and updated. He stated that having the Building Code be the basis is insufficient. The Zoning Code and the Building Code work together to create a safe and sensible city of buildings.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux stated that to make this clear she moved to amend 4.22.1 by adding after the words \u201calteration of\u201d the words \u201c\u201dan existing\u201d (ATTACHMENT E). Councillor Kelley stated that if this will make it read better to people and it is clearer it is a great idea.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that all zoning goes through Community Development and the Law Department and this is what is being asked for this petition. He stated that Mr. Roberts and Ms. Glowa have not had time to look at the current version and their input is needed. \n\nVice Mayor Devereux now moved her amendment- and on a voice vote of six members the amendment -\n\nCarried.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that given the timing of the petition this could be ordained by May 6th if submitted to the full City Council based on getting a refined and approved version from the City staff and the proposal could be moved to a second reading on April 22, 2019. \n\nCouncillor Carlone moved the petition as amended by substitution by Councillor Kelley and further amended by Vice Mayor Devereux be referred to the full City Council with a favorable recommendation based on getting a refined text from City staff. The motion carried on a voice vote of six members.\n\nCouncillor Carlone and Councillor Kelley thanked all those present for their attendance.\n\nThe hearing adjourned at 3:17 PM\n\nFor the Committee,\n\n__________________________________\n\nCouncillor Dennis J.

Carlone, Co-Chair Councillor Craig Kelley, Co-ChairVice Mayor Jan DevereuxCouncillor Alana M. Mallon Mayor Marc C. McGovernCouncillor Sumbul Siddiqui Councillor Timothy J. Toomey, Jr. Councillor E. Denise SimmonsCouncillor Quinton Y. Zondervan| In City Council April 8, 2019  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Ordinance Committee, comprised of the entire membership of the City Council, held a public hearing on March 27, 2019 at 3:03 PM in the Sullivan Chamber. \n\nThe purpose of the hearing was to discuss a zoning petition filed by Melissa and Christopher Grippo et al to amend the Zoning Ordinance by adding at the end of section 5.30.11 a sentence that reads: \u201cnotwithstanding the foregoing, in Industry B District, a hotel use (Section 4.31.2) shall be governed by the section number (4.0) for purposes of determining the maximum ratio of floor area to lot area (ATTACHMENT A).\n\nPresent at the hearing were Councillor Carlone Co-Chair of the Committee, \n\nCouncillor Mallon, Councillor Siddiqui, Councillor Zondervan, Arthur Goldberg, Deputy City Solicitor, Director of Zoning and Development Jeff Roberts, CDD and City Clerk Donna P. Lopez.\n\nAlso present were Attorney Patrick Barrett, Mark Boyes-Watson, Hassanaly Ladha, 34-40 Hampshire Street LLC and John Hawkinson.\n\nCouncillor Carlone convened the hearing and stated the purpose. He announced that the hearing was being audio and video recorded both publicly and privately. He outlined the format of the hearing. The petitioners would be heard first, followed by city staff and the Planning Board, then the City Council would discuss, followed by public comment and finally the City Council would conclude with a discussion.\n\nAttorney Patrick Barrett, representing the petitioners, gave a PowerPoint Presentation (ATTACHMENT B). He stated his presentation includes a parcel owned by Mr. Ladha in the IB district. He explained that the presentation would show what could possibly be built and what the intent is. In 2001 a citywide rezoning of the Industrial-B district hotel use was reduced to 2.75 FAR as a means to incentivize residential construction. Barrett noted that no residential building has occurred in this district in past 20 years. However, there have been three large commercial developments, all of which have been approved above the 4.0 FAR. He also noted a sub-area in IB allows a 3.2 FAR specifically for larger commercial buildings. \n\nMr. Barrett stated that the hotel use is still listed in the Table of Uses as a residential use, but it still cannot obtain the higher residential FAR of 4.0. He showed the area of the IB District before 2001 and after the rezoning of 2001. The petitioners own a lot in the district and want to build a small independent hotel. However, under the current FAR of 2.75 zoning this is extremely difficult. He stated that the up zoning petition received a favorable recommendation by the Planning Board. \n\nBarrett stated that residential development in this district is complicated given the large commercial/industrial buildings that surround it on three sides. Since the site also abuts the residential neighborhood, a hotel use is the best way to connect the two use areas. He informed the committee that he has met with the East Cambridge Business Association and with members of the community. He stated that One Kendall Square supports the plan because the hotel will bring an active use to this area. He stated that currently there is no active use in this area. He stated that there are 28 parcels in the IB district with parcels that are large in scale with a FAR of 4.0 or larger. He stated that because of a 2.75 FAR no one builds there. \n\nHe stated that there are 2,400 short-term rental units but only 212 are registered with ISD. He stated that short-term rentals use comprises 25% of what is deemed over-night stays in Cambridge. This proposed hotel use would draw out some Airbnb\u2019s that are not registered. He commented that the Watermark Building and the Third Street Apartment building are the biggest Airbnb locations, which are registered through Global Luxury Suites, which should not be a residence. These are being used as hotels and are not registered. He stated that the market for the proposed hotel is for this Airbnb market. His rates will be competitive and will have to do more to draw in the crowds.\n\nThere was an 84% hotel occupancy rate in 2018 and there are over 100 nights in Cambridge where every hotel room is booked. He noted that the demand is extraordinarily high. The average rate locally is $272 a night; national average is $110, including unregistered 2200 Airbnb\u2019s. He stated that this petition has been characterized as up-zoning. He prefers to think of it a restoration to a previous 4.0 FAR condition. \n\nThis is the perfect spot for this hotel use and for urban infill development. Three-dimensional renderings indicated that the grey zone is what could be built by right and the blue area is what the 4.0 FAR would add. This is lower than anything that is around it. He stated that Kendall Square is a great economic engine for the City but is not active or vibrant at night. \n\nThis type of hotel pays their employees more and draws employees from the neighborhood. This lot will get the architectural attention that it deserves. He stated that when the Central Square rezoning was addressed this same issue was addressed to activate the space. This is a small change in the zoning to a pre-existing condition. He stated that the Planning Board felt that this is the best way to go.\n\nCouncillor Carlone asked if the City Councillors had any clarification questions. None were offered. \n\nCouncillor Carlone asked how many square feet would be added to the proposal. Mr. Boyes-Watson responded that the petition adds two floors and each floor is 3,500 square feet. Councillor Carlone stated that the total building is approximately four times this. Mr. Boyes-Watson responded in the affirmative.\n\nCouncillor Carlone asked staff to come forward. \n\nMr. Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development, CDD, stated that the Planning Board reviewed this petition on February 26, 2019 and recommended adoption (ATTACHMENT C). This district is largely characterized with office and lab use and larger scale buildings. It is unlikely that there would be a significant change from this pattern except for a handful of small sites. He explained that the Planning Board felt that incentivizing hotel use on the site was appropriate for the district. \n\nCouncillor Carlone noted that residential use was basis for the downzoning in 2001 and asked what the Residential FAR currently is? Mr. Roberts stated that this district had a maximum FAR of 4.0 and under 2001 City-wide rezoning it was changed to allow for non-residential uses and changed to 2.75 FAR and for residential it remained at 4.0. He added that this can be increased if it is for inclusionary housing projects by 30%.\n\nCouncillor Carlone opened public comment.\n\nJohn Hawkinson stated that he had drafting comments that would make the proposed zoning ordinance clearer. He stated that there is a reference to section 4.31.2 in the ordinance which does not exist. He believes this is intended to refer to 4.31 (i) 2 which in turn refers to the Table of Uses referring to hotels. He wanted the City to amend the petition to reflect this. He stated that more substantively this section is at the beginning of the Table of Uses section of the ordinance and it refers to the Table which follows eleven pages later in Section 5.34 (entitled Industrial Districts). He stated that the table contains a footnote with an exception to those numbers. He added that it is a bad idea to put one exception in a footnote of the table and have another exception eleven pages later and that the exceptions should be together however they are handled. He stated that it is better that the change be consistent with the Zoning Ordinance already written and to revise footnote (e) of Table 5-4 in section 5.34 and to revise footnote (e) to include the language regarding hotels rather than putting it eleven pages earlier before the Table in a way that is different from how all other exceptions are handled. He requested that the City Councillor revise the ordinance regarding his comments so that it is clear and easy to read and understand. \n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that the city would depend on Cambridge\u2019s zoning expert to incorporate the suggested change and the Law Department to incorporate any overview change that is necessary. \n\nCouncillor Carlone opened discussion with the City Council.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan asked Mr. Roberts about Mr. Hawkinson\u2019s suggestions on whether it should or should not be considered. Mr. Roberts responded in the affirmative. He stated that it is true that the hotel uses listed in 4.31 (i) 2 rather than 4.31.2. He stated that generally when speaking of an exception the dimensional standards they are mostly listed in the footnotes of that Table. He stated that in this case for Industrial Districts it will be Table 5-4. He would also recommend that this is where this language should go. \n\nCouncillor Zondervan stated that he wanted to move the amendments. He stated that this would be an improvement over the current conditions. He asked what sustainability features could be included in the building. Mr. Boyes-Watson stated there is limited ability to generate any power on the site. The building will be as energy efficient as possible. He noted that the lot is only 6,000 square feet and is limited in what can be achieved. This lot faces northeast and he will work with the envelope to make this building as efficient as possible. Councillor Zondervan asked about living wage and providing jobs for Cambridge residents. Mr. Ladha responded that no one would be paid less than the living wage. It is their intention to meet or exceed the living wage and would maximize the capture of local residents as employees. Councillor Zondervan stated that residents from Newtowne Court and Washington Elms would appreciate jobs in the hotel.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that given the location, existing parking is tight and seeking local workers who could walk to work would be a benefit.\n\nCouncillor Siddiqui spoke about hospitality programs. She stated that Just-A-Start is thinking about starting such a program. She asked what the buildout timeline is. Mr. Boyes-Watson stated that based on completing this zoning process there would then be a planning and review process. Hopefully, construction would begin in the Spring of 2020 and will be eighteen months long.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that the site is tight and this could prolong the construction cycle. He added that the site is presently a whole in the urban block. He asked about the type of material that would be used for this project. Mr. Boyes-Watson stated that this building has the ability to restore the urban wall that creates the surrounding public space. There is a lot of frontage given the small parcel size. He added that more money could be spent on the facade because it has only one facade that faces out. He is hoping to use high quality materials and a fair amount of glazing. The adjacent brick building is dull, and the plan is stay away from brick but to add gravitas to the building with a masonry kind of feel with bay windows or a sense of a bay window. He stated that it is thought of as a building that speaks to being inhabited by people and has a patina or scale such as a classic European hotel. This is the design intent. He stated that it would do well to do a contrast and be an accent. He stated that this building could speak to One Kendall Square across the street. Councillor Carlone stated that the building abutting has a lower blank wall, and this proposal should be an embellishment. \n\nCouncillor Carlone asked if this size of building is subject to design review? Mr. Boyes-Watson stated that this project will go to the Planning Board and there will be a public hearing so that the neighborhood is involved with the project.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan now moved the amendments (ATTACHMENT D) - and on a voice vote the motion to amend -\n\nCarried on a voice vote of four members.\n\nCouncillor Carlone moved that the petition be referred to the full City Council with a favorable recommendation as amended - and on a voice vote the motion -\n\nCarried on a voice vote of four members.\n\nA communication was received from Jason Alves, Executive Director, East Cambridge Business Association, in support of the Grippo petition (ATTACHMENT E).\n\nCouncillor Carlone thanked all those present for their attendance.\n\nThe hearing adjourned at 3:36 PM\n\nFor the Committee,\n\n__________________________________\n\nCouncillor Dennis J.

He showed the area of the IB District before 2001 and after the rezoning of 2001. The petitioners own a lot in the district and want to build a small independent hotel. However, under the current FAR of 2.75 zoning this is extremely difficult. He stated that the up zoning petition received a favorable recommendation by the Planning Board. \n\nBarrett stated that residential development in this district is complicated given the large commercial/industrial buildings that surround it on three sides. Since the site also abuts the residential neighborhood, a hotel use is the best way to connect the two use areas. He informed the committee that he has met with the East Cambridge Business Association and with members of the community. He stated that One Kendall Square supports the plan because the hotel will bring an active use to this area. He stated that currently there is no active use in this area. He stated that there are 28 parcels in the IB district with parcels that are large in scale with a FAR of 4.0 or larger. He stated that because of a 2.75 FAR no one builds there. \n\nHe stated that there are 2,400 short-term rental units but only 212 are registered with ISD. He stated that short-term rentals use comprises 25% of what is deemed over-night stays in Cambridge. This proposed hotel use would draw out some Airbnb\u2019s that are not registered. He commented that the Watermark Building and the Third Street Apartment building are the biggest Airbnb locations, which are registered through Global Luxury Suites, which should not be a residence. These are being used as hotels and are not registered. He stated that the market for the proposed hotel is for this Airbnb market. His rates will be competitive and will have to do more to draw in the crowds.\n\nThere was an 84% hotel occupancy rate in 2018 and there are over 100 nights in Cambridge where every hotel room is booked. He noted that the demand is extraordinarily high. The average rate locally is $272 a night; national average is $110, including unregistered 2200 Airbnb\u2019s. He stated that this petition has been characterized as up-zoning. He prefers to think of it a restoration to a previous 4.0 FAR condition. \n\nThis is the perfect spot for this hotel use and for urban infill development. Three-dimensional renderings indicated that the grey zone is what could be built by right and the blue area is what the 4.0 FAR would add. This is lower than anything that is around it. He stated that Kendall Square is a great economic engine for the City but is not active or vibrant at night. \n\nThis type of hotel pays their employees more and draws employees from the neighborhood. This lot will get the architectural attention that it deserves. He stated that when the Central Square rezoning was addressed this same issue was addressed to activate the space. This is a small change in the zoning to a pre-existing condition. He stated that the Planning Board felt that this is the best way to go.\n\nCouncillor Carlone asked if the City Councillors had any clarification questions. None were offered. \n\nCouncillor Carlone asked how many square feet would be added to the proposal. Mr. Boyes-Watson responded that the petition adds two floors and each floor is 3,500 square feet. Councillor Carlone stated that the total building is approximately four times this. Mr. Boyes-Watson responded in the affirmative.\n\nCouncillor Carlone asked staff to come forward. \n\nMr. Roberts, Director of Zoning and Development, CDD, stated that the Planning Board reviewed this petition on February 26, 2019 and recommended adoption (ATTACHMENT C). This district is largely characterized with office and lab use and larger scale buildings. It is unlikely that there would be a significant change from this pattern except for a handful of small sites. He explained that the Planning Board felt that incentivizing hotel use on the site was appropriate for the district. \n\nCouncillor Carlone noted that residential use was basis for the downzoning in 2001 and asked what the Residential FAR currently is? Mr. Roberts stated that this district had a maximum FAR of 4.0 and under 2001 City-wide rezoning it was changed to allow for non-residential uses and changed to 2.75 FAR and for residential it remained at 4.0. He added that this can be increased if it is for inclusionary housing projects by 30%.\n\nCouncillor Carlone opened public comment.\n\nJohn Hawkinson stated that he had drafting comments that would make the proposed zoning ordinance clearer. He stated that there is a reference to section 4.31.2 in the ordinance which does not exist. He believes this is intended to refer to 4.31 (i) 2 which in turn refers to the Table of Uses referring to hotels. He wanted the City to amend the petition to reflect this. He stated that more substantively this section is at the beginning of the Table of Uses section of the ordinance and it refers to the Table which follows eleven pages later in Section 5.34 (entitled Industrial Districts). He stated that the table contains a footnote with an exception to those numbers. He added that it is a bad idea to put one exception in a footnote of the table and have another exception eleven pages later and that the exceptions should be together however they are handled. He stated that it is better that the change be consistent with the Zoning Ordinance already written and to revise footnote (e) of Table 5-4 in section 5.34 and to revise footnote (e) to include the language regarding hotels rather than putting it eleven pages earlier before the Table in a way that is different from how all other exceptions are handled. He requested that the City Councillor revise the ordinance regarding his comments so that it is clear and easy to read and understand. \n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that the city would depend on Cambridge\u2019s zoning expert to incorporate the suggested change and the Law Department to incorporate any overview change that is necessary. \n\nCouncillor Carlone opened discussion with the City Council.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan asked Mr. Roberts about Mr. Hawkinson\u2019s suggestions on whether it should or should not be considered. Mr. Roberts responded in the affirmative. He stated that it is true that the hotel uses listed in 4.31 (i) 2 rather than 4.31.2. He stated that generally when speaking of an exception the dimensional standards they are mostly listed in the footnotes of that Table. He stated that in this case for Industrial Districts it will be Table 5-4. He would also recommend that this is where this language should go. \n\nCouncillor Zondervan stated that he wanted to move the amendments. He stated that this would be an improvement over the current conditions. He asked what sustainability features could be included in the building. Mr. Boyes-Watson stated there is limited ability to generate any power on the site. The building will be as energy efficient as possible. He noted that the lot is only 6,000 square feet and is limited in what can be achieved. This lot faces northeast and he will work with the envelope to make this building as efficient as possible. Councillor Zondervan asked about living wage and providing jobs for Cambridge residents. Mr. Ladha responded that no one would be paid less than the living wage. It is their intention to meet or exceed the living wage and would maximize the capture of local residents as employees. Councillor Zondervan stated that residents from Newtowne Court and Washington Elms would appreciate jobs in the hotel.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that given the location, existing parking is tight and seeking local workers who could walk to work would be a benefit.\n\nCouncillor Siddiqui spoke about hospitality programs. She stated that Just-A-Start is thinking about starting such a program. She asked what the buildout timeline is. Mr. Boyes-Watson stated that based on completing this zoning process there would then be a planning and review process. Hopefully, construction would begin in the Spring of 2020 and will be eighteen months long.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that the site is tight and this could prolong the construction cycle. He added that the site is presently a whole in the urban block. He asked about the type of material that would be used for this project. Mr. Boyes-Watson stated that this building has the ability to restore the urban wall that creates the surrounding public space. There is a lot of frontage given the small parcel size. He added that more money could be spent on the facade because it has only one facade that faces out. He is hoping to use high quality materials and a fair amount of glazing. The adjacent brick building is dull, and the plan is stay away from brick but to add gravitas to the building with a masonry kind of feel with bay windows or a sense of a bay window. He stated that it is thought of as a building that speaks to being inhabited by people and has a patina or scale such as a classic European hotel. This is the design intent. He stated that it would do well to do a contrast and be an accent. He stated that this building could speak to One Kendall Square across the street. Councillor Carlone stated that the building abutting has a lower blank wall, and this proposal should be an embellishment. \n\nCouncillor Carlone asked if this size of building is subject to design review? Mr. Boyes-Watson stated that this project will go to the Planning Board and there will be a public hearing so that the neighborhood is involved with the project.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan now moved the amendments (ATTACHMENT D) - and on a voice vote the motion to amend -\n\nCarried on a voice vote of four members.\n\nCouncillor Carlone moved that the petition be referred to the full City Council with a favorable recommendation as amended - and on a voice vote the motion -\n\nCarried on a voice vote of four members.\n\nA communication was received from Jason Alves, Executive Director, East Cambridge Business Association, in support of the Grippo petition (ATTACHMENT E).\n\nCouncillor Carlone thanked all those present for their attendance.\n\nThe hearing adjourned at 3:36 PM\n\nFor the Committee,\n\n__________________________________\n\nCouncillor Dennis J.

Denise SimmonsCouncillor Quinton Zondervan| In City Council March 18, 2019  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Ordinance Committee, comprised of the entire membership of the City Council, held a public hearing on February 27, 2019 at 5:34 PM in the Sullivan Chamber. \n\nThe purpose of the hearing was to discuss a proposed amendment to the Municipal Code in Title Twelve entitled \u201cStreets, Sidewalks and Public Places\u201d by adding a new Chapter 12.22 entitled \u201cCycling Safety Ordinance\u201d (ATTACHMENT A).\n\nPresent at the hearing were: Councillor Carlone and Councillor Kelley, Co-Chairs of the Committee; Vice Mayor Devereux; Councillor Mallon; Mayor McGovern; Councillor Siddiqui; Councillor Toomey; Councillor Zondervan; Louis DePasquale, City Manager; Lisa Peterson, Deputy City Manager; Commissioner of Public Works, Owen O\u2019Riordan; Police Commissioner Branville Bard; Lieutenant Frederic Riley, Traffic Enforcement Unit, Police Department; Director of Transportation and Environmental Planning, CDD, Susanne Rasmussen; Cara Seiderman, Transportation Program Manager, CDD; Director of Transportation, Traffic and Parking Joseph Barr; City Solicitor Nancy Glowa; Will Durbin, Chief of Staff for Mayor McGovern; and City Clerk Donna P. Lopez.\n\nAlso present were: Sam Feigenbaum and Ruthann Rudel, Cambridge Bike Safety; George Schneeloch, 81 School Street, Somerville; Mark Boswell, 105 Walden Street; Randy Stern, 12 Kenwood Street; Kimberley Hunt, 18 10 Wendell Street; John Pitkin, 18 Fayette Street; Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler, 19 Trowbridge Street; Gavin Lund, 166 Charles Street; Annie Tuan, 129 Franklin Street; Yurij Lojko, 18 Lawrence Street, Medford; Eric Garrick, 6C Chester Street; Ted Feldman, 48 Gorham Street, Somerville; Itamar Turner-Traunig, 139 Oxford Street; Janie Katz-Christy, 166A Elm Street; Beth Wilson, Somerville; Nate Filmore, 13 Marcella Street and Ann Dinoto, Arlington. \n\nCouncillor Carlone convened the hearing and stated the purpose. He announced that the hearing was being audio and video recorded. He outlined the format of the hearing: petitioners, City staff, clarification questions by the City Council, public comment and then recommendations and next steps. \n\nMayor McGovern made introductory remarks. He thanked all those involved with the drafting of the Cycling Safety Ordinance. He thanked all who attended City Council meetings, speaking to make the streets safer, greener and healthier for all, including cyclists and pedestrians. He stated that he hoped that this ordinance will set expectations for use of the street spaces and how infrastructure work will occur. He noted that the ordinance establishes predictability for businesses and neighborhoods and insures that the installation of permanent bike lanes is part of a thoughtful process that considers the whole streetscape. He spoke about the benefits of the Western Avenue infrastructure improvements. He stated that Cambridge is capable of creating streets that work for all modes of transportation. He stated that the City has been discussing making streets safer for pedestrians and cyclists for a long time and there has been no shortage of research, studies and public comment, rallies and meetings, but there are still too many injuries and fatalities on the streets. He commented that he never wants to attend another \u201cghost bike\u201d memorial again. He added that talk and process alone will not create the network of safe bike infrastructure that is needed. He stated that the drafting of this ordinance was a team effort and represents reasonable compromise on both sides to bring Cambridge to a necessary place. \n\nAt this time Mr. Durbin introduced Cambridge Bike Safety volunteers Mr. Feigenbaum and Ruthann Rudel. Mr. Durbin stated that Cambridge Bicycle Safety will go over the purpose and goals. He stated that he will present the ordinance text. He stated that the City departments will discuss the process and implementation. He proceeded with the Presentation (ATTACHMENT B).\n\nRuthann Rudel discussed Cambridge Bike Safety\u2019s purpose and goals. She added that Cambridge enacted many bike infrastructure improvements, such as Vision Zero, the Vehicle Trip Reduction Ordinance, Growth Policy Document, the Climate Protection Plan and zoning changes. She stated that the City Council has goals for Healthy Community and the Environment and improving public safety. She stated that making it possible to bike safely in Cambridge is consistent with all of those policies. \n\nShe stated that redesigning roads to create safe space for cyclists is difficult to achieve; it is controversial to reallocate road space. She noted that this ordinance is intended to address some of the obstacles. She spoke about cycling accidents that have occurred trying to cycle around the City. She stated that Cambridge\u2019s data show that first responders are called to a crash involving a bike and motor vehicle once every three days. She spoke about the different levels of experience of cyclists and that the road needs to be made safer for cyclists to accommodate the different levels of experience. She stated that 60% of residents were interested in cycling, but are concerned about safety, and 81% preferred protected bike lanes as a way to move around the City. She stated that some active bicyclists are enthusiastic about protected bike lanes and some aren\u2019t. The protected bike lanes are built to make cycling comfortable for all ages and experience levels to get around the City safely. This is how there will be a sustainable mode shift. \n\nShe stated that the quick-build protected bike lane on Cambridge Street received a one-year report of data and bike crashes were reduced from 5 to 2. No pedestrian crashes were reported. Motor vehicle speed was reduced from 31 to 25 MPH. She also highlighted the benefits of the installation of the Western Avenue Cycle track. She stated that 40% of common crashes in Cambridge involve dooring and would be prevented by protected bike lanes.\n\nMr. Feigenbaum stated that the data for the Cambridge and Western Avenue bike lanes indicates that speed has been reduced. This is significant regarding whether a cyclist will survive from a crash with a motor vehicle. He added that an individual hit by a car traveling 40 MPH is more likely to die than a car traveling 20 MPH. He stated that with a network of protected bike lanes there will be less of a \u201cWild West\u201d mentality on the roads. Cyclists will behave more predictively because cyclists have a full network of reserved space. This relieves stress for all users. This also promotes transportation equity by reducing greenhouse gas and promotes good health.\n\nMr. Durbin spoke about the purpose statement from the ordinance. He spoke about the legislative background of the ordinance. Language was finalized in November and December and then introduced to the City Council. He reviewed the definitions. He stated that improvements do not include repairs to City streets. He stated that there are only two requirements. The first is when improvements are made to a City-owned street. Under the City\u2019s Street and Sidewalk Reconstruction Plan, the City Manager shall ensure improvements comply with the Cambridge Bicycle Plan or any superseding plan. If improvements are made to a segment of a separated network, a permanent separated bike lane with adequate directionality shall be installed along the segment. He added that there are two exceptions under Requirements B. He spoke about how the ordinance will be made effective and highlighted rare circumstances. \n\nAt this time City Staff gave a presentation (ATTACHMENT C). DPW Commissioner O\u2019Riordan gave a brief background of the Five-Year Sidewalk and Street Reconstruction Plan. This is included in the proposed ordinance, as it contains streets and sidewalks that the City anticipates repairing in five years. He stated that the program has been in place since 2007. He stated that the FY 2018 map shows the projected improvements to streets and large utility projects. The five-year plan promotes the Complete Streets philosophy and Vision Zero. He stated that Complete Streets are designed to be accessible for everyone. He stated that by the City Council adopted Complete Streets and Vision Zero, and since 2016 there has been more State funding received by the City. He stated that other policies and plans such as the Pedestrian Plan, Bike Plan, Transit Plan, Climate Change Plan, and Urban Forest are all developing plans for the streets. He stated that the Vehicle Trip Ordinance and Cambridge Growth Policy promote livability and improved air quality by reducing gas emissions. He spoke about ways to improve mobility. He stated that a Traffic Calming Program has been enacted for twenty years. The core goal of the Five-Year Plan was to look at accessibility across the City. He spoke about sidewalks and streets being more welcoming to all. He explained what the City looks at in terms the sidewalks being accessible. He explained the criteria taken into consideration when doing sidewalk reconstruction. He stated that the Bike Plan contains a framework for providing accessibility for Complete Streets across the City. He spoke about accessibility for people using public transit. He stated that the City infrastructure is improved to provide a more efficient and better experience for those who use public transit. He spoke about street trees and the City is considering more ways to plant trees in the public right of way to provide mitigation for urban heat island impact. He stated that the Five-Year Plan will be updated this year.\n\nMs. Suzanne Rasmussen spoke about the 2015 Bike Plan (ATTACHMENT D), which is the starting point for the ordinance. She stated that the Bike Plan will be updated. \n\nMs. Cara Seiderman stated that the Bike Plan was published in 2015 and the overall vision is for the City to have a Street Network that accommodates cycling as a mode of transportation for those of all ages and ability. She added that there are many other elements needed to support cycling in the Bike Plan, including bike parking, expanding the Bluebikes program and cycling classes. The Bike Plan is available online. She noted that the data is continually being reviewed to analyze volume, crashes and determine when more immediate action is needed. She explained the importance of bike comfort and safety for cyclists. Examples were provided to explain the bicycle level of comfort. There was map outlining the bicycle level of comfort. She spoke about what a separated bike lane would look like and that there are many ways to create a separated bike lane. The existing and planned network were reviewed with the major destinations and a network of streets that connected the major destinations together with a comfort level of the streets to determine what the best locations for separated bike lanes. She stated that the ordinance focuses on the purple on the map which are the more major street corridors. She stated that the full network contains all the elements. She stated that there will be a technical update in the revised Bike Plan and adding items to the toolbox and adding Vision Zero into the Bike Plan. There will be a feasibility assessment to add new sections to the Bike Plan update and an implementation plan. This will take about 18 months with a robust community process. \n\nMs. Rasmussen stated that there are exemptions in the ordinance. She spoke about physical features of the street that would prevent a protected bike facility to be installed, the usage of street and the financial constraints. \n\nCouncillor Toomey noted that the cycling safety ordinance does not include mandatory helmet requirements and proper lights on bikes at night. He questioned why was this omitted. Ms. Seiderman responded that there is a state and City law requiring lights at night. The City provides lights for free at all City events and advocacy groups help install lights on bikes. Bluebikes have built in lights. State law mandates the use of helmets for those 16 years of age and under. She added that these facilities are safer because they prevent crashes and a helmet will not prevent a crash. She stated that this is to prevent crashes from happening at all. Councillor Toomey stated that he wanted the Police Department to provide information on how many citations were issued for bikes without lights at night. \n\nCouncillor Kelley stated that more can be done than this ordinance. He expressed concern with the exceptions regarding physical features of the street, usage of the street and financial constraints. He stated that the ordinance seems constrained. He doesn\u2019t want the ordinance to make things worse for cyclists creating unsafe conditions. He asked if the City has the authority not to follow this ordinance from a financial implication that would make it worse for cyclists. Ms. Rasmussen stated that if the City Manager determined that this was not feasible it would be documented in a public report explaining why this was detrimental from the usage of the street perspective. Councillor Kelley stated that in 12.22.040 (B) he wanted to know that there is discretion for safety in the ordinance. Ms. Rasmussen stated that safety is paramount in all City street designs. \n\nVice Mayor Devereux asked if this will be part of the upcoming 18-month study to look at where these three exceptions can arise. Ms. Rasmussen stated that this is intended to last into the future. Ms. Seiderman stated physical features are easier to identify and less likely to change. She spoke about looking at the corridors and looking at the barriers. Mr. Feigenbaum stated that the compromise was to keep the exceptions definition open ended to give the City Manager adequate discretion when needed. She added that the rare circumstances language is to keep the exception truly a rarity and not becoming a standard operating procedure. Mr. Durbin stated that this was to tie the Cambridge Bike Plan and the Five-Year Construction Plan together.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan stated that Hampshire Street\u2019s vision plan included separated bike lanes, but they could not be installed without removing significant amounts of car storage. He asked if Hampshire Street were updated under the ordinance would separate bike lanes be installed. Ms. Rasmussen stated that these decisions are not being made now. She stated that in the future the demand for parking will decrease because of the use of autonomous vehicles that do not need to park along the street. She added that this is about looking at the network and connecting all the destinations and this has been the process to lay out the network. Councillor Zondervan commented that if the ordinance is in place the decision to add protected bike lanes on Hampshire Street will be made when the street is up for reconstruction. Ms. Rasmussen stated that the determination will be made at the time when the street is up for reconstruction.\n\nCouncillor Mallon compared the Bike Plan, the Five-Year Construction Plan and the bike network with key destinations and stated that it was helpful to see them all together. There is another map with what the existing network looks like. The Bike Plan will look at technical analysis and in 2020 when the Bike Plan is updated there will be an updated network plan that will take the place of the existing one. Ms. Seiderman stated that some of the things are in place now. Councillor Mallon asked will any construction for 2019-2020 have bike lanes. Mr. Barr stated that on the non-capital side there is intention to pursue the quick build strategy for bike lanes that will be used outside of the context of this ordinance and the Five-Year Plan. Councillor Mallon stated there are still quick builds planned before the Bike Plan is updated. Mr. Barr responded in the affirmative and the 5 Year Plan is the ultimate way to get this done. Mr. Feigenbaum stated that Cambridge Bike Safety sees this ordinance as a long-term plan. Councillor Mallon stated that she is happy to support the ordinance and the plans until the Bike Plan is updated. \n\nCouncillor Siddiqui asked for a point of clarification regarding the financial constraints and for this be explained. Ms. Rasmussen stated there are situations where it would be beyond typical reconstruction costs. She explained that if it were physically impossible to widen a street to install a separated facility, or it would require the City to take private land by eminent domain, which would be too costly are examples of such constraints. Councillor Siddiqui asked if the feasibility study would look at this. Ms. Rasmussen stated that the feasibility will be looking at this.\n\nMayor McGovern noted that this has taken collaboration on both sides. He stated that the exceptions are there because the City needs the exceptions. He stated that this is an ordinance about infrastructure. He stated that cyclists and motorists do not always follow the rules, and this is a behavioral issue. This is a commitment to build out the network.\n\nCouncillor Carlone opened public comment at 6: 45 PM.\n\nGeorge Schneelock, 81 School Street, Somerville, stated that Allison Donovan died in Somerville. He asked for faster implementation of Vision Zero measures in Somerville. He stated that signatures were submitted to Somerville and the next day Paula Shraga died in Boston. This fatality pushed Boston to bring up safety issues. He stated that safety issues should be addressed and not require advocacy. He supported the ordinance and rapid implementation is needed to build the separate lanes. He submitted his comments (ATTACHMENT E).\n\nMark Boswell, 105 Walden Street, spoke about supporting the ordinance as effective motivation to build out the network and would stand along with the Vehicle Trip Ordinance and ADA compliance. He submitted his comments (ATTACHMENT F).\n\nRandy Stern, 12 Kenwood Street, member of the Cambridge Bike Committee, stated he strongly supported the ordinance. This will empower the City staff around bike infrastructure and noted that every implementation is a tradeoff and facilities will be built. He stated that if this ordinance were in place there would be protected bike lanes on Huron Avenue.\n\nKimberly Hunt, 10 Wendell Street, stated her support for the ordinance for permanent protected bike lanes. She explained why she bikes. She stated that she is disabled and has cerebral palsy and has difficulty walking. She relies on public transit and her bike to get around. She stated that for her cycling is the best way to get around and allows her freedom. She stated that her commute along a protected route is the best part of her day. She spoke about her boyfriend who does not bike because of his fear of getting hit by a car. This ordinance will provide mobility and protected bike lanes will increase biking. She stated that protected bike lanes are the solution to get people out of their cars. She submitted her comments (ATTACHMENT G). \n\nJivan Sobrinho-Wheeler, 19 Trowbridge Street, stated that he is in favor of the ordinance. He spoke about the high cost of bike lights and helmets. He stated that issuing citations will not increase light and helmet use and will increase costs for low income residents, the majority of whom are black and brown residents. He spoke of an accident he had on his bike on Mt. Auburn Street. He stated that the 2014 plan had protected bike lanes for Mt. Auburn Street but has not occurred. He stated that adding protected bike lanes on Mt. Auburn Street will be an improvement. He spoke about multiple deaths for cyclists. He submitted his comments (ATTACHMENT H).\n\nGavin Lund, 166 Charles Street, stated his support for the ordinance and is encouraged by the dialogue. He appreciates the comments made by Mayor McGovern regarding behavior versus infrastructure. \n\nAnnie Tuan, 129 Franklin Street, stated that she is in favor of the cycling safety ordinance. She shared a story of someone who does not bike. The woman will not ride a bike on City streets because it is too scary. She added that building protected bike lanes will allow her friend to bike.\n\nYurok Loke, 18 Lawrence Street, Medford stated that he bikes to Cambridge every day where he works.

He stated that this is a good first step in the right direction for safety infrastructure. This is an environmental and equity issues. He stated that data shows that installing protected bike lanes reduces the stress of riders. He spoke about working with Somerville on improvements to Webster Avenue, which unfortunately is not part of the street improvement plan for Cambridge. He asked Cambridge to reconsider improvements to the Cambridge portion of Webster Avenue. The plan needs to be expanded and the data analyzed.\n\nItamar Turner-Turing, 130 Oxford Street, supported the ordinance and stated that the key issue is implementation. He stated that motorists will need more time to find parking and be upset about the bike lanes. He stated that biking is a low-income transportation and one year of biking is about what a motorist spends on their car for a month. \n\nJanie Katz-Christie, 166A Elm Street, runs Green Streets Initiative, a multi-modal monthly day of awareness about health and sustainable ways to get around. She stated that there are 4,000 - 5,000 participants per year. She stated that her organization promotes all types of car-light transportation.

Denise SimmonsCouncillor Quinton Zondervan| In City Council March 18, 2019  \n---|---  \n  \nThe Ordinance Committee, comprised of the entire membership of the City Council, held a public hearing on February 27, 2019 at 5:34 PM in the Sullivan Chamber. \n\nThe purpose of the hearing was to discuss a proposed amendment to the Municipal Code in Title Twelve entitled \u201cStreets, Sidewalks and Public Places\u201d by adding a new Chapter 12.22 entitled \u201cCycling Safety Ordinance\u201d (ATTACHMENT A).\n\nPresent at the hearing were: Councillor Carlone and Councillor Kelley, Co-Chairs of the Committee; Vice Mayor Devereux; Councillor Mallon; Mayor McGovern; Councillor Siddiqui; Councillor Toomey; Councillor Zondervan; Louis DePasquale, City Manager; Lisa Peterson, Deputy City Manager; Commissioner of Public Works, Owen O\u2019Riordan; Police Commissioner Branville Bard; Lieutenant Frederic Riley, Traffic Enforcement Unit, Police Department; Director of Transportation and Environmental Planning, CDD, Susanne Rasmussen; Cara Seiderman, Transportation Program Manager, CDD; Director of Transportation, Traffic and Parking Joseph Barr; City Solicitor Nancy Glowa; Will Durbin, Chief of Staff for Mayor McGovern; and City Clerk Donna P. Lopez.\n\nAlso present were: Sam Feigenbaum and Ruthann Rudel, Cambridge Bike Safety; George Schneeloch, 81 School Street, Somerville; Mark Boswell, 105 Walden Street; Randy Stern, 12 Kenwood Street; Kimberley Hunt, 18 10 Wendell Street; John Pitkin, 18 Fayette Street; Jivan Sobrinho-Wheeler, 19 Trowbridge Street; Gavin Lund, 166 Charles Street; Annie Tuan, 129 Franklin Street; Yurij Lojko, 18 Lawrence Street, Medford; Eric Garrick, 6C Chester Street; Ted Feldman, 48 Gorham Street, Somerville; Itamar Turner-Traunig, 139 Oxford Street; Janie Katz-Christy, 166A Elm Street; Beth Wilson, Somerville; Nate Filmore, 13 Marcella Street and Ann Dinoto, Arlington. \n\nCouncillor Carlone convened the hearing and stated the purpose. He announced that the hearing was being audio and video recorded. He outlined the format of the hearing: petitioners, City staff, clarification questions by the City Council, public comment and then recommendations and next steps. \n\nMayor McGovern made introductory remarks. He thanked all those involved with the drafting of the Cycling Safety Ordinance. He thanked all who attended City Council meetings, speaking to make the streets safer, greener and healthier for all, including cyclists and pedestrians. He stated that he hoped that this ordinance will set expectations for use of the street spaces and how infrastructure work will occur. He noted that the ordinance establishes predictability for businesses and neighborhoods and insures that the installation of permanent bike lanes is part of a thoughtful process that considers the whole streetscape. He spoke about the benefits of the Western Avenue infrastructure improvements. He stated that Cambridge is capable of creating streets that work for all modes of transportation. He stated that the City has been discussing making streets safer for pedestrians and cyclists for a long time and there has been no shortage of research, studies and public comment, rallies and meetings, but there are still too many injuries and fatalities on the streets. He commented that he never wants to attend another \u201cghost bike\u201d memorial again. He added that talk and process alone will not create the network of safe bike infrastructure that is needed. He stated that the drafting of this ordinance was a team effort and represents reasonable compromise on both sides to bring Cambridge to a necessary place. \n\nAt this time Mr. Durbin introduced Cambridge Bike Safety volunteers Mr. Feigenbaum and Ruthann Rudel. Mr. Durbin stated that Cambridge Bicycle Safety will go over the purpose and goals. He stated that he will present the ordinance text. He stated that the City departments will discuss the process and implementation. He proceeded with the Presentation (ATTACHMENT B).\n\nRuthann Rudel discussed Cambridge Bike Safety\u2019s purpose and goals. She added that Cambridge enacted many bike infrastructure improvements, such as Vision Zero, the Vehicle Trip Reduction Ordinance, Growth Policy Document, the Climate Protection Plan and zoning changes. She stated that the City Council has goals for Healthy Community and the Environment and improving public safety. She stated that making it possible to bike safely in Cambridge is consistent with all of those policies. \n\nShe stated that redesigning roads to create safe space for cyclists is difficult to achieve; it is controversial to reallocate road space. She noted that this ordinance is intended to address some of the obstacles. She spoke about cycling accidents that have occurred trying to cycle around the City. She stated that Cambridge\u2019s data show that first responders are called to a crash involving a bike and motor vehicle once every three days. She spoke about the different levels of experience of cyclists and that the road needs to be made safer for cyclists to accommodate the different levels of experience. She stated that 60% of residents were interested in cycling, but are concerned about safety, and 81% preferred protected bike lanes as a way to move around the City. She stated that some active bicyclists are enthusiastic about protected bike lanes and some aren\u2019t. The protected bike lanes are built to make cycling comfortable for all ages and experience levels to get around the City safely. This is how there will be a sustainable mode shift. \n\nShe stated that the quick-build protected bike lane on Cambridge Street received a one-year report of data and bike crashes were reduced from 5 to 2. No pedestrian crashes were reported. Motor vehicle speed was reduced from 31 to 25 MPH. She also highlighted the benefits of the installation of the Western Avenue Cycle track. She stated that 40% of common crashes in Cambridge involve dooring and would be prevented by protected bike lanes.\n\nMr. Feigenbaum stated that the data for the Cambridge and Western Avenue bike lanes indicates that speed has been reduced. This is significant regarding whether a cyclist will survive from a crash with a motor vehicle. He added that an individual hit by a car traveling 40 MPH is more likely to die than a car traveling 20 MPH. He stated that with a network of protected bike lanes there will be less of a \u201cWild West\u201d mentality on the roads. Cyclists will behave more predictively because cyclists have a full network of reserved space. This relieves stress for all users. This also promotes transportation equity by reducing greenhouse gas and promotes good health.\n\nMr. Durbin spoke about the purpose statement from the ordinance. He spoke about the legislative background of the ordinance. Language was finalized in November and December and then introduced to the City Council. He reviewed the definitions. He stated that improvements do not include repairs to City streets. He stated that there are only two requirements. The first is when improvements are made to a City-owned street. Under the City\u2019s Street and Sidewalk Reconstruction Plan, the City Manager shall ensure improvements comply with the Cambridge Bicycle Plan or any superseding plan. If improvements are made to a segment of a separated network, a permanent separated bike lane with adequate directionality shall be installed along the segment. He added that there are two exceptions under Requirements B. He spoke about how the ordinance will be made effective and highlighted rare circumstances. \n\nAt this time City Staff gave a presentation (ATTACHMENT C). DPW Commissioner O\u2019Riordan gave a brief background of the Five-Year Sidewalk and Street Reconstruction Plan. This is included in the proposed ordinance, as it contains streets and sidewalks that the City anticipates repairing in five years. He stated that the program has been in place since 2007. He stated that the FY 2018 map shows the projected improvements to streets and large utility projects. The five-year plan promotes the Complete Streets philosophy and Vision Zero. He stated that Complete Streets are designed to be accessible for everyone. He stated that by the City Council adopted Complete Streets and Vision Zero, and since 2016 there has been more State funding received by the City. He stated that other policies and plans such as the Pedestrian Plan, Bike Plan, Transit Plan, Climate Change Plan, and Urban Forest are all developing plans for the streets. He stated that the Vehicle Trip Ordinance and Cambridge Growth Policy promote livability and improved air quality by reducing gas emissions. He spoke about ways to improve mobility. He stated that a Traffic Calming Program has been enacted for twenty years. The core goal of the Five-Year Plan was to look at accessibility across the City. He spoke about sidewalks and streets being more welcoming to all. He explained what the City looks at in terms the sidewalks being accessible. He explained the criteria taken into consideration when doing sidewalk reconstruction. He stated that the Bike Plan contains a framework for providing accessibility for Complete Streets across the City. He spoke about accessibility for people using public transit. He stated that the City infrastructure is improved to provide a more efficient and better experience for those who use public transit. He spoke about street trees and the City is considering more ways to plant trees in the public right of way to provide mitigation for urban heat island impact. He stated that the Five-Year Plan will be updated this year.\n\nMs. Suzanne Rasmussen spoke about the 2015 Bike Plan (ATTACHMENT D), which is the starting point for the ordinance. She stated that the Bike Plan will be updated. \n\nMs. Cara Seiderman stated that the Bike Plan was published in 2015 and the overall vision is for the City to have a Street Network that accommodates cycling as a mode of transportation for those of all ages and ability. She added that there are many other elements needed to support cycling in the Bike Plan, including bike parking, expanding the Bluebikes program and cycling classes. The Bike Plan is available online. She noted that the data is continually being reviewed to analyze volume, crashes and determine when more immediate action is needed. She explained the importance of bike comfort and safety for cyclists. Examples were provided to explain the bicycle level of comfort. There was map outlining the bicycle level of comfort. She spoke about what a separated bike lane would look like and that there are many ways to create a separated bike lane. The existing and planned network were reviewed with the major destinations and a network of streets that connected the major destinations together with a comfort level of the streets to determine what the best locations for separated bike lanes. She stated that the ordinance focuses on the purple on the map which are the more major street corridors. She stated that the full network contains all the elements. She stated that there will be a technical update in the revised Bike Plan and adding items to the toolbox and adding Vision Zero into the Bike Plan. There will be a feasibility assessment to add new sections to the Bike Plan update and an implementation plan. This will take about 18 months with a robust community process. \n\nMs. Rasmussen stated that there are exemptions in the ordinance. She spoke about physical features of the street that would prevent a protected bike facility to be installed, the usage of street and the financial constraints. \n\nCouncillor Toomey noted that the cycling safety ordinance does not include mandatory helmet requirements and proper lights on bikes at night. He questioned why was this omitted. Ms. Seiderman responded that there is a state and City law requiring lights at night. The City provides lights for free at all City events and advocacy groups help install lights on bikes. Bluebikes have built in lights. State law mandates the use of helmets for those 16 years of age and under. She added that these facilities are safer because they prevent crashes and a helmet will not prevent a crash. She stated that this is to prevent crashes from happening at all. Councillor Toomey stated that he wanted the Police Department to provide information on how many citations were issued for bikes without lights at night. \n\nCouncillor Kelley stated that more can be done than this ordinance. He expressed concern with the exceptions regarding physical features of the street, usage of the street and financial constraints. He stated that the ordinance seems constrained. He doesn\u2019t want the ordinance to make things worse for cyclists creating unsafe conditions. He asked if the City has the authority not to follow this ordinance from a financial implication that would make it worse for cyclists. Ms. Rasmussen stated that if the City Manager determined that this was not feasible it would be documented in a public report explaining why this was detrimental from the usage of the street perspective. Councillor Kelley stated that in 12.22.040 (B) he wanted to know that there is discretion for safety in the ordinance. Ms. Rasmussen stated that safety is paramount in all City street designs. \n\nVice Mayor Devereux asked if this will be part of the upcoming 18-month study to look at where these three exceptions can arise. Ms. Rasmussen stated that this is intended to last into the future. Ms. Seiderman stated physical features are easier to identify and less likely to change. She spoke about looking at the corridors and looking at the barriers. Mr. Feigenbaum stated that the compromise was to keep the exceptions definition open ended to give the City Manager adequate discretion when needed. She added that the rare circumstances language is to keep the exception truly a rarity and not becoming a standard operating procedure. Mr. Durbin stated that this was to tie the Cambridge Bike Plan and the Five-Year Construction Plan together.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan stated that Hampshire Street\u2019s vision plan included separated bike lanes, but they could not be installed without removing significant amounts of car storage. He asked if Hampshire Street were updated under the ordinance would separate bike lanes be installed. Ms. Rasmussen stated that these decisions are not being made now. She stated that in the future the demand for parking will decrease because of the use of autonomous vehicles that do not need to park along the street. She added that this is about looking at the network and connecting all the destinations and this has been the process to lay out the network. Councillor Zondervan commented that if the ordinance is in place the decision to add protected bike lanes on Hampshire Street will be made when the street is up for reconstruction. Ms. Rasmussen stated that the determination will be made at the time when the street is up for reconstruction.\n\nCouncillor Mallon compared the Bike Plan, the Five-Year Construction Plan and the bike network with key destinations and stated that it was helpful to see them all together. There is another map with what the existing network looks like. The Bike Plan will look at technical analysis and in 2020 when the Bike Plan is updated there will be an updated network plan that will take the place of the existing one. Ms. Seiderman stated that some of the things are in place now. Councillor Mallon asked will any construction for 2019-2020 have bike lanes. Mr. Barr stated that on the non-capital side there is intention to pursue the quick build strategy for bike lanes that will be used outside of the context of this ordinance and the Five-Year Plan. Councillor Mallon stated there are still quick builds planned before the Bike Plan is updated. Mr. Barr responded in the affirmative and the 5 Year Plan is the ultimate way to get this done. Mr. Feigenbaum stated that Cambridge Bike Safety sees this ordinance as a long-term plan. Councillor Mallon stated that she is happy to support the ordinance and the plans until the Bike Plan is updated. \n\nCouncillor Siddiqui asked for a point of clarification regarding the financial constraints and for this be explained. Ms. Rasmussen stated there are situations where it would be beyond typical reconstruction costs. She explained that if it were physically impossible to widen a street to install a separated facility, or it would require the City to take private land by eminent domain, which would be too costly are examples of such constraints. Councillor Siddiqui asked if the feasibility study would look at this. Ms. Rasmussen stated that the feasibility will be looking at this.\n\nMayor McGovern noted that this has taken collaboration on both sides. He stated that the exceptions are there because the City needs the exceptions. He stated that this is an ordinance about infrastructure. He stated that cyclists and motorists do not always follow the rules, and this is a behavioral issue. This is a commitment to build out the network.\n\nCouncillor Carlone opened public comment at 6: 45 PM.\n\nGeorge Schneelock, 81 School Street, Somerville, stated that Allison Donovan died in Somerville. He asked for faster implementation of Vision Zero measures in Somerville. He stated that signatures were submitted to Somerville and the next day Paula Shraga died in Boston. This fatality pushed Boston to bring up safety issues. He stated that safety issues should be addressed and not require advocacy. He supported the ordinance and rapid implementation is needed to build the separate lanes. He submitted his comments (ATTACHMENT E).\n\nMark Boswell, 105 Walden Street, spoke about supporting the ordinance as effective motivation to build out the network and would stand along with the Vehicle Trip Ordinance and ADA compliance. He submitted his comments (ATTACHMENT F).\n\nRandy Stern, 12 Kenwood Street, member of the Cambridge Bike Committee, stated he strongly supported the ordinance. This will empower the City staff around bike infrastructure and noted that every implementation is a tradeoff and facilities will be built. He stated that if this ordinance were in place there would be protected bike lanes on Huron Avenue.\n\nKimberly Hunt, 10 Wendell Street, stated her support for the ordinance for permanent protected bike lanes. She explained why she bikes. She stated that she is disabled and has cerebral palsy and has difficulty walking. She relies on public transit and her bike to get around. She stated that for her cycling is the best way to get around and allows her freedom. She stated that her commute along a protected route is the best part of her day. She spoke about her boyfriend who does not bike because of his fear of getting hit by a car. This ordinance will provide mobility and protected bike lanes will increase biking. She stated that protected bike lanes are the solution to get people out of their cars. She submitted her comments (ATTACHMENT G). \n\nJivan Sobrinho-Wheeler, 19 Trowbridge Street, stated that he is in favor of the ordinance. He spoke about the high cost of bike lights and helmets. He stated that issuing citations will not increase light and helmet use and will increase costs for low income residents, the majority of whom are black and brown residents. He spoke of an accident he had on his bike on Mt. Auburn Street. He stated that the 2014 plan had protected bike lanes for Mt. Auburn Street but has not occurred. He stated that adding protected bike lanes on Mt. Auburn Street will be an improvement. He spoke about multiple deaths for cyclists. He submitted his comments (ATTACHMENT H).\n\nGavin Lund, 166 Charles Street, stated his support for the ordinance and is encouraged by the dialogue. He appreciates the comments made by Mayor McGovern regarding behavior versus infrastructure. \n\nAnnie Tuan, 129 Franklin Street, stated that she is in favor of the cycling safety ordinance. She shared a story of someone who does not bike. The woman will not ride a bike on City streets because it is too scary. She added that building protected bike lanes will allow her friend to bike.\n\nYurok Loke, 18 Lawrence Street, Medford stated that he bikes to Cambridge every day where he works. He stated that about 8 months ago he had an accident with an 18-wheeler and spent time in the hospital. He spoke about the recent fatal death in Somerville.

He spoke about the speeding on a one-lane side street, Orchid Street.\n\nTed Feldman, 48 Gorham Street, Somerville, stated that he is a member of the Somerville Bicycle Advisory Committee. He stated that this is a good first step in the right direction for safety infrastructure. This is an environmental and equity issues. He stated that data shows that installing protected bike lanes reduces the stress of riders. He spoke about working with Somerville on improvements to Webster Avenue, which unfortunately is not part of the street improvement plan for Cambridge. He asked Cambridge to reconsider improvements to the Cambridge portion of Webster Avenue. The plan needs to be expanded and the data analyzed.\n\nItamar Turner-Turing, 130 Oxford Street, supported the ordinance and stated that the key issue is implementation. He stated that motorists will need more time to find parking and be upset about the bike lanes. He stated that biking is a low-income transportation and one year of biking is about what a motorist spends on their car for a month. \n\nJanie Katz-Christie, 166A Elm Street, runs Green Streets Initiative, a multi-modal monthly day of awareness about health and sustainable ways to get around. She stated that there are 4,000 - 5,000 participants per year. She stated that her organization promotes all types of car-light transportation. She stated that she goes out of her way to travel on protective bike lanes. She stated that cyclists have a right to be in the \u201clane\u201d. The law has not been clarified as to who belongs in the lane. It is unfair to be killed riding a bike. \n\nBecca Wolfson, Director, Boston Cyclist Union, 114 School Street, Somerville stated that she bikes from Somerville to Roxbury every day.

Since the legislation was enacted, many public entities have successfully applied for, and are using the CMaR Method.   \n  \nThe Office of the Inspector General has promulgated a set of procedures for using the CMaR Method. Once a public agency or municipality\u2019s (hereafter \u201cMunicipality\u201d) governing body authorizes the use of the CMaR Method, the Municipality submits an application to the IG, from whom the Municipality\u2019s awarding authority must obtain a notice to proceed in order to use the CMaR Method. The application requires that the Municipality demonstrate the following:\n\na: The Municipality has authorization from its governing body to enter into a contract with a CMaR firm. \n\nb: The Municipality has the capacity and a plan and procedure that is in place and approved of by the governing body, where appropriate, to effectively procure and manage CMaR services for the specific project and has retained the services of a qualified owner\u2019s project manager. \n\nc: The Municipality has procedures in place to ensure fairness in competition, evaluation and reporting of results at every stage in the procurement process. \n\nd: The building project has an estimated construction value of $5,000,000.00 or more.\n\ne: The Municipality has determined that the use of the CMaR Method is appropriate for the building project and states the reasons in writing for the determination. \n\nThis memorandum is intended to summarize the definition, advantages, and process governing the use of the CMaR Method in support of my seeking City Council approval to utilize this construction method for the Project. My submission to you of this memorandum is the first step in satisfying the above referenced requirements for seeking approval to use the CMaR Method for the Tobin Montessori and Vassal Lane Upper Schools Project and will answer the following questions:\n\n\u00b7 What is CMaR?\n\n\u00b7 What procurement and construction methods has the City used for vertical construction projects in the past?\n\n\u00b7 What are some of the benefits and risks of using the CMaR Method?\n\n\u00b7 What is the timeline for the CMaR Method?\n\nWhat is Construction Management at Risk (CMaR)?\n\nThe CMaR is selected through a competitive procurement based on qualifications and price. The City will procure the CMaR via a two-step Request For Qualifications (\u201cRFQ\u201d) and Request For Proposal (\u201cRFP\u201d) process.\n\nThe type of contract the City will enter into with the CMaR is a cost-plus fixed fee amount with a Guaranteed Maximum Price (\u201cGMP\u201d). The GMP is the sum of the CMaR fee, and the costs associated with the CMaR\u2019s general conditions for construction, all of the filed sub bid trade contractors, the CMaR estimates for any un-bid subcontractors at the time of the establishment of the GMP and includes the CMaR\u2019s contingency. The CMaR agrees to pay for costs that exceed the GMP that are not the result of changes in the contract documents. This is one of the reasons a CMaR is selected prior to the plans and specifications being completed. The CMaR works with the owner and the architect to develop the scope delineated in the contract documents as part of the team.\n\nThe fixed fee is a percentage of the cost of the work and is submitted by the CMaR during the selection process based upon an estimated cost of construction. The CMaR\u2019s contingency belongs to the CMaR if it is needed but is turned over to the City if not used. The contingency is a line item within the GMP and is used to incorporate missing items undefined at the time the GMP is established that arise during the project. \n\nBy law, the GMP cannot be established until the drawings and specifications are at a minimum of 60% complete. The closer the documents are to being 100% complete, the less the CMaR\u2019s contingency line item is. The Owner\u2019s contingency is for owner-directed changes or unforeseen conditions unknown at the time the GMP is established. The CMaR\u2019s contingency is included in the GMP; the owner\u2019s contingency is outside of the GMP. \n\nThe City Manager\u2019s project management staff will work closely with the City\u2019s Architect, consultants and CMaR to determine the appropriate contingencies. \n\nWhat procurement and construction methods has the City used for vertical construction projects in the past?\n\nThe City has used M.G.L. c. 149 and the M.G.L. c. 149A delivery process in the past for bidding vertical construction. This process, also defined as \u201cdesign-bid-build\u201d, requires all of the construction bid packages to be available only after 100% completion of the design documents. Under this traditional approach, the lowest responsible and eligible bidder is awarded the project. \n\nThe City has previously been approved by the IG to use the CMaR Method for the 5 Western Avenue project, the Dr. Martin Luther King School on Putnam Avenue, the King Open/Cambridge Street Upper School and Community Complex, the Foundry project, and the Multi-Department Relocation Plan which was recently approved by the Inspector General. \n\nWhat are some of the pros and cons of using the CMaR method?\n\nPros:\n\n\u00b7 The selection of the CMaR through an RFQ process allows the City to better define the specific requirements the City is looking for in a CMaR firm. The submission of defined company qualifications the presentation of these qualifications by the CMaR team to a selection committee allows for a better interaction of questions and answers to best determine the most qualified CMaR for the project.\n\n\u00b7 The selection is based upon qualifications and experience relative to specific City requirements, not the lowest price. The CMaR is selected, rather than awarded due to the lowest bid. The working relationship between the CMaR, the Owner and the architect is enhanced due to a working relationship that is developed during the process leading up to the establishment of the GMP. \n\n\u00b7 The CMaR is directly involved with the selection and management of the scope of work for the filed sub-bid trades. Because the CMaR takes the lead in defining the peripheral scope of work for staging, lifts, temporary lighting, miscellaneous patching, fire stopping, etc., scope of work disputes (a cost to the owner if they have merit) are minimized and this coordination places responsibility directly with the CMaR as the responsible party for defining each sub-bidders\u2019 drawings and specifications.\n\n\u00b7 The CMaR provides pre-construction services, which aids the City\u2019s project team with scheduling, budgeting, value engineering, phasing strategies, and constructability reviews.\n\n\u00b7 With the CMaR Method, early bid packages for demolition and abatement of hazardous materials can run concurrently while the project design is being finalized. \n\n\u00b7 The potential for change orders that occur as the result of gaps in the scopes of work as defined by the Architect is reduced because the CMaR is participating in the delineation of the scope of work during the pre-construction services. \n\n\u00b7 If the City and the selected CMaR do not come to an agreement as to the GMP, then the City has the option of bidding the project.\n\nCons:\n\n\u00b7 The CMaR Method reduces the risk for the CMaR contractor as he/she is involved early in the schematic design process. The CMaR\u2019s risk is mitigated by his/her early involvement during the design phase and his/her contingency that is established as part of the GMP. \n\n\u00b7 The CMaR Method reduces conflict risk between the City and the CMaR firm but that risk is minimized with an overall increased cost at the time the GMP is established.\n\nWhat is the timeline for the CMaR Method?\n\nThe first step is the CMaR Method is submission of an application to the IG. The IG\u2019s response for approval or denial of the application is due in 60 days.\n\nSubmission in April 2019 would place the IG approval in June 2019. This coincides with Feasibility Study being prepared by Perkin Eastman, Inc. the Feasibility Study is scheduled to be submitted to the City in October 2019. \n\nGetting the CMaR under contract for the pre-con services will help provide critical information as to site logistics and how to best handle the variety of options available to remediate any soil issues on this site. \n\nI look forward to answering any questions you may have about the application and the CMAR Method that we propose to use for this Project.\n", "full_text": " A communication transmitted from Louis A.

Alexander, 4 Crawford Street.\n\nCouncillor Kelley convened the hearing and stated the purpose. He announced that the hearing was being audio and video recorded. He highlighted the format of the hearing.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan gave a PowerPoint Presentation (ATTACHMENT B). He stated that the current Tree Protection Ordinance was adopted in 2004 but it does not protect trees. It applies to a limited part of the canopy. It applies to large projects that need to undergo large project reviews. This is for 25,000 square feet or above projects and does not pertain to affordable housing projects. The current ordinance is retroactive to one year prior to a special permit application. If an individual were to cut down trees two years ago and then apply for a special permit on the property these trees would not be covered under the ordinance. Only trees cut down within one year of applying for a special permit are covered. This applies to trees over eight inches in diameter at chest height. He stated that the ordinance has a replacement plan which allows for a payment, based on a variety of conditions, to be made into the Tree Fund instead of replanting trees or not cutting them down in the first place. He stated that the ordinance does not cover any trees cut down outside of large project review projects, any tree cut down more than one year prior to a special permit application and affordable housing projects. He outlined the proposed amendment. He explained that the amendment would preserve the affordable housing exemption. The ordinance also exempts dangerous and emergency situations. He stated that the amendment does require a permit for significant trees more than eight inches that are removed and are not part of a large project review, in which case they would already be covered, or if removed more than one year ago. He stated that the permit would be issued by Public Works and would be discretionary and would document why the tree was cut down and the specifics pertaining to the tree being cut down. He commented that no one cuts down their own large trees. A contractor is hired. He stated that the City would inform the contractors that a permit is required and that would help compliance. Contractors can obtain permits on behalf of the property owner. He explained why this proposed amendment is needed now. He stated that 18% of the tree canopy has been lost in the last 9 years based on preliminary data. He stated that the current data shows that the loss is worse, and the task force analysis is showing that there will be more loss in the future. He stated that the two solutions to the problem are to stop cutting down trees and to plant more trees. He acknowledged the work of Urban Forest Tree Task Force and noted that the Task Force will be making recommendations in the future. \n\nVice Mayor Devereux asked why this did not include Wheeler Street. Councillor Zondervan responded because it has inclusionary housing units. Vice Mayor Devereux stated that to her affordable housing does not include inclusionary housing. This does not apply to Wheeler Street and does apply to Millers River.\n\nCouncillor Kelley stated that the copy of the ordinance he is looking at does not have a retroactive date of one year. Councillor Zondervan stated that this is in the current ordinance. Councillor Kelley stated that it would be a retroactive hearing for trees that have already been cut down. He stated that there would be a violation of cutting down trees within one year of the special permit application.\n\nCommissioner O\u2019Riordan stated that the existing ordinance applies to large projects and there is nothing at this time regarding tree removal private property in the City that is not associated with a large project. This does place a burden on the staff with this new amendment and he asked how this ordinance will be enforced and if a tree is removed without a permit how is this handled by the City. When legislation has been enacted such as plastic bags or polystyrene there has been significant outreach and education programs prior to promulgating the ordinance. He stated that it is custom that the City provides notice and educational documents before implementing a change in regulations. He stated that his concern is that this is going to take time for the City to do this. He stated that the Urban Forestry Masterplan has been ongoing for the last eight months and it will be a while before the report will be ready for consideration by the City Council. He stated that the integrity of this work needs to be maintained and shared thoughts about changes to existing ordinances while this work is on-going so that the City Council can be provided with a thorough analysis of what other communities are doing, how best the City can provide different ordinances and/or regulations so as to better protect the tree canopy. He wanted to make the City Council cognizant of the Task Force\u2019s work as the Council considers changes to the existing ordinance. \n\nCouncillor Mallon asked has there been any preliminary discussion with the Urban Forestry Task Force on this issue. She stated that the draft recommendations will be done in May. She stated that the goal of this ordinance is to collect data and to have conversations around alternatives. Commissioner O\u2019Riordan stated that the first few months of the task force was providing background on the existing urban tree canopy, the loss and where the loss is most pronounced. He stated that the loss is most pronounced in residential areas in the City. He stated that the reason for the loss is uncertain at this time. He stated that that are reviewing closer the loss in residential areas and are looking at the degree to which pervious areas have been lost. He stated that this may be related to redevelopment or extended development on residential properties. He stated that the City is also looking at house sales and whether properties have been redeveloped where trees have been removed as a result of development. He stated that in terms of changing ordinance and regulations and a meeting held in December looked at changing the definition of significant tree. He stated that presently a significant tree is an eight-inch tree. He stated that they are looking at a six-inch tree being a significant tree, and this is consistent with what other communities are doing. He stated that they are looking at regulating tree loss across the entire City, looking at changing the way that mitigation costs are proposed and looking a mitigation when significant trees are cut down and diameter of trees at breast height and the area of a tree trunk at breast height. He stated that tree species are being reviewed. He stated that there is details that are been reviewed as to how to protect trees in the community. He stated that it is important to let this conversation continue. He spoke about the more significant protections for trees the more onerous it become for homeowners to take down trees. He added people may be less likely to plant trees in the future as well. He stated that there is a balance needed in incentivizing planting trees on private property. He spoke about protecting people\u2019s ownership of property and rights of homeowners to protect their property. He noted that there are five more meetings scheduled. \n\nCouncillor Mallon stated that in May when the draft recommendations from Urban Forestry Task Force come out will there be something that the City Council can work with from that that addresses the issues outlined by the Commissioner of Public Works or does the City Council have to wait for the final recommendations in December. She asked if this ordinance does not get passed is there a way to have the data collected between now and May. Commissioner O\u2019Riordan stated that all the presentations, minutes and correspondence from the public are on line on the Public Works page. He stated that the expectation is that the draft report will also be on line. The draft report may contain specific recommendations or may be more general. He stated that the report will be detailed. He is unsure about the successfulness of the data collection. He stated that the University of Vermont is working with the City on this and they did the 2009 and 2014 studies and they have been asked to look at the current 2018 study for consistency of the analysis.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that the proposed ordinance changes are benign. There is nothing in this proposal that is threatening. He suggested sending out postcards and noted that word of mouth travels fast. Awaiting the recommendations in May and what might be possibly ordained in September at the earliest, this proposal is not a terrible thing to have on the books and may not be enforced immediately, isn\u2019t this a good start to let people know that there is a concern. Commissioner O\u2019Riordan stated that it is benign from the perspective of the homeowner. He expressed his concern about enforcement and it is an onerous undertaking from the City\u2019s perspective. The amendment speaks to emergency circumstances and this is not defined in this proposal and asked what is considered an emergency. He spoke about the one-year period of time is defined for significant trees, larger than eight inches. He stated that he does not think the proposed amendment is applicable for a special permit unless there is a change in the definition of a significant tree. Councillor Carlone spoke about making the language stronger and clearer. Commissioner O\u2019Riordan stated that if one is to remove any reference to a period of time does this mean that a property that lost a tree ten years ago would have to have this mitigated to develop their property now.\n\nCouncillor Siddiqui spoke about urgency and competing with a process and how is this balanced. There are policy strategies could be considered now or do we or can we wait. She stated that she is struggling with this with that data before the City, the tree canopy loss and climate change. \n\nVice Mayor Devereux stated that we have already waited; this conversation began early last term. She stated that the City Council was prodded to start this Urban Forestry Task Force, and this took six months to get this going. She stated that there is no penalty in this ordinance. She spoke about the concern with enforcement and used the example of Airbnb which the City is having trouble enforcing. She stated that this interferes with the work of the Urban Forestry Task Force and that the City Council acknowledges the urgency of their works and want to support them. She added that all this is doing is gathering data and it is not imposing any fines and does no more than allow the arborist to have a conversation to suggest an alternative to the property owner. The longer before these conversations occur, the more trees will be cut down. She wanted this proposal approved.\n\nDeputy City Solicitor Goldberg stated that the enforcement provisions existing in the ordinance would apply to this amended provision. He stated that the existing enforcement provisions mention a stop work order if tree are removed in violation of the chapter and there could be penalties imposed. \n\nCouncillor Zondervan agreed emergency circumstance are not defined and this is on purpose to give this discretion to the arborist to determine if an emergency exists. He would be fine adopting this as is and that this does not apply to any trees more than one year. He stated that he does not believe that this is retroactive from ordination and would not apply to trees cut down ten years ago.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux asked why this is worded makes trees not subject to the current ordinance and if included as proposed a permit request why the other enforcement mechanism apply. Deputy City Solicitor Goldberg stated that he is not sure that the tree replacement fund provisions would apply to the mitigation plan. He stated that the enforcement section, 8.66.090, applies to enforcement remedies, including a stop work order, fines of $300 per violation, the possibility of injunctive relief and alternative penalties for non-criminal penalty. Councillor Zondervan stated that subsection D does specifically reference the large project and it does not apply. Deputy City Solicitor Goldberg agreed. Vice Mayor Devereux spoke about Councillor Zondervan\u2019s intent when drafting the proposed amendment. She stated that the City Council can state that enforcement does not apply to this other type of tree. Deputy City Solicitor Goldberg stated that the ordinance could be written this way but if there is no enforcement provision there is no incentive to comply with the ordinance. If there is no compliance, there is no penalty for compliance. This is an ordinance without any teeth. The way the amendment is written and if this section is being added in it is being put in the context of the ordinance and it does have the enforcement provision. Vice Mayor Devereux stated that a different approach to enforcement could be suggested. She stated that a mechanism could be developed that would make the contractor responsible, such as leaf blower ordinance. \n\nCouncillor Kelley stated that if the concern is about retroactivity he suggested language at the end: This section is only applicable to trees standing as of enactment of this section. He stated that if someone is cutting down trees not related to a project this is not included in the ordinance. He asked if this is the intent. Councillor Zondervan stated that this states procedures for other projects and the language could be changed to all projects or significant trees. He stated that the intent is that this new section would apply everywhere where the current section does not. \n\nAt 6:16 PM Councillor Kelley opened the hearing to public comment.\n\nLucas James Gyrator, 225 Brookline Street, spoke about the proposal by Councillor Zondervan for tree protection. He requested the inclusion and consideration of the following knowledge and guidelines. He requested that all trees in the City of Cambridge are completely protected by the City\u2019s systematic processes of protection. He requested that the protection apply to all trees on public, private, commercial, state and City properties and preservations. He requested that the implementation of this protection be effective to all trees of any kind. He requested that trees be protected especially on private land. He stated that trees of this City are beings of this earth and are to be respected for their life and being. They provide oxygen and are the reason we are currently breathing. Trees filter the air and contribute to the eco-system of all planetary life. He noted that trees are not owned by the City or its people even though they may grow on illegally owned land or the land of private owners or in public space. He stated that the concept of the ownership of a tree is out of the hands of any one person and thus trees do not fall under the ownership of people at all. He submitted his comments (ATTACHMENT C).\n\nChristine Kuta, 7 Fairview Avenue, stated that the permitting process is a burden on the private land owner. She stated that she has a tiny house on a small lot of land and it is difficult to maintain. She stated that going through what seems a benign process of a permit is another thing she has to deal with to get anything done on her land and it is also a burden on the arborist. She noted that when the street trees around her house needed to be trimmed it took a year to get this done. She stated that currently there is a public dead tree across the street and has not been taken down since last year. The Public Works Department is overburdened. She was not in favor of the permitting to add more work no matter how benign this is. She stated that she does care about the tree canopy of the City but disagrees with this new policy that is based on maintaining the status quo. Climate change is here, and the trees planted years ago were planted in a different climate and therefore they are dying. These trees need to be replaced with trees that are more resilient to the climate situation of today and the City should not waste resources trying to maintain trees that are not going to survive.\n\nSusan Ringler, 82 Kinnaird Street, stated that the proposed ordinance is not nearly sufficient. She requested the entire City take a brief pause in cutting all trees on public and private land until the Urban Forestry Task Force can submit their recommendations and until the Tree Ordinance can be amended to actually give protection to mature trees. She spoke about a photograph on a news clipping shows residential land and those who cut the trees were not residents of the City; they were developers who purchased residential land and developed and sold it. She noted that this is the major problem with tree loss on residential land. She submitted a document showing the amount of carbon that a large tree takes out of the air is exponentially essential. She stated that the large trees are extremely valuable, and they need to be protected. She submitted two documents (ATTACHMENT D-1 AND D-2).\n\nCarol O\u2019Hare, 172, Magazine Street, supported getting a tally on tree removals but more importantly vigor and rigor are needed to effectively curtail tree removals. The ordinance needs to be corrected that would require simple tree removals, tree removals that are not associated with any project, to be covered by this ordinance, which it currently does not do. She gave the examples of someone who does not like shade or to rake leaves. This individual could remove the tree without doing anything. She stated that there should be a moratorium with specific exceptions and a waiver process. She stated that there are other cities that have done this. She stated that Public Works needs more personnel to monitor and enforcement this proposal. She submitted her comments (ATTACHMENT E). \n\nRichard Krushnic, 20 Oak Street, stated that he supported the proposal submitted by Councillor Zondervan and some kind of a moratorium. He stated that with the rapid development that the City is facing it is a given that there would be tree removal without some type of a moratorium. He stated that the tree loss rate is accelerating. He stated that the Public Works Department needs more resources. There are 500 empty tree wells that need trees in them. This will provide information for the task force. He stated that over half of the trees removed are on private residential land. He stated that the City needs some type of tree regulation on private residential land. He noted that the accelerated tree loss is due to accelerated development. He stated that the City needs a tree replacement regulation in place as soon as possible to stop this. \n\nAlison Field-Juma 363 Concord Avenue, stated that she supported the amendment. She stated that it should require public notice and permitting for the removal of all trees on private property for whatever the reason is. She added that there should be a justification for the removal and full mitigation of the negative impacts of any removal where it is shown that it is not essential. She commented that the City has a long history of restricting what property owners can do on their own property. She highlighted the benefits of trees. She gave an example of the private property issue. She used the dormer; she was unable to add a dormer to her roof to add a second bathroom. She noted that this application was denied. She stated that a large cooper beech tree was removed and cut down when the property changed ownership. She noted that this tree was a major asset to the neighborhood. She stated that she does not understand why this change was allowed when a small ascetic change is not. She acknowledged that there are good reasons to remove trees; she removed trees on her property but planted more replacement than removed. She stated that she wanted some aspects of this proposal strengthened. She submitted her comments (ATTACHMENT F).\n\nNancy Donohue, Director of Government Affairs, Chamber of Commerce, stated that members of the Chamber have expressed concern about certain aspects of the proposal and she spoke about unintended consequences. She requested that the Chamber be included in the discussions. She submitted her comments (ATTACHMENT G).\n\nSteven Nutter, Executive Director, Green Cambridge, stated that Cambridge is in a tree emergency and need the leadership of the City Council to plan a better future. He stated that this urgency means that this cannot wait. He stated that with the good work of the task force, this amendment sends an immediate communication to all that Cambridge is serious about solving this problem. He stated that the tree canopy will continue to decrease and will decease to 10% by 2030. He noted that there are many actions that can be taken, but it is simple plant more trees and stop cutting down the existing trees. The City Council leadership is needed to make this change and without your leadership this change cannot occur. He noted that the proposed amendment is a great first step to fix an outdated regulation, but this is only a first step. He stated that Green Cambridge will help promote this change and educate residents. He commented that trees make Cambridge livable and is a social justice and equity issue. \n\nHelen Kobek, 69R Gore Street, spoke about 100-year-old pin oak was destroyed. She wanted the strongest amendment to the ordinance. She wanted trees protected on private property and wanted a moratorium with adjustments as needed.\n\nSylvia Parsons, 22 Hancock Street, stated that she supported the amendment and is in favor of strengthening it and for some type of a moratorium on the cutting of trees in Cambridge with necessary exceptions. She noted that the timeline for climate change is unforgiving. She stated that the concept of replacing trees while planting new trees is a good thing, but a fully-grown tree cannot be replaced. She spoke about the benefits of trees in terms of carbon sequestration, mitigating heat wave and flood. She spoke about the life supporting element of trees with moss growth and supporting insects. She spoke about the complexities of the systems that are being destroyed. \n\nMarilyn Wellons, 651 Green Street, stated that feelings run high on this topic both pro and con. There are some that feel that trees are a danger, but others see the benefit of trees. She stated that this is a matter of life for both humans and mammals and also for plants. She wanted a moratorium. She stated that anything that the City Council does is necessarily part of the process. She commented that the need for action is now. She stated that she is concerned with the countervailing values at stake are embodied in the City\u2019s development strategies. She stated that the tree loss in residential neighborhoods is infill development in the name of additional units. She stated that the development in Kendall Square has removed trees. She went to many tree removal hearings. She wanted enforceable action and protection of trees including invasive and non-native. All trees sequester carbon and provide benefits regardless of their pedigree.\n\nJules Kobek, 69R Gore Street, supported the amendment. She stated that it is more important to protect large healthy tree rather than replace it with small saplings. She noted that a new sapling may die, and it takes decades for a sapling to grow to a large tree. She stated that there needs to be protections for trees sooner rather than later and penalties with teeth.\n\nKelly Dolan, 233 Upland Road, stated that she supported the amendment to the tree ordinance. She urged that a moratorium be proposed on cutting down any more trees in Cambridge. She spoke about the importance of trees in mitigating climate change by cleaning the air, shading the City and managing flood waters. The tree canopy needs to be treated as a valued asset. She noted that limiting property rights for private property is a difficult discussion, but the collective well-being of the residents and the tree canopy needs to supersede the personal rights of individuals. She stated that having clean air and water is a social justice issue. She submitted written comments (ATTACHMENT H).\n\nFranciscan Amedeo, 239 Mt. Auburn Street, trustee of Riverbend Park, stated that she wanted the City Council to include trees on public land. She stated that the Sycamore trees are in crisis along Riverbend Park. She supported the amendment as a first step. All possible things need to be done to mitigate climate change and trees have an important role. She encouraged the City Council to be more aggressive in addressing climate change. She wanted to see more funding for planting trees on public land.\n\nPat Goudvis, 179 Harvey Street, encouraged the City Council to approve the amendment. This is an emergency and we need something stronger than the amendment. She noted that all benefit from trees.\n\nJohn Pitkin, 18 Fayette Street, member of the Friends of Inman Square, who are still working to preserve the trees in the plaza in Inman Square. He stated that he favored the proposed amendment. He noted that this would enable the City to acquire valuable information on tree removals from private property on an ongoing basis. This would also provide an opportunity to educate property owners in a critical moment on the life of a tree. The City needs to communicate in order to have an impact on property owners\u2019 decisions to cut trees. He stated that our survival depends on trees; individuals cannot live without trees. He stated that trees are living beings that take a few hours to kill and a lifetime to regrow. There is no such thing as just one tree, whether public or private. These concepts are necessary for any voluntary measure to stop the loss of the tree canopy. He spoke about creating a culture of awareness and stewardship. He stated that a moratorium on the removal of trees from private land would be a beneficial measure when the task force makes their recommendations.\n\nCharles Franklin, 162 Hampshire Street, stated that he supported the proposal. He highlighted the importance of trees and the quality of life. He noted that the City does plant trees but has a hard time keeping them alive.\n\nMaggie Booz, 27 Lawn Street, spoke about this amendment bringing the tree emergency to the public floor. She does not support the amendment as it is inadequate, ineffective and it is premature to make ordinance changes before the work of the Tree Task Force and the consultant have come to conclusions about how to solve the crisis. What is not premature and is called for is a complete moratorium on tree cutting in the City until the task force has completed its work. She spoke about issues introduced by Hildebrand to the monthly meetings of the tree task force. She stated that by 2030 with the current planting, 600 trees a year, there will only be 1/2 the tree canopy of what the City has now. She stated that by 2070 there will be 9% of what the City has now. She stated that this is a big problem.\n\nElaine Saporta, 102 Ellery Street, stated that she is a landscape architect and a member of tree task force. She noted that the tree task force is only halfway through the process and the news is not good. She stated that it is known what is killing the trees. She named development, over-salting, disease and the changing climate pressure and four years of successive drought as some of the reasons. She stated that this is a state of emergency. She supported a six-month moratorium on the cutting of all trees in the City.\n\nFlorrie Wescoat, 33 Market Street, stated that she is the Co-chair of the Committee on Public Planting, a member of the tree task force and a member of the Friends of Inman Square. She stated that currently there is no incentive for developers or property owners to preserve trees. Trees are being removed for development and housing infill. She noted that there is less permeable space for planting in the City. She stated that individuals want trees to shade them; to enhance the quality of life and to enjoy. She commented that this is an issue of equity and social justice. She stated that the notion of a pro-tree stance is anti-development or anti-housing is false. She stated that the City needs development that respects the trees and to plant more. The City needs to be leader to protect and preserve public trees. She appreciated the City\u2019s commitment to an Urban Forest Master Plan but because of the rapid diminishment of the canopy in Cambridge she urged a moratorium on tree cutting while the Urban Forest Master Plan is being developed.\n\nPaula Sharaga, 234 Columbia Street, stated that she has seen many trees planted which have died. She noted that Columbia Street is an area where there is a need for trees to be planted. She supported the amendment but wanted the proposal to have more teeth, enforceable and a moratorium until this can be figured out.\n\nPeter Valentine, 37 Brookline Street, stated that he magically intends to grow all the trees. He added that the money worshippers are killing the trees. They will be completely eliminated from the earth.\n\nDick Clary, 15 Brookford Street, Chair, North Cambridge Stabilization Committee, and a board member of the Association of Cambridge Neighborhoods, stated that he favored a moratorium and the case for a moratorium has been overwhelmingly made. He spoke about how this issue developed for him. He stated that 130 years ago Charles Eliot stirred the people up over the destruction of the Waverly Oaks along the Belmont and Waltham line. He explained that the citizen involvement that this created ended up with the creation of the MDC. He noted that this is an example of what can happen when there is a sufficient outrage being perpetrated. He stated that the present-day Charles Eliot has put together a document, a newspaper, that contains an enormous amount of information. \n\nJo Solet, 15 Berkeley Street, spoke about enforcement and was disturbed that in some way the leaf blower ordinance was considered a model here. She stated that violating the ordinance is the cost of doing business for landscapers. She spoke about all the violations to the leaf blower ordinance by contractors hired by the City. She stated that homeowner need to be included in the enforcement.\n\nCharles Teague, 23 Edmonds Street, distributed a list of 27 moratoriums passed by the City Council (ATTACHMENT I). He stated one moratorium that is not on the list is the bio lab moratorium and it has shaped Cambridge. He stated that this is not a big a deal and will not take as long. He stated that the task force has already presented. The consultants, the Conservation Law Foundation, have presented their nationwide review of tree laws on October 3, 2018 and in December guidelines were presented to change the laws. He stated that in 2002 the Supreme Court approved a moratorium for a short period of time, for less than a year. He urged the City Council to choose a moratorium. \n\nRonda Massie, 211 Charles Street, spoke about balancing open space with development. She stated that the City\u2019s record on open space and trees is dismal. She acknowledged that it may be difficult to encourage homeowners and developers to retain trees, it is disheartening to witness the number of trees that have disappeared in the last several years. She spoke about the tree loss in the parking lot at the Charter School on Bent Street because of the difficulty of plowing around trees. She spoke about infill development and the $3 million condos built that made it imperative that the trees were cut down for these condos. She spoke about trees planted on both sides of Third Street from Kendall Square to Cambridge Street. She stated that the City planted trees and did not water and none of these trees survived. She spoke about the loss of open space and trees at the Volpe Center. \n\nKate Frank, 53 Crescent Street, stated that all neighborhoods will be affected by the tree problem. She stated that people are speaking about this because it is our civic responsibility. She spoke about the Japanese who planted fruit trees so that future generations will have fruit and wanted Cambridge to have a similar attitude about our trees. She asked the issue of private property be rethought. She spoke about the need for education and it could be as successful as the composting program. She stated that it may not move fast enough, but some movement is better than none. \n\nEllen Mass, President of the Friends of the Alewife Reservation, spoke about a moratorium and the awareness about trees were not in front of the public previously. She stated that this would have been a wonderful hearing to have had before the Silver Maple Forest was taken down. She stated that most of the discussion has been about the past, but she wants to discuss what is coming up. There is a situation in North Cambridge where there is a one-acre arboretum of sixty trees that were carefully planted forty years ago which is a crime waiting to happen because the two developers have misrepresented their building special permit to the Planning Board in December 2017 by leaving off the major canopy of these rare arboretum planted trees. There is a new design map, but it does not go along with what is in the tree ordinance. She stated that the tree ordinance states that a full display of the entire design must be given twenty-one days before the hearing by the Planning Board. This was not done. She stated that there was a major misrepresentation of the design which had a court yard with these arboretums. She noted that the Public Works Department is going to investigate this situation. She explained that the trees need to be removed to construct a garage underneath. \n\nErick Grunbaum, 98 Montgomery street, stated that he supports a moratorium; the tree canopy is in serious decline. He planted trees in The Port in the l990s where at the time it cost $125 to get a street tree. He stated that he sought and received a grant to subsidize this for those who could not afford to plant trees. There are massive opportunities to plant more trees. He spoke about counting the opportunities in the empty spaces in the sidewalks, not the empty tree wells, the spaces where trees can be planted. He stated that 2,500-3000 locations had been found in each of two quadrants of the City. This could yield 10,000-15,000 street trees which are the most important trees. This is what provides shade and greenery. He stated that the City needs to do a better job in investing in the canopy. He added that a short-term moratorium in reasonable. He supported more investment in the canopy, both in staffing and financing. \n\nCouncillor Kelley closed public comment at 7:17 PM.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan proposed and amendment and stated that Councillor Kelley wanted to capture the retroactive nature of the tree protection. His amendment was to change the title of section 8.66.055 to strike out the word \u201cProcedure for Other Projects\u201d and insert in place thereof the words \u201cProcedure for Other Significant Tree Removals.\u201d He further moved to amend the section by striking out the first sentence and inserting in place thereof a new sentence which reads as follows: For any significant tree removal not subject to 8.66.050, except for emergency circumstances, a permit request will first be submitted to the City Arborist. He stated that a general moratorium on tree cutting cannot be considered because it is not part of this proposal. He stated that what the committee could consider is to not issue any permits proposed in this section until the ordinance is further amended based on the recommendations of the tree task force. He stated that he wanted the committee to consider this concept. \n\nCouncillor Kelley noted that the amendment offered by Councillor Zondervan was to bring all significant trees under this section, not just those trees associated with a project. \n\nThe second suggestion was to prohibit the granting of any permits until after the tree task force finishes its work. Councillor Zondervan added that the ordinance could be amended based on their recommendations.\n\nCouncillor Kelley moved for a recess at 7:22 PM.\n\nCouncillor Kelley reconvened the hearing at 7:24 PM.\n\nCouncillor Kelley noted that there is a lot of public interest in a moratorium. He stated that another hearing can be scheduled to discuss the amendments by Councillor Zondervan and does the committee want to delay the granting of any permits which would be a defector moratorium or want to discuss a moratorium in some other fashion.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan stated that he wanted his clarifying amendments acted upon and can discuss a moratorium when the ordinance is adopted. He stated that he did not favor having another Ordinance Committee hearing and wanted this proposal to move forward to the full City Council.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux stated that she would vote in favor of the amendments offered by Councillor Zondervan and forward this to the full City Council. \n\nCouncillor Mallon stated that she was under the impression that regarding ordinance committee hearings that the committee could make something less restrictive and not more restrictive. She added that a moratorium seems more restrictive. Deputy City Solicitor Goldberg responded that this applies to zoning provisions where there has been advertised zoning language and the City Council may be trying to make significant changes to this language and there may be restrictions based on the language. He stated that this is not a zoning ordinance and the issue of restrictions does not apply. The City Council can consider something that has been advertised. He stated that the issue of these amendments has been advertised. \n\nCouncillor Kelley stated that he is uncomfortable with passing a moratorium now and does not understand the implications. He added that the moratorium was not part of the call of the hearing. He stated that when this was advertised to the public it was if you care about trees and want public notice about cutting down trees come to this hearing. This was not advertised as if you care about a moratorium come to this hearing. He stated that he feels that this is a huge difference. He stated that there can be another hearing scheduled to specifically discuss a moratorium. He stated that this is a dangerous way to go. He would vote on the amendments but would not vote to move this out of committee. \n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that he supports a moratorium but agreed with Councillor Kelley\u2019s interpretation. \n\nCouncillor Zondervan stated that the amendment he forwarded to the City Clerk does not reference a moratorium; it is just the clarifying language. He moved his amendments and stated that after amending he would move to refer to the full City Council. He stated that when the issue gets before the City Council a general moratorium could be discussed or not. Councillor Kelley stated that discussing a moratorium in the Ordinance Committee is a much better place for this discussion. He stated that he supported amending the language and keeping the matter in committee for another hearing and forwarding to the full City Council. He added that the subject of a moratorium should be the subject of a full hearing. Councillor Zondervan stated that a more general moratorium is a separate discussion and should not encumber the amendments. He is asking that the amendments be moved forward and then discuss a moratorium as part of a separate discussion.\n\nThe question now came on the amendments to change the title and the language of the first sentence in 8.66.055 submitted by Councillor Zondervan - and on a voice vote of six members the amendments -\n\nCarried.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan now moved that the amended proposal to the full City Council for further discussion. \n\nCouncillor Kelley stated that he thinks that this is a bad idea and would like to explore the idea of what a moratorium might look like.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux asked how the Ordinance Committee would discuss having a moratorium. She asked would there need to be language in front of the committee.\n\nCouncillor Kelley noted that it always best to have language before the committee.\n\nHe stated that Councillor Zondervan had an idea of making the permitting authority of the City Arborist start only when the City Council had some type of actionable things from the tree task force and if the committee met to discuss this Councillor Zondervan or anyone else could provide language for discussion. \n\nCouncillor Zondervan stated that he is suggesting that a moratorium is a general conversation and may be enacted in the way he proposed or may not, but he would prefer this conversation with the full City Council and this conversation could always be brought back to the Ordinance Committee. He stated that he did not want to delay moving this forward since there is consensus around the clarifying language. The moratorium is a separate question on whether there should be a moratorium on significant tree removals or for all trees removals. He stated that the full City Council should be part of this conversation. He stated that rather than keeping this in committee he would prefer that this amendment be forwarded to the full City Council and then the City Council can decide whether it wants to have a further conversation about a moratorium or to adopt this amendment as is or enact a moratorium differently than through this proposal. He stated that these are broader questions than his amendment which did not include language for a moratorium. \n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that the only way that the City Council could discuss a moratorium if there is a petition submitted. He asked how this would be discussed at the City Council level. City Clerk Lopez stated that this is an amendment to the Municipal Code and amendments can be made at any time. She explained that the Ordinance Committee report would go before the full City Council who could accept the report and place it on file and pass to a second reading the original proposal as amended by Councillor Zondervan. Two weeks later the proposal would be before the City Council for ordination and at this point the proposal could be amended on the floor to add language regarding a moratorium. Then it is up to the full City Council if they wanted to pass the proposal to be ordained as amended.\n\nCouncillor Kelley commented that it is simpler and cleaner to figure what is wanted in the Ordinance Committee than at a City Council meeting. \n\nCouncillor Kelley moved that this be referred to the full City Council and on the motion the roll was called and resulted as follows:\n\nYEAS: Councillor Carlone, Vice Mayor Devereux, Councillor Mallon, Councillor\n\nSiddiqui and Councillor Zondervan \\- 5\n\nNAYS: Councillor Kelley \\- 1\n\nABSENT: Councillor Simmons, Councillor Toomey and Mayor\n\nMcGovern \\- 3\n\nand the matter was -\n\nReferred to the full City Council.\n\nThe following communications were received and made part of the report:\n\nA communication from Gretchen Friesinger, 18 Orchard Street, in support of Councillor Zondervan\u2019s proposal to gather more data and supporting a tree cutting moratorium (ATTACHMENT J).\n\nA communication was received from Share Brodie, 253 Pleasant Street, in support of the proposed amendment to strengthen tree protection and in support of a moratorium (ATTACHMENT K).\n\nA communication was received from Bjorn Poonen, 303 Third Street, in support of the proposed amendment and suggesting the phrase \u201csignificant tree\u201d be used.

Alexander, 4 Crawford Street.\n\nCouncillor Kelley convened the hearing and stated the purpose. He announced that the hearing was being audio and video recorded. He highlighted the format of the hearing.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan gave a PowerPoint Presentation (ATTACHMENT B). He stated that the current Tree Protection Ordinance was adopted in 2004 but it does not protect trees. It applies to a limited part of the canopy. It applies to large projects that need to undergo large project reviews. This is for 25,000 square feet or above projects and does not pertain to affordable housing projects. The current ordinance is retroactive to one year prior to a special permit application. If an individual were to cut down trees two years ago and then apply for a special permit on the property these trees would not be covered under the ordinance. Only trees cut down within one year of applying for a special permit are covered. This applies to trees over eight inches in diameter at chest height. He stated that the ordinance has a replacement plan which allows for a payment, based on a variety of conditions, to be made into the Tree Fund instead of replanting trees or not cutting them down in the first place. He stated that the ordinance does not cover any trees cut down outside of large project review projects, any tree cut down more than one year prior to a special permit application and affordable housing projects. He outlined the proposed amendment. He explained that the amendment would preserve the affordable housing exemption. The ordinance also exempts dangerous and emergency situations. He stated that the amendment does require a permit for significant trees more than eight inches that are removed and are not part of a large project review, in which case they would already be covered, or if removed more than one year ago. He stated that the permit would be issued by Public Works and would be discretionary and would document why the tree was cut down and the specifics pertaining to the tree being cut down. He commented that no one cuts down their own large trees. A contractor is hired. He stated that the City would inform the contractors that a permit is required and that would help compliance. Contractors can obtain permits on behalf of the property owner. He explained why this proposed amendment is needed now. He stated that 18% of the tree canopy has been lost in the last 9 years based on preliminary data. He stated that the current data shows that the loss is worse, and the task force analysis is showing that there will be more loss in the future. He stated that the two solutions to the problem are to stop cutting down trees and to plant more trees. He acknowledged the work of Urban Forest Tree Task Force and noted that the Task Force will be making recommendations in the future. \n\nVice Mayor Devereux asked why this did not include Wheeler Street. Councillor Zondervan responded because it has inclusionary housing units. Vice Mayor Devereux stated that to her affordable housing does not include inclusionary housing. This does not apply to Wheeler Street and does apply to Millers River.\n\nCouncillor Kelley stated that the copy of the ordinance he is looking at does not have a retroactive date of one year. Councillor Zondervan stated that this is in the current ordinance. Councillor Kelley stated that it would be a retroactive hearing for trees that have already been cut down. He stated that there would be a violation of cutting down trees within one year of the special permit application.\n\nCommissioner O\u2019Riordan stated that the existing ordinance applies to large projects and there is nothing at this time regarding tree removal private property in the City that is not associated with a large project. This does place a burden on the staff with this new amendment and he asked how this ordinance will be enforced and if a tree is removed without a permit how is this handled by the City. When legislation has been enacted such as plastic bags or polystyrene there has been significant outreach and education programs prior to promulgating the ordinance. He stated that it is custom that the City provides notice and educational documents before implementing a change in regulations. He stated that his concern is that this is going to take time for the City to do this. He stated that the Urban Forestry Masterplan has been ongoing for the last eight months and it will be a while before the report will be ready for consideration by the City Council. He stated that the integrity of this work needs to be maintained and shared thoughts about changes to existing ordinances while this work is on-going so that the City Council can be provided with a thorough analysis of what other communities are doing, how best the City can provide different ordinances and/or regulations so as to better protect the tree canopy. He wanted to make the City Council cognizant of the Task Force\u2019s work as the Council considers changes to the existing ordinance. \n\nCouncillor Mallon asked has there been any preliminary discussion with the Urban Forestry Task Force on this issue. She stated that the draft recommendations will be done in May. She stated that the goal of this ordinance is to collect data and to have conversations around alternatives. Commissioner O\u2019Riordan stated that the first few months of the task force was providing background on the existing urban tree canopy, the loss and where the loss is most pronounced. He stated that the loss is most pronounced in residential areas in the City. He stated that the reason for the loss is uncertain at this time. He stated that that are reviewing closer the loss in residential areas and are looking at the degree to which pervious areas have been lost. He stated that this may be related to redevelopment or extended development on residential properties. He stated that the City is also looking at house sales and whether properties have been redeveloped where trees have been removed as a result of development. He stated that in terms of changing ordinance and regulations and a meeting held in December looked at changing the definition of significant tree. He stated that presently a significant tree is an eight-inch tree. He stated that they are looking at a six-inch tree being a significant tree, and this is consistent with what other communities are doing. He stated that they are looking at regulating tree loss across the entire City, looking at changing the way that mitigation costs are proposed and looking a mitigation when significant trees are cut down and diameter of trees at breast height and the area of a tree trunk at breast height. He stated that tree species are being reviewed. He stated that there is details that are been reviewed as to how to protect trees in the community. He stated that it is important to let this conversation continue. He spoke about the more significant protections for trees the more onerous it become for homeowners to take down trees. He added people may be less likely to plant trees in the future as well. He stated that there is a balance needed in incentivizing planting trees on private property. He spoke about protecting people\u2019s ownership of property and rights of homeowners to protect their property. He noted that there are five more meetings scheduled. \n\nCouncillor Mallon stated that in May when the draft recommendations from Urban Forestry Task Force come out will there be something that the City Council can work with from that that addresses the issues outlined by the Commissioner of Public Works or does the City Council have to wait for the final recommendations in December. She asked if this ordinance does not get passed is there a way to have the data collected between now and May. Commissioner O\u2019Riordan stated that all the presentations, minutes and correspondence from the public are on line on the Public Works page. He stated that the expectation is that the draft report will also be on line. The draft report may contain specific recommendations or may be more general. He stated that the report will be detailed. He is unsure about the successfulness of the data collection. He stated that the University of Vermont is working with the City on this and they did the 2009 and 2014 studies and they have been asked to look at the current 2018 study for consistency of the analysis.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that the proposed ordinance changes are benign. There is nothing in this proposal that is threatening. He suggested sending out postcards and noted that word of mouth travels fast. Awaiting the recommendations in May and what might be possibly ordained in September at the earliest, this proposal is not a terrible thing to have on the books and may not be enforced immediately, isn\u2019t this a good start to let people know that there is a concern. Commissioner O\u2019Riordan stated that it is benign from the perspective of the homeowner. He expressed his concern about enforcement and it is an onerous undertaking from the City\u2019s perspective. The amendment speaks to emergency circumstances and this is not defined in this proposal and asked what is considered an emergency. He spoke about the one-year period of time is defined for significant trees, larger than eight inches. He stated that he does not think the proposed amendment is applicable for a special permit unless there is a change in the definition of a significant tree. Councillor Carlone spoke about making the language stronger and clearer. Commissioner O\u2019Riordan stated that if one is to remove any reference to a period of time does this mean that a property that lost a tree ten years ago would have to have this mitigated to develop their property now.\n\nCouncillor Siddiqui spoke about urgency and competing with a process and how is this balanced. There are policy strategies could be considered now or do we or can we wait. She stated that she is struggling with this with that data before the City, the tree canopy loss and climate change. \n\nVice Mayor Devereux stated that we have already waited; this conversation began early last term. She stated that the City Council was prodded to start this Urban Forestry Task Force, and this took six months to get this going. She stated that there is no penalty in this ordinance. She spoke about the concern with enforcement and used the example of Airbnb which the City is having trouble enforcing. She stated that this interferes with the work of the Urban Forestry Task Force and that the City Council acknowledges the urgency of their works and want to support them. She added that all this is doing is gathering data and it is not imposing any fines and does no more than allow the arborist to have a conversation to suggest an alternative to the property owner. The longer before these conversations occur, the more trees will be cut down. She wanted this proposal approved.\n\nDeputy City Solicitor Goldberg stated that the enforcement provisions existing in the ordinance would apply to this amended provision. He stated that the existing enforcement provisions mention a stop work order if tree are removed in violation of the chapter and there could be penalties imposed. \n\nCouncillor Zondervan agreed emergency circumstance are not defined and this is on purpose to give this discretion to the arborist to determine if an emergency exists. He would be fine adopting this as is and that this does not apply to any trees more than one year. He stated that he does not believe that this is retroactive from ordination and would not apply to trees cut down ten years ago.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux asked why this is worded makes trees not subject to the current ordinance and if included as proposed a permit request why the other enforcement mechanism apply. Deputy City Solicitor Goldberg stated that he is not sure that the tree replacement fund provisions would apply to the mitigation plan. He stated that the enforcement section, 8.66.090, applies to enforcement remedies, including a stop work order, fines of $300 per violation, the possibility of injunctive relief and alternative penalties for non-criminal penalty. Councillor Zondervan stated that subsection D does specifically reference the large project and it does not apply. Deputy City Solicitor Goldberg agreed. Vice Mayor Devereux spoke about Councillor Zondervan\u2019s intent when drafting the proposed amendment. She stated that the City Council can state that enforcement does not apply to this other type of tree. Deputy City Solicitor Goldberg stated that the ordinance could be written this way but if there is no enforcement provision there is no incentive to comply with the ordinance. If there is no compliance, there is no penalty for compliance. This is an ordinance without any teeth. The way the amendment is written and if this section is being added in it is being put in the context of the ordinance and it does have the enforcement provision. Vice Mayor Devereux stated that a different approach to enforcement could be suggested. She stated that a mechanism could be developed that would make the contractor responsible, such as leaf blower ordinance. \n\nCouncillor Kelley stated that if the concern is about retroactivity he suggested language at the end: This section is only applicable to trees standing as of enactment of this section. He stated that if someone is cutting down trees not related to a project this is not included in the ordinance. He asked if this is the intent. Councillor Zondervan stated that this states procedures for other projects and the language could be changed to all projects or significant trees. He stated that the intent is that this new section would apply everywhere where the current section does not. \n\nAt 6:16 PM Councillor Kelley opened the hearing to public comment.\n\nLucas James Gyrator, 225 Brookline Street, spoke about the proposal by Councillor Zondervan for tree protection. He requested the inclusion and consideration of the following knowledge and guidelines. He requested that all trees in the City of Cambridge are completely protected by the City\u2019s systematic processes of protection. He requested that the protection apply to all trees on public, private, commercial, state and City properties and preservations. He requested that the implementation of this protection be effective to all trees of any kind. He requested that trees be protected especially on private land. He stated that trees of this City are beings of this earth and are to be respected for their life and being. They provide oxygen and are the reason we are currently breathing. Trees filter the air and contribute to the eco-system of all planetary life. He noted that trees are not owned by the City or its people even though they may grow on illegally owned land or the land of private owners or in public space. He stated that the concept of the ownership of a tree is out of the hands of any one person and thus trees do not fall under the ownership of people at all. He submitted his comments (ATTACHMENT C).\n\nChristine Kuta, 7 Fairview Avenue, stated that the permitting process is a burden on the private land owner. She stated that she has a tiny house on a small lot of land and it is difficult to maintain. She stated that going through what seems a benign process of a permit is another thing she has to deal with to get anything done on her land and it is also a burden on the arborist. She noted that when the street trees around her house needed to be trimmed it took a year to get this done. She stated that currently there is a public dead tree across the street and has not been taken down since last year. The Public Works Department is overburdened. She was not in favor of the permitting to add more work no matter how benign this is. She stated that she does care about the tree canopy of the City but disagrees with this new policy that is based on maintaining the status quo. Climate change is here, and the trees planted years ago were planted in a different climate and therefore they are dying. These trees need to be replaced with trees that are more resilient to the climate situation of today and the City should not waste resources trying to maintain trees that are not going to survive.\n\nSusan Ringler, 82 Kinnaird Street, stated that the proposed ordinance is not nearly sufficient. She requested the entire City take a brief pause in cutting all trees on public and private land until the Urban Forestry Task Force can submit their recommendations and until the Tree Ordinance can be amended to actually give protection to mature trees. She spoke about a photograph on a news clipping shows residential land and those who cut the trees were not residents of the City; they were developers who purchased residential land and developed and sold it. She noted that this is the major problem with tree loss on residential land. She submitted a document showing the amount of carbon that a large tree takes out of the air is exponentially essential. She stated that the large trees are extremely valuable, and they need to be protected. She submitted two documents (ATTACHMENT D-1 AND D-2).\n\nCarol O\u2019Hare, 172, Magazine Street, supported getting a tally on tree removals but more importantly vigor and rigor are needed to effectively curtail tree removals. The ordinance needs to be corrected that would require simple tree removals, tree removals that are not associated with any project, to be covered by this ordinance, which it currently does not do. She gave the examples of someone who does not like shade or to rake leaves. This individual could remove the tree without doing anything. She stated that there should be a moratorium with specific exceptions and a waiver process. She stated that there are other cities that have done this. She stated that Public Works needs more personnel to monitor and enforcement this proposal. She submitted her comments (ATTACHMENT E). \n\nRichard Krushnic, 20 Oak Street, stated that he supported the proposal submitted by Councillor Zondervan and some kind of a moratorium. He stated that with the rapid development that the City is facing it is a given that there would be tree removal without some type of a moratorium. He stated that the tree loss rate is accelerating. He stated that the Public Works Department needs more resources. There are 500 empty tree wells that need trees in them. This will provide information for the task force. He stated that over half of the trees removed are on private residential land. He stated that the City needs some type of tree regulation on private residential land. He noted that the accelerated tree loss is due to accelerated development. He stated that the City needs a tree replacement regulation in place as soon as possible to stop this. \n\nAlison Field-Juma 363 Concord Avenue, stated that she supported the amendment. She stated that it should require public notice and permitting for the removal of all trees on private property for whatever the reason is. She added that there should be a justification for the removal and full mitigation of the negative impacts of any removal where it is shown that it is not essential. She commented that the City has a long history of restricting what property owners can do on their own property. She highlighted the benefits of trees. She gave an example of the private property issue. She used the dormer; she was unable to add a dormer to her roof to add a second bathroom. She noted that this application was denied. She stated that a large cooper beech tree was removed and cut down when the property changed ownership. She noted that this tree was a major asset to the neighborhood. She stated that she does not understand why this change was allowed when a small ascetic change is not. She acknowledged that there are good reasons to remove trees; she removed trees on her property but planted more replacement than removed. She stated that she wanted some aspects of this proposal strengthened. She submitted her comments (ATTACHMENT F).\n\nNancy Donohue, Director of Government Affairs, Chamber of Commerce, stated that members of the Chamber have expressed concern about certain aspects of the proposal and she spoke about unintended consequences. She requested that the Chamber be included in the discussions. She submitted her comments (ATTACHMENT G).\n\nSteven Nutter, Executive Director, Green Cambridge, stated that Cambridge is in a tree emergency and need the leadership of the City Council to plan a better future. He stated that this urgency means that this cannot wait. He stated that with the good work of the task force, this amendment sends an immediate communication to all that Cambridge is serious about solving this problem. He stated that the tree canopy will continue to decrease and will decease to 10% by 2030. He noted that there are many actions that can be taken, but it is simple plant more trees and stop cutting down the existing trees. The City Council leadership is needed to make this change and without your leadership this change cannot occur. He noted that the proposed amendment is a great first step to fix an outdated regulation, but this is only a first step. He stated that Green Cambridge will help promote this change and educate residents. He commented that trees make Cambridge livable and is a social justice and equity issue. \n\nHelen Kobek, 69R Gore Street, spoke about 100-year-old pin oak was destroyed. She wanted the strongest amendment to the ordinance. She wanted trees protected on private property and wanted a moratorium with adjustments as needed.\n\nSylvia Parsons, 22 Hancock Street, stated that she supported the amendment and is in favor of strengthening it and for some type of a moratorium on the cutting of trees in Cambridge with necessary exceptions. She noted that the timeline for climate change is unforgiving. She stated that the concept of replacing trees while planting new trees is a good thing, but a fully-grown tree cannot be replaced. She spoke about the benefits of trees in terms of carbon sequestration, mitigating heat wave and flood. She spoke about the life supporting element of trees with moss growth and supporting insects. She spoke about the complexities of the systems that are being destroyed. \n\nMarilyn Wellons, 651 Green Street, stated that feelings run high on this topic both pro and con. There are some that feel that trees are a danger, but others see the benefit of trees. She stated that this is a matter of life for both humans and mammals and also for plants. She wanted a moratorium. She stated that anything that the City Council does is necessarily part of the process. She commented that the need for action is now. She stated that she is concerned with the countervailing values at stake are embodied in the City\u2019s development strategies. She stated that the tree loss in residential neighborhoods is infill development in the name of additional units. She stated that the development in Kendall Square has removed trees. She went to many tree removal hearings. She wanted enforceable action and protection of trees including invasive and non-native. All trees sequester carbon and provide benefits regardless of their pedigree.\n\nJules Kobek, 69R Gore Street, supported the amendment. She stated that it is more important to protect large healthy tree rather than replace it with small saplings. She noted that a new sapling may die, and it takes decades for a sapling to grow to a large tree. She stated that there needs to be protections for trees sooner rather than later and penalties with teeth.\n\nKelly Dolan, 233 Upland Road, stated that she supported the amendment to the tree ordinance. She urged that a moratorium be proposed on cutting down any more trees in Cambridge. She spoke about the importance of trees in mitigating climate change by cleaning the air, shading the City and managing flood waters. The tree canopy needs to be treated as a valued asset. She noted that limiting property rights for private property is a difficult discussion, but the collective well-being of the residents and the tree canopy needs to supersede the personal rights of individuals. She stated that having clean air and water is a social justice issue. She submitted written comments (ATTACHMENT H).\n\nFranciscan Amedeo, 239 Mt. Auburn Street, trustee of Riverbend Park, stated that she wanted the City Council to include trees on public land. She stated that the Sycamore trees are in crisis along Riverbend Park. She supported the amendment as a first step. All possible things need to be done to mitigate climate change and trees have an important role. She encouraged the City Council to be more aggressive in addressing climate change. She wanted to see more funding for planting trees on public land.\n\nPat Goudvis, 179 Harvey Street, encouraged the City Council to approve the amendment. This is an emergency and we need something stronger than the amendment. She noted that all benefit from trees.\n\nJohn Pitkin, 18 Fayette Street, member of the Friends of Inman Square, who are still working to preserve the trees in the plaza in Inman Square. He stated that he favored the proposed amendment. He noted that this would enable the City to acquire valuable information on tree removals from private property on an ongoing basis. This would also provide an opportunity to educate property owners in a critical moment on the life of a tree. The City needs to communicate in order to have an impact on property owners\u2019 decisions to cut trees. He stated that our survival depends on trees; individuals cannot live without trees. He stated that trees are living beings that take a few hours to kill and a lifetime to regrow. There is no such thing as just one tree, whether public or private. These concepts are necessary for any voluntary measure to stop the loss of the tree canopy. He spoke about creating a culture of awareness and stewardship. He stated that a moratorium on the removal of trees from private land would be a beneficial measure when the task force makes their recommendations.\n\nCharles Franklin, 162 Hampshire Street, stated that he supported the proposal. He highlighted the importance of trees and the quality of life. He noted that the City does plant trees but has a hard time keeping them alive.\n\nMaggie Booz, 27 Lawn Street, spoke about this amendment bringing the tree emergency to the public floor. She does not support the amendment as it is inadequate, ineffective and it is premature to make ordinance changes before the work of the Tree Task Force and the consultant have come to conclusions about how to solve the crisis. What is not premature and is called for is a complete moratorium on tree cutting in the City until the task force has completed its work. She spoke about issues introduced by Hildebrand to the monthly meetings of the tree task force. She stated that by 2030 with the current planting, 600 trees a year, there will only be 1/2 the tree canopy of what the City has now. She stated that by 2070 there will be 9% of what the City has now. She stated that this is a big problem.\n\nElaine Saporta, 102 Ellery Street, stated that she is a landscape architect and a member of tree task force. She noted that the tree task force is only halfway through the process and the news is not good. She stated that it is known what is killing the trees. She named development, over-salting, disease and the changing climate pressure and four years of successive drought as some of the reasons. She stated that this is a state of emergency. She supported a six-month moratorium on the cutting of all trees in the City.\n\nFlorrie Wescoat, 33 Market Street, stated that she is the Co-chair of the Committee on Public Planting, a member of the tree task force and a member of the Friends of Inman Square. She stated that currently there is no incentive for developers or property owners to preserve trees. Trees are being removed for development and housing infill. She noted that there is less permeable space for planting in the City. She stated that individuals want trees to shade them; to enhance the quality of life and to enjoy. She commented that this is an issue of equity and social justice. She stated that the notion of a pro-tree stance is anti-development or anti-housing is false. She stated that the City needs development that respects the trees and to plant more. The City needs to be leader to protect and preserve public trees. She appreciated the City\u2019s commitment to an Urban Forest Master Plan but because of the rapid diminishment of the canopy in Cambridge she urged a moratorium on tree cutting while the Urban Forest Master Plan is being developed.\n\nPaula Sharaga, 234 Columbia Street, stated that she has seen many trees planted which have died. She noted that Columbia Street is an area where there is a need for trees to be planted. She supported the amendment but wanted the proposal to have more teeth, enforceable and a moratorium until this can be figured out.\n\nPeter Valentine, 37 Brookline Street, stated that he magically intends to grow all the trees. He added that the money worshippers are killing the trees. They will be completely eliminated from the earth.\n\nDick Clary, 15 Brookford Street, Chair, North Cambridge Stabilization Committee, and a board member of the Association of Cambridge Neighborhoods, stated that he favored a moratorium and the case for a moratorium has been overwhelmingly made. He spoke about how this issue developed for him. He stated that 130 years ago Charles Eliot stirred the people up over the destruction of the Waverly Oaks along the Belmont and Waltham line. He explained that the citizen involvement that this created ended up with the creation of the MDC. He noted that this is an example of what can happen when there is a sufficient outrage being perpetrated. He stated that the present-day Charles Eliot has put together a document, a newspaper, that contains an enormous amount of information. \n\nJo Solet, 15 Berkeley Street, spoke about enforcement and was disturbed that in some way the leaf blower ordinance was considered a model here. She stated that violating the ordinance is the cost of doing business for landscapers. She spoke about all the violations to the leaf blower ordinance by contractors hired by the City. She stated that homeowner need to be included in the enforcement.\n\nCharles Teague, 23 Edmonds Street, distributed a list of 27 moratoriums passed by the City Council (ATTACHMENT I). He stated one moratorium that is not on the list is the bio lab moratorium and it has shaped Cambridge. He stated that this is not a big a deal and will not take as long. He stated that the task force has already presented. The consultants, the Conservation Law Foundation, have presented their nationwide review of tree laws on October 3, 2018 and in December guidelines were presented to change the laws. He stated that in 2002 the Supreme Court approved a moratorium for a short period of time, for less than a year. He urged the City Council to choose a moratorium. \n\nRonda Massie, 211 Charles Street, spoke about balancing open space with development. She stated that the City\u2019s record on open space and trees is dismal. She acknowledged that it may be difficult to encourage homeowners and developers to retain trees, it is disheartening to witness the number of trees that have disappeared in the last several years. She spoke about the tree loss in the parking lot at the Charter School on Bent Street because of the difficulty of plowing around trees. She spoke about infill development and the $3 million condos built that made it imperative that the trees were cut down for these condos. She spoke about trees planted on both sides of Third Street from Kendall Square to Cambridge Street. She stated that the City planted trees and did not water and none of these trees survived. She spoke about the loss of open space and trees at the Volpe Center. \n\nKate Frank, 53 Crescent Street, stated that all neighborhoods will be affected by the tree problem. She stated that people are speaking about this because it is our civic responsibility. She spoke about the Japanese who planted fruit trees so that future generations will have fruit and wanted Cambridge to have a similar attitude about our trees. She asked the issue of private property be rethought. She spoke about the need for education and it could be as successful as the composting program. She stated that it may not move fast enough, but some movement is better than none. \n\nEllen Mass, President of the Friends of the Alewife Reservation, spoke about a moratorium and the awareness about trees were not in front of the public previously. She stated that this would have been a wonderful hearing to have had before the Silver Maple Forest was taken down. She stated that most of the discussion has been about the past, but she wants to discuss what is coming up. There is a situation in North Cambridge where there is a one-acre arboretum of sixty trees that were carefully planted forty years ago which is a crime waiting to happen because the two developers have misrepresented their building special permit to the Planning Board in December 2017 by leaving off the major canopy of these rare arboretum planted trees. There is a new design map, but it does not go along with what is in the tree ordinance. She stated that the tree ordinance states that a full display of the entire design must be given twenty-one days before the hearing by the Planning Board. This was not done. She stated that there was a major misrepresentation of the design which had a court yard with these arboretums. She noted that the Public Works Department is going to investigate this situation. She explained that the trees need to be removed to construct a garage underneath. \n\nErick Grunbaum, 98 Montgomery street, stated that he supports a moratorium; the tree canopy is in serious decline. He planted trees in The Port in the l990s where at the time it cost $125 to get a street tree. He stated that he sought and received a grant to subsidize this for those who could not afford to plant trees. There are massive opportunities to plant more trees. He spoke about counting the opportunities in the empty spaces in the sidewalks, not the empty tree wells, the spaces where trees can be planted. He stated that 2,500-3000 locations had been found in each of two quadrants of the City. This could yield 10,000-15,000 street trees which are the most important trees. This is what provides shade and greenery. He stated that the City needs to do a better job in investing in the canopy. He added that a short-term moratorium in reasonable. He supported more investment in the canopy, both in staffing and financing. \n\nCouncillor Kelley closed public comment at 7:17 PM.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan proposed and amendment and stated that Councillor Kelley wanted to capture the retroactive nature of the tree protection. His amendment was to change the title of section 8.66.055 to strike out the word \u201cProcedure for Other Projects\u201d and insert in place thereof the words \u201cProcedure for Other Significant Tree Removals.\u201d He further moved to amend the section by striking out the first sentence and inserting in place thereof a new sentence which reads as follows: For any significant tree removal not subject to 8.66.050, except for emergency circumstances, a permit request will first be submitted to the City Arborist. He stated that a general moratorium on tree cutting cannot be considered because it is not part of this proposal. He stated that what the committee could consider is to not issue any permits proposed in this section until the ordinance is further amended based on the recommendations of the tree task force. He stated that he wanted the committee to consider this concept. \n\nCouncillor Kelley noted that the amendment offered by Councillor Zondervan was to bring all significant trees under this section, not just those trees associated with a project. \n\nThe second suggestion was to prohibit the granting of any permits until after the tree task force finishes its work. Councillor Zondervan added that the ordinance could be amended based on their recommendations.\n\nCouncillor Kelley moved for a recess at 7:22 PM.\n\nCouncillor Kelley reconvened the hearing at 7:24 PM.\n\nCouncillor Kelley noted that there is a lot of public interest in a moratorium. He stated that another hearing can be scheduled to discuss the amendments by Councillor Zondervan and does the committee want to delay the granting of any permits which would be a defector moratorium or want to discuss a moratorium in some other fashion.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan stated that he wanted his clarifying amendments acted upon and can discuss a moratorium when the ordinance is adopted. He stated that he did not favor having another Ordinance Committee hearing and wanted this proposal to move forward to the full City Council.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux stated that she would vote in favor of the amendments offered by Councillor Zondervan and forward this to the full City Council. \n\nCouncillor Mallon stated that she was under the impression that regarding ordinance committee hearings that the committee could make something less restrictive and not more restrictive. She added that a moratorium seems more restrictive. Deputy City Solicitor Goldberg responded that this applies to zoning provisions where there has been advertised zoning language and the City Council may be trying to make significant changes to this language and there may be restrictions based on the language. He stated that this is not a zoning ordinance and the issue of restrictions does not apply. The City Council can consider something that has been advertised. He stated that the issue of these amendments has been advertised. \n\nCouncillor Kelley stated that he is uncomfortable with passing a moratorium now and does not understand the implications. He added that the moratorium was not part of the call of the hearing. He stated that when this was advertised to the public it was if you care about trees and want public notice about cutting down trees come to this hearing. This was not advertised as if you care about a moratorium come to this hearing. He stated that he feels that this is a huge difference. He stated that there can be another hearing scheduled to specifically discuss a moratorium. He stated that this is a dangerous way to go. He would vote on the amendments but would not vote to move this out of committee. \n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that he supports a moratorium but agreed with Councillor Kelley\u2019s interpretation. \n\nCouncillor Zondervan stated that the amendment he forwarded to the City Clerk does not reference a moratorium; it is just the clarifying language. He moved his amendments and stated that after amending he would move to refer to the full City Council. He stated that when the issue gets before the City Council a general moratorium could be discussed or not. Councillor Kelley stated that discussing a moratorium in the Ordinance Committee is a much better place for this discussion. He stated that he supported amending the language and keeping the matter in committee for another hearing and forwarding to the full City Council. He added that the subject of a moratorium should be the subject of a full hearing. Councillor Zondervan stated that a more general moratorium is a separate discussion and should not encumber the amendments. He is asking that the amendments be moved forward and then discuss a moratorium as part of a separate discussion.\n\nThe question now came on the amendments to change the title and the language of the first sentence in 8.66.055 submitted by Councillor Zondervan - and on a voice vote of six members the amendments -\n\nCarried.\n\nCouncillor Zondervan now moved that the amended proposal to the full City Council for further discussion. \n\nCouncillor Kelley stated that he thinks that this is a bad idea and would like to explore the idea of what a moratorium might look like.\n\nVice Mayor Devereux asked how the Ordinance Committee would discuss having a moratorium. She asked would there need to be language in front of the committee.\n\nCouncillor Kelley noted that it always best to have language before the committee.\n\nHe stated that Councillor Zondervan had an idea of making the permitting authority of the City Arborist start only when the City Council had some type of actionable things from the tree task force and if the committee met to discuss this Councillor Zondervan or anyone else could provide language for discussion. \n\nCouncillor Zondervan stated that he is suggesting that a moratorium is a general conversation and may be enacted in the way he proposed or may not, but he would prefer this conversation with the full City Council and this conversation could always be brought back to the Ordinance Committee. He stated that he did not want to delay moving this forward since there is consensus around the clarifying language. The moratorium is a separate question on whether there should be a moratorium on significant tree removals or for all trees removals. He stated that the full City Council should be part of this conversation. He stated that rather than keeping this in committee he would prefer that this amendment be forwarded to the full City Council and then the City Council can decide whether it wants to have a further conversation about a moratorium or to adopt this amendment as is or enact a moratorium differently than through this proposal. He stated that these are broader questions than his amendment which did not include language for a moratorium. \n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that the only way that the City Council could discuss a moratorium if there is a petition submitted. He asked how this would be discussed at the City Council level. City Clerk Lopez stated that this is an amendment to the Municipal Code and amendments can be made at any time. She explained that the Ordinance Committee report would go before the full City Council who could accept the report and place it on file and pass to a second reading the original proposal as amended by Councillor Zondervan.

By way of background, in 2004, the Massachusetts Legislature passed construction reform legislation that allowed Massachusetts public agencies and municipalities to use the CMaR Method for the first time. The CMaR Method has been commonly used by the private sector for some time and is an alternative to the design-bid-build approach used under M.G.L. c. 149. Since the legislation was enacted, many public entities have successfully applied for, and are using the CMaR Method.   \n  \nThe Office of the Inspector General has promulgated a set of procedures for using the CMaR Method. Once a public agency or municipality\u2019s (hereafter \u201cMunicipality\u201d) governing body authorizes the use of the CMaR Method, the Municipality submits an application to the IG, from whom the Municipality\u2019s awarding authority must obtain a notice to proceed in order to use the CMaR Method. The application requires that the Municipality demonstrate the following:  \n  \na: The Municipality has authorization from its governing body to enter into a contract with a CMaR firm.   \n  \nb: The Municipality has the capacity and a plan and procedure that is in place and approved of by the governing body, where appropriate, to effectively procure and manage CMaR services for the specific project, and has retained the services of a qualified owner\u2019s project manager.   \n  \nc: The Municipality has procedures in place to ensure fairness in competition, evaluation and reporting of results at every stage in the procurement process.   \n  \nd: The building project has an estimated construction value of $5,000,000.00 or more.  \n  \ne: The Municipality has determined that the use of the CMaR Method is appropriate for the building project and states the reasons in writing for the determination.   \n  \nThis memorandum is intended to summarize the definition, advantages, and process governing the use of the CMaR Method in support of my seeking City Council approval to utilize this construction method for the Multi-Department Relocation Plan. My submission to you of this memorandum is the first step in satisfying the above referenced requirements for seeking approval to use the CMaR Method for the Multi-Department Relocation Plan and will answer the following questions:  \n\n\n\u00b7 What is CMaR?\n\n\u00b7 What procurement and construction methods has the City used for vertical construction project in the past?\n\n\u00b7 What are some of the benefits and risks of using the CMaR Method?\n\n\u00b7 What is the timeline for the CMaR Method?\n\nWhat is Construction Management at Risk (CMaR)?  \n  \nThe CMaR is selected through a competitive procurement based on qualifications and price. The City will procure the CMaR via a two-step Request For Qualifications (\u201cRFQ\u201d) and Request For Proposal (\u201cRFP\u201d) process.  \n  \nThe type of contract the City will enter into with the CMaR is a cost plus fixed fee amount with a Guaranteed Maximum Price (\u201cGMP\u201d). The GMP is the sum of the CMaR fee, and the costs associated with the CMaR\u2019s general conditions for construction, all of the filed sub bid trade contractors, the CMaR estimates for any un-bid subcontractors at the time of the establishment of the GMP, and includes the CMaR\u2019s contingency. The CMaR agrees to pay for costs that exceed the GMP that are not the result of changes in the contract documents. This is one of the reasons a CMaR is selected prior to the plans and specifications being completed. The CMaR works with the owner and the architect to develop the scope delineated in the contract documents as part of the team.  \n  \nThe fixed fee is a percentage of the cost of the work and is submitted by the CMaR during the selection process based upon an estimated cost of construction. The CMaR\u2019s contingency belongs to the CMaR if it is needed, but is turned over to the City if not used. The contingency is a line item within the GMP and is used to incorporate missing items undefined at the time the GMP is established that arise during the project.   \n  \nBy law, the GMP cannot be established until the drawings and specifications are at a minimum of 60% complete. The closer the documents are to being 100% complete, the less the CMaR\u2019s contingency line item is. The Owner\u2019s contingency is for owner-directed changes or unforeseen conditions unknown at the time the GMP is established. The CMaR\u2019s contingency is included in the GMP; the owner\u2019s contingency is outside of the GMP.   \n  \nThe City Manager\u2019s project management staff will work closely with the City\u2019s Architect, consultants and CMaR to determine the appropriate contingencies.   \n  \nWhat procurement and construction methods has the City used for vertical construction projects in the past?  \n  \nThe City has used M.G.L. c. 149 in the past as the bidding process for vertical construction. This process, also defined as \u201cdesign-bid-build\u201d, requires all of the construction bid packages to be available only after 100% completion of the design documents. Under this traditional approach, the lowest responsible and eligible bidder is awarded the project.   \n  \nThe City has previously been approved by the IG to use the CMAR Method for the 5 Western Avenue Project, the Dr. Martin Luther King School on Putnam Avenue, the King Open/Cambridge Street Upper School and Community Complex, and the Foundry Project.   \n  \n  \n  \n\n\nWhat are some of the pros and cons of using the CMaR method?  \n  \nPros:\n\n\u00b7 The selection of the CMaR through an RFQ process allows the City to better define the specific requirements the City is looking for in a CMaR firm. The submission of defined company qualifications the presentation of these qualifications by the CMaR team to a selection committee allows for a better interaction of questions and answers to best determine the most qualified CMaR for the project.\n\n\u00b7 The selection is based upon qualifications and experience relative to specific City requirements, not the lowest price. The CMaR is selected, rather than awarded due to the lowest bid. The working relationship between the CMaR, the Owner and the architect is enhanced due to a working relationship that is developed during the process leading up to the establishment of the GMP. \n\n\u00b7 The CMaR is directly involved with the selection and management of the scope of work for the filed sub-bid trades. Because the CMaR takes the lead in defining the peripheral scope of work for staging, lifts, temporary lighting, miscellaneous patching, fire stopping, etc., scope of work disputes (a cost to the owner if they have merit) are minimized and this coordination places responsibility directly with the CMaR as the responsible party for defining each sub-bidders\u2019 drawings and specifications.\n\n\u00b7 The CMaR provides pre-construction services, which aids the City\u2019s project team with scheduling, budgeting, value engineering, phasing strategies, and constructability reviews. \n\n\u00b7 With the CMaR Method, early bid packages for demolition and abatement of hazardous materials can run concurrently while the project design is being finalized. \n\n\u00b7 The potential for change orders that occur as the result of gaps in the scopes of work as defined by the Architect is reduced because the CMaR is participating in the delineation of the scope of work during the pre-construction services. \n\n\u00b7 If the City and the selected CMaR to not come to an agreement as to the GMP, then the City has the option of bidding the project. \n\nCons:\n\n\u00b7 The CMaR Method reduces the risk for the CMaR contractor as he/she is involved early in the schematic design process. The CMaR\u2019s risk is mitigated by his/her early involvement during the design phase and his/her contingency that is established as part of the GMP.  \n\n\nThe CMaR Method reduces conflict risk between the City and the CMaR firm but that risk is minimized with an overall increased cost at the time the GMP is established.   \n  \nWhat is the timeline for the CMaR Method?  \n  \nThe first step is the CMaR Method is submission of an application to the IG.

DePasquale, City Manager, relative to a request for approval to seek authorization from the Massachusetts Office of the Inspector General (the \u201cIG\u201d) for the City to use the Construction Manager at Risk (\u201cCMaR\u201d) procurement and construction method (the CMaR Method\u201d) in connection with the Multi-Department Relocation Plan. \n\nI am writing to ask for your approval to seek authorization from the Massachusetts Office of the Inspector General (the \u201cIG\u201d) for the City to use the Construction Manager at Risk (\u201cCMaR\u201d) procurement and construction method (the CMaR Method\u201d) in connection with the Multi-Department Relocation Plan. By way of background, in 2004, the Massachusetts Legislature passed construction reform legislation that allowed Massachusetts public agencies and municipalities to use the CMaR Method for the first time. The CMaR Method has been commonly used by the private sector for some time and is an alternative to the design-bid-build approach used under M.G.L. c. 149. Since the legislation was enacted, many public entities have successfully applied for, and are using the CMaR Method.   \n  \nThe Office of the Inspector General has promulgated a set of procedures for using the CMaR Method. Once a public agency or municipality\u2019s (hereafter \u201cMunicipality\u201d) governing body authorizes the use of the CMaR Method, the Municipality submits an application to the IG, from whom the Municipality\u2019s awarding authority must obtain a notice to proceed in order to use the CMaR Method. The application requires that the Municipality demonstrate the following:  \n  \na: The Municipality has authorization from its governing body to enter into a contract with a CMaR firm.   \n  \nb: The Municipality has the capacity and a plan and procedure that is in place and approved of by the governing body, where appropriate, to effectively procure and manage CMaR services for the specific project, and has retained the services of a qualified owner\u2019s project manager.   \n  \nc: The Municipality has procedures in place to ensure fairness in competition, evaluation and reporting of results at every stage in the procurement process.   \n  \nd: The building project has an estimated construction value of $5,000,000.00 or more.  \n  \ne: The Municipality has determined that the use of the CMaR Method is appropriate for the building project and states the reasons in writing for the determination.   \n  \nThis memorandum is intended to summarize the definition, advantages, and process governing the use of the CMaR Method in support of my seeking City Council approval to utilize this construction method for the Multi-Department Relocation Plan. My submission to you of this memorandum is the first step in satisfying the above referenced requirements for seeking approval to use the CMaR Method for the Multi-Department Relocation Plan and will answer the following questions:  \n\n\n\u00b7 What is CMaR?\n\n\u00b7 What procurement and construction methods has the City used for vertical construction project in the past?\n\n\u00b7 What are some of the benefits and risks of using the CMaR Method?\n\n\u00b7 What is the timeline for the CMaR Method?\n\nWhat is Construction Management at Risk (CMaR)?  \n  \nThe CMaR is selected through a competitive procurement based on qualifications and price. The City will procure the CMaR via a two-step Request For Qualifications (\u201cRFQ\u201d) and Request For Proposal (\u201cRFP\u201d) process.  \n  \nThe type of contract the City will enter into with the CMaR is a cost plus fixed fee amount with a Guaranteed Maximum Price (\u201cGMP\u201d). The GMP is the sum of the CMaR fee, and the costs associated with the CMaR\u2019s general conditions for construction, all of the filed sub bid trade contractors, the CMaR estimates for any un-bid subcontractors at the time of the establishment of the GMP, and includes the CMaR\u2019s contingency. The CMaR agrees to pay for costs that exceed the GMP that are not the result of changes in the contract documents. This is one of the reasons a CMaR is selected prior to the plans and specifications being completed. The CMaR works with the owner and the architect to develop the scope delineated in the contract documents as part of the team.  \n  \nThe fixed fee is a percentage of the cost of the work and is submitted by the CMaR during the selection process based upon an estimated cost of construction. The CMaR\u2019s contingency belongs to the CMaR if it is needed, but is turned over to the City if not used. The contingency is a line item within the GMP and is used to incorporate missing items undefined at the time the GMP is established that arise during the project.   \n  \nBy law, the GMP cannot be established until the drawings and specifications are at a minimum of 60% complete. The closer the documents are to being 100% complete, the less the CMaR\u2019s contingency line item is. The Owner\u2019s contingency is for owner-directed changes or unforeseen conditions unknown at the time the GMP is established. The CMaR\u2019s contingency is included in the GMP; the owner\u2019s contingency is outside of the GMP.   \n  \nThe City Manager\u2019s project management staff will work closely with the City\u2019s Architect, consultants and CMaR to determine the appropriate contingencies.   \n  \nWhat procurement and construction methods has the City used for vertical construction projects in the past?  \n  \nThe City has used M.G.L. c. 149 in the past as the bidding process for vertical construction. This process, also defined as \u201cdesign-bid-build\u201d, requires all of the construction bid packages to be available only after 100% completion of the design documents. Under this traditional approach, the lowest responsible and eligible bidder is awarded the project.   \n  \nThe City has previously been approved by the IG to use the CMAR Method for the 5 Western Avenue Project, the Dr. Martin Luther King School on Putnam Avenue, the King Open/Cambridge Street Upper School and Community Complex, and the Foundry Project.   \n  \n  \n  \n\n\nWhat are some of the pros and cons of using the CMaR method?  \n  \nPros:\n\n\u00b7 The selection of the CMaR through an RFQ process allows the City to better define the specific requirements the City is looking for in a CMaR firm. The submission of defined company qualifications the presentation of these qualifications by the CMaR team to a selection committee allows for a better interaction of questions and answers to best determine the most qualified CMaR for the project.\n\n\u00b7 The selection is based upon qualifications and experience relative to specific City requirements, not the lowest price.

In order to limit the use of Surveillance Technology in Exigent Circumstances by the Police Department, Section 2.178.040 has been revised to read \u201cfor a period not to exceed 90 days.\u201d This means that for each time the Police Commissioner seeks to use Surveillance Technology in Exigent Circumstances, the use cannot exceed 90 days without getting Council approval.

The focus on the Top Tier Needs does not preclude partnerships from addressing other needs identified in the Community Needs Assessment or including services that respond to other pressing needs among families that are part of the priority population. \n\nThis process is also designed to inform future rounds of Community Benefits funding. \n\nANTICIPATED TIMELINE \n\nPlanning Grant Phase   \n---  \nNovember 2018| Release of Planning Grant RFP; Convene potential applicants on RFP, project background, relevant data, and Q &A  \nJanuary 2019| Additional convening for potential applicants, before proposals are due  \nFebruary 2019 | Planning grant proposals due to CBAC   \nMarch & April 2019 | Planning grant proposals reviewed and finalists interviewed  \nMid-April, 2019| Announce award(s) of no more than five (5) planning grants of up to $30,000 each   \nMay - November 2019 | Planning grant awardees develop Plan for Implementation   \n  \nTIMELINE Implementation Phase (tentative dates)  \n---  \nNovember 2019 | Planning grants expire and Plans for Implementation submitted to CBAC  \nDecember 2019 - January 2020| Plans for Implementation reviewed and partnerships interviewed by CBAC, evaluation team & external review committee  \nFebruary 2020 | Announce award(s) of no more than five (5) implementation grants   \nFebruary 2020 - January 2023| Plan implementation and ongoing Evaluation work  \nJanuary 2024 - December 2024| Evaluation completion   \n  \nI am pleased with the work of the Community Benefits Advisory Committee and urge your approval of the appropriation request in so that the Community Benefits funding process can move forward.\n Community Benefits Advisory Committee recommendation approp of $5,000,000"}, {"meetingdate": "2018-11-05T00:00:00.000", "meetingdescript": "City Council Regular Meeting", "meetingid": "2264", "documenttypename": "City Manager's Agenda Item", "resolutionshorttitle": "CBAC consultant service agency contract authorization", "resolutionid": "7925", "voteresultname": "ORDER ADOPTED", "voteyes": "8", "voteno": "0", "voteabstain": "0", "voteabsent": "1", "votepresent": "0", "dennis_carlone": "Yeas", "jan_devereux": "Yeas", "craig_kelley": "Absent", "alanna_mallon": "Yeas", "marc_mcgovern": "Yeas", "sumbul_siddiqui": "Yeas", "denise_simmons": "Yeas", "tim_toomey": "Yeas", "quinton_zondervan": "Yeas", "aceladescription": "\n\nI am hereby requesting that the City Council authorize the City Manager to enter into a contract with a consultant service agency to provide evaluation services for 5 years from the date of the execution of the contract pursuant to G.L. c. 30B, \u00a7 12b.

Based on that meeting and other inputs, the CPAC was provided information on project funding requests without any recommendations for percentage allocations of anticipated CPA funds. A public hearing was held on July 19, 2018, to solicit recommendations from the public on percentage allocations. The CPAC also received several petitions, letters and e-mails along with online project requests from the public relative to CPA recommendations. The CPAC, on September 5, 2018, unanimously voted for an allocation of 80% for Affordable Housing, 10% for Historical Preservation Projects and 10% for Open Space Projects.  \n  \nIn accordance with the CPAC\u2019s recommendations, I am requesting that the City Council appropriate a total of $12,730,000 in CPA funds raised by the City's FY2019 CPA surcharge, the FY2018 state match funds received in FY2019 and a portion of the existing CPA fund balance.   \n  \nFor this appropriation, it is estimated that the net local receipts from the CPA surcharge for FY2019 will total $9,400,000, added to an anticipated FY2018 state match of approximately $1,220,000 and an additional $2,100,000 from CPA Fund Balance.

For additional information, please see attachments from the CPA Committee Chair, Lisa Peterson, dated September 17, 2018.  \n  \nThe CPA process began with a public meeting held on June 13, 2018 to solicit suggestions on CPA projects for FY2019. Based on that meeting and other inputs, the CPAC was provided information on project funding requests without any recommendations for percentage allocations of anticipated CPA funds. A public hearing was held on July 19, 2018, to solicit recommendations from the public on percentage allocations. The CPAC also received several petitions, letters and e-mails along with online project requests from the public relative to CPA recommendations. The CPAC, on September 5, 2018, unanimously voted for an allocation of 80% for Affordable Housing, 10% for Historical Preservation Projects and 10% for Open Space Projects.  \n  \nIn accordance with the CPAC\u2019s recommendations, I am requesting that the City Council appropriate a total of $12,730,000 in CPA funds raised by the City's FY2019 CPA surcharge, the FY2018 state match funds received in FY2019 and a portion of the existing CPA fund balance.   \n  \nFor this appropriation, it is estimated that the net local receipts from the CPA surcharge for FY2019 will total $9,400,000, added to an anticipated FY2018 state match of approximately $1,220,000 and an additional $2,100,000 from CPA Fund Balance.

This appropriation request was developed in coordination with the Fire Chief, Public Works Commissioner and Finance Director. \n\nThe Fire Department is currently working with the Department of Public Works to establish a comprehensive deferred maintenance plan across multiple fire houses, for coordination with the Municipal Facilities Improvement Plan (MFIP) large scale alteration project schedule. \n\nThe MFIP is currently engaged in the following projects with the Fire Department: Taylor Square roof replacement, HVAC, and lighting upgrades; Fire Dept. Headquarters roof repair and replacement; Fire Dept. Headquarters Apparatus Bay ventilation; Engine 3 AC/ventilation upgrade; and a Fire and Life Safety project across 13 buildings, including five fire houses.\n\nThe Fire Chief, in collaboration with the Department of Public Works, has designated priority items for immediate repair which may include: thorough cleaning, preparation and painting of interior surfaces within the all fire stations, including the walls and ceilings on both the apparatus floor, and living quarters; repair windows, doors, and screens at all fire stations and replace two Palladian wood windows at Fire Department Headquarters; provide air conditioning using both \u201cDuctless Mini Split\u201d units or replacement of existing window air conditioning units until proper HVAC installation can be accomplished long-term; replace bathroom fixtures; provide operable cooktop ventilation, replace appliances and other repairs to kitchens; and replace or repair flooring.\n\nThe department has already initiated the purchase of assorted furnishings for firehouses including sofas and mattresses.\n\nIn addition, the City Administration annually reviews its 5-year capital and bonding plan.

DePasquale, City Manager, relative to the appropriation of $2,000,000 from Free Cash to the Public Investment Fire Department Extraordinary Expenditures to provide funds for repairs at multiple firehouses as an initial step at improving the working and living conditions within the fire stations of the City. \n\nI am hereby requesting an appropriation of $2,000,000 from Free Cash to the Public Investment Fire Department Extraordinary Expenditures to provide funds for repairs at multiple firehouses as an initial step at improving the working and living conditions within the fire stations of the City. This appropriation request was developed in coordination with the Fire Chief, Public Works Commissioner and Finance Director. \n\nThe Fire Department is currently working with the Department of Public Works to establish a comprehensive deferred maintenance plan across multiple fire houses, for coordination with the Municipal Facilities Improvement Plan (MFIP) large scale alteration project schedule. \n\nThe MFIP is currently engaged in the following projects with the Fire Department: Taylor Square roof replacement, HVAC, and lighting upgrades; Fire Dept. Headquarters roof repair and replacement; Fire Dept. Headquarters Apparatus Bay ventilation; Engine 3 AC/ventilation upgrade; and a Fire and Life Safety project across 13 buildings, including five fire houses.\n\nThe Fire Chief, in collaboration with the Department of Public Works, has designated priority items for immediate repair which may include: thorough cleaning, preparation and painting of interior surfaces within the all fire stations, including the walls and ceilings on both the apparatus floor, and living quarters; repair windows, doors, and screens at all fire stations and replace two Palladian wood windows at Fire Department Headquarters; provide air conditioning using both \u201cDuctless Mini Split\u201d units or replacement of existing window air conditioning units until proper HVAC installation can be accomplished long-term; replace bathroom fixtures; provide operable cooktop ventilation, replace appliances and other repairs to kitchens; and replace or repair flooring.\n\nThe department has already initiated the purchase of assorted furnishings for firehouses including sofas and mattresses.\n\nIn addition, the City Administration annually reviews its 5-year capital and bonding plan. This ongoing review will include the possibility of providing funding for major renovations to our fire facilities in concert with the repairs scheduled for the Taylor Square Fire Station and repairs included in the Municipal Facilities Improvement Plan (MFIP) as noted above. \n\nMajor repairs to any City Building presents challenges, including the temporary relocation of employees and services.

Mayor Alfred E. Vellucci Community Plaza\n\nAs noted above, the City acquired the land that makes up Vellucci Plaza by way of an eminent domain taking on January 21, 1980. The City Council order authorizing the taking states, in pertinent part:\n\n[T]he City of Cambridge by its City Council does hereby take the land hereinafter described for recreation open space purposes and all easements, privileges and appurtenances thereto belonging as well as all trees and all structures thereon. . . . The taking of fee simple title in land herein described is hereby authorized in accordance with General Laws, Chapter 40, Section 14 and Chapter 43, Section 30 as amended for the purpose of public recreation open space.\n\nVellucci Plaza is the primary public open space in Inman Square, with a total area of 6,480 square feet. Vellucci Plaza is adjacent to residential properties, and consists primarily of hardscape elements. The current design of Vellucci Plaza dates to 2006, when it was reconstructed as part of the larger Cambridge Street Improvements project.\n\nAs part of the community outreach for the Project, an online and email survey was conducted which included questions about the current design and use of Vellucci Plaza. Public input on Vellucci Plaza was also solicited at public meetings. There appears to be a clear consensus (350 of 441 survey responses received) that Vellucci Plaza should not \u201cstay the way it is today.\u201d Survey respondents generally indicated that Vellucci Plaza was not inviting and did not work well, in large part due to its physical isolation and disconnection from the retail activity of Inman Square (Vellucci Plaza is located on the only corner of Inman Square that does not allow for direct pedestrian access to retail).\n\n2. Inman Square Intersection Safety Improvements Project and Existing Operational and Safety Issues\n\nThe City initiated the Project in October, 2016. The purpose of the Project is to design and construct permanent physical improvements to Inman Square, which will address long-standing safety and operational issues. The Project is an outgrowth of several other studies which have been made of Inman Square in recent years, including studies by the City, and by the Massachusetts Department of Transportation in conjunction with regional pedestrian and bicycle advocacy groups.\n\nThe oblique intersection of Cambridge Street and Hampshire Street (which are two major arterial streets) contributes to operational and safety issues that have been exacerbated over the years as user volumes have increased. Conflicts between modes of transportation are of particular concern, given that Inman Square is the location of some of the highest bicycle volumes in the City (approximately 600 cyclists traverse Inman Square during a typical weekday peak hour). In addition, over 1,000 pedestrians cross the streets near Inman Square during peak hours.\n\nThe unusually large size of this intersection results in long signal cycle lengths, and lengthy delays for all users. Crosswalks are extremely long, which increases the exposure of pedestrians and cyclists to vehicle conflicts. The large number of potential turning movements resulting from Inman Square\u2019s seven entry/exit points, as well as parking maneuvers, also present many opportunities for conflicts between users.\n\nInman Square has been identified as one of the top 200 high crash locations in the Commonwealth, with a crash rate roughly double the statewide average for a signalized intersection. In addition, a high proportion of crashes in Inman Square involve pedestrians and cyclists, increasing the incidence of personal injury. Analysis of the types of crashes in Inman Square indicate that the physical configuration of the intersection of Hampshire Street and Cambridge Street is a significant contributing factor to incidents that occur there.\n\nBecause of the above factors, the City, beginning in 2016, implemented interim safety improvements in Inman Square, including prohibiting left turns and enhanced pavement markings for bike lanes, pending the completion of the current Project.\n\n3. Proposed Design and Impact on Vellucci Plaza\n\nThe proposed design for the reconfiguration of the intersection of Hampshire Street and Cambridge Street in Inman Square splits the single, unusually large, intersection into two smaller signalized intersections with more conventional geometry, and reallocates some of the existing vehicle space to pedestrian, bicycle and transit facilities. In addition, the proposed design requires that all vehicular traffic traveling through Inman Square turn and thus, increases safety and allows for better balance of the space between vehicular and non-vehicular uses. The design reduces the size of the current Vellucci Plaza, but includes the creation of a \u201cnew\u201d Vellucci Plaza on the opposite side of Hampshire Street, adjacent to existing retail uses. \n\nIn terms of usable open space and placemaking opportunities specifically, the proposed design is responsive to community opinions that Inman Square\u2019s primary open space should be located as close to retail activities as possible. A desire was expressed for a tree-shaded flexible space that could accommodate seating, informal outdoor dining, and special events, and have a lively feel. The existing Vellucci Plaza site, while somewhat compatible with these activities, was seen as disadvantaged by its location which requires pedestrians to cross one or more of Inman Square\u2019s major streets in order to be accessed from retail activities. \n\nThe construction work will result in public recreational open space existing on a portion of the current Vellucci Plaza on the west side of Hampshire Street, as well as new public recreational open space on the east side of Hampshire Street (i.e., the \u201cnew\u201d Vellucci Plaza). This new public recreational open space specifically responds to the community\u2019s desire for an attractive, flexible, open space adjacent to Inman Square\u2019s retail activity. The total area of the two resulting portions of Vellucci Plaza will be 6,480 square feet, which, as noted above, is the total area of the existing Vellucci Plaza. Thus, there will not be a net loss of recreational open space as a result of this construction work. \n\nThe City has consulted with members of Mayor Vellucci\u2019s family on the proposed design, and on May 7, 2018, the Mid-Cambridge Neighborhood Conservation District Commission approved the proposed Plaza design. \n\nHOME RULE LEGISLATION\n\nVellucci Plaza is owned and held by the City for public recreational open uses, and is therefore protected under Article 97 from any change in use absent legislation authorizing such a change in use. In order to proceed with the design of the Project and reconfiguration of the intersection of Hampshire Street and Cambridge Street and Vellucci Plaza as planned, I ask that the City Council vote in favor of filing the attached Home Rule Petition.\n\nI have attached for your information a survey plan depicting the proposed reconfiguration of the intersection of Hampshire Street and Cambridge Street as well as Vellucci Plaza, and site renderings showing the existing and proposed site conditions.\n", "full_text": " A communication transmitted from Louis A.

By way of background, in 2004, the Massachusetts Legislature passed construction reform legislation that allowed Massachusetts public agencies and municipalities to use the CMAR Method for the first time. The CMAR Method has been commonly used by the private sector for some time, and is an alternative to the design-bid-build approach used under M.G.L. c. 149. Since the legislation was enacted, many public entities have successfully applied for, and are using the CMAR method. \n\nThe Office of the Inspector General has promulgated a set of procedures for using the CMAR Method. Once a public agency or municipality\u2019s (hereafter \u201cMunicipality\u201d) governing body authorizes the use of the CMAR Method, the Municipality submits an application to the IG, from whom the Municipality\u2019s awarding authority must obtain a notice to proceed in order to use the CMAR Method. The application requires that the municipality demonstrate the following:\n\na: The Municipality has authorization from its governing body to enter into a contract with a CMAR firm. \n\nb: The Municipality has the capacity and a plan and procedure that is in place and approved of by the governing body, where appropriate, to effectively procure and manage CMAR services for the specific project, and has retained the services of a qualified owner\u2019s project manager. \n\nc: The Municipality has procedures in place to ensure fairness in competition, evaluation and reporting of results at every stage in the procurement process. \n\nd: The building project has an estimated construction value of $5,000,000.00 or more.\n\ne: The Municipality has determined that the use of the CMAR method is appropriate for the building project and states the reasons in writing the reasons for the determination. \n\nThis memorandum is intended to summarize the definition, advantages, and process governing the use of the CMAR method in support of my seeking City Council approval to utilize this construction method for the Foundry project. My submission of this memorandum to you is the first step in satisfying the above referenced requirements for seeking approval to use the CMAR Method for the Foundry and will answer the following questions:\n\n\u00b7 What is CMAR?\n\n\u00b7 What procurement and construction methods has the City used for vertical construction projects in the past?\n\n\u00b7 What are some of the benefits and risks of using the CMAR Method?\n\n\u00b7 What is the timeline for the CMAR Method?\n\nWhat is Construction Management at Risk (CMAR)?\n\nThe CMAR is selected through a competitive procurement based on qualifications and price. The City will procure the CMAR via a two-step Request for Qualifications (\u201cRFQ\u201d) and Request for Proposal (\u201cRFP\u201d) process.\n\nThe type of contract the City will enter into with the CMAR is a cost plus fixed fee amount with a Guaranteed Maximum Price (\u201cGMP\u201d). The GMP is the sum of the CMAR fee, and the costs associated with the CMAR\u2019s general conditions for construction, all of the filed sub bid trade contractors, the CMAR estimates for any un-bid subcontractors at the time of the establishment of the GMP, and includes the CMAR\u2019s contingency. The CMAR agrees to pay for costs that exceed the GMP that are not the result of changes in the contract documents. This is one of the reasons a CMAR is selected prior to the plans and specifications being completed. The CMAR works with the owner and the architect to develop the scope delineated in the contract documents as part of the team.\n\nThe fixed fee is a percentage of the cost of the work and is submitted by the CMAR during the selection process based upon an estimated cost of construction. The CMAR\u2019s contingency belongs to the CMAR if it is needed, but is turned over to the City if not used. The contingency is a line item within the GMP and is used to incorporate missing items undefined at the time the GMP is established that arise during the project. \n\nBy law, the GMP cannot be established until the drawings and specifications are at a minimum of 60% complete. The closer the documents are to being 100% complete, the less the CMAR\u2019s contingency line item is. The Owner\u2019s contingency is for owner-directed changes or unforeseen conditions unknown at the time the GMP is established. The CMAR\u2019s contingency is included in the GMP; the owner\u2019s contingency is outside of the GMP. \n\nThe City Manager\u2019s project management staff will work closely with the City\u2019s Architect, consultants and CMAR to determine the appropriate contingencies. \n\nWhat procurement and construction methods has the City used for vertical construction projects in the past?\n\nThe City has used M.G.L. c. 149 in the past as the bidding process for vertical construction. This process, also defined as \u201cdesign-bid-build\u201d, requires all of the construction bid packages to be available only after 100% completion of the design documents. Under this traditional approach, the lowest responsible and eligible bidder is awarded the project. \n\nWhat are some of the pros and cons of using the CMAR method?\n\nPros:\n\n\u00b7 The selection of the CMAR through an RFQ process allows the City to better define the specific requirements the City is looking for in a CMAR firm. The submission of defined company qualifications the presentation of these qualifications by the CMAR team to a selection committee allows for a better interaction of questions and answers to best determine the most qualified CMAR for the project.\n\n\u00b7 The selection is based upon qualifications and experience relative to specific City requirements, not the lowest price. The CMAR is selected, rather than awarded due to the lowest bid. The working relationship between the CMAR, the Owner and the architect is enhanced due to a working relationship that is developed during the process leading up to the establishment of the GMP. \n\n\u00b7 The CMAR is directly involved with the selection and management of the scope of work for the filed sub-bid trades. Because the CMAR takes the lead in defining the peripheral scope of work for staging, lifts, temporary lighting, miscellaneous patching, fire stopping, etc., scope of work disputes (a cost to the owner if they have merit) are minimized and this coordination places responsibility directly with the CMAR as the responsible party for defining each sub-bidders\u2019 drawings and specifications.\n\n\u00b7 The CMAR provides pre-construction services, which aids the City\u2019s project team with scheduling, budgeting, value engineering, phasing strategies, and constructability reviews. \n\n\u25cf With the CMAR Method, early bid packages for demolition and abatement of hazardous materials can run concurrent while the project design is being finalized. \n\n\u00b7 The potential for change orders that occur as the result of gaps in the scopes of work as defined by the Architect is reduced because the CMAR is participating in the delineation of the scope of work during the pre-construction services. \n\n\u00b7 If the City and the selected CMAR to not come to an agreement as to the GMP, then the City has the option of bidding the project. \n\nCons:\n\n\u00b7 The CMAR Method reduces the risk for the CMAR contractor as he/she is involved early in the schematic design process. The CMAR\u2019s risk is mitigated by his/her early involvement during the design phase and his/her contingency that is established as part of the GMP. \n\n\u00b7 The CMAR Method reduces conflict risk between the City and the CMAR firm as that risk is minimized with an overall increased cost at the time the GMP is established.\n\nWhat is the timeline for the CMAR Method?\n\nThe first step is the CMAR Method is submission of an application to the IG. The IG\u2019s response for approval or denial of the application is due in 60 days.\n\nSubmission of the City\u2019s application to the IG in May would mean that the IG\u2019s approval or denial would be expected in July. This timing would coincide with the programming and feasibility study presently under way by the architect Cambridge Seven Associates, Inc. The architect is scheduled to submit its feasibility study and findings to the City in September of 2018.\n\nPresently there is an assumption that some form of demolition of the Foundry building\u2019s structure and removal of hazardous materials from within the building shall be required. The CMAR process would allow for this demolition and abatement to occur in late spring of 2019 while the bid documents for the balance of the project are being prepared. \n\nI look forward to answering any questions you may have about the application and the CMAR Method that we propose to use for the redevelopment of the Foundry.\n", "full_text": " A communication transmitted from Louis A.

This project will extend the Green Line from its current terminal at Lechmere to serve seven new stations in Cambridge, Somerville, and Medford. From the Cambridge perspective, the principal benefits of this extension include the following:  \n\n\n\u00b7 Construction of a new Lechmere Station to replace the current facility, which is obsolete, in poor condition, and not fully accessible for those with disabilities.\n\n\u00b7 Creation of frequent and reliable service from sections of Somerville and Medford that are currently not easily accessible by public transportation. In addition to better serving trips to Boston that pass through Cambridge, the GLX will serve trips from these locations into the key employment centers located in eastern Cambridge.\n\n\u00b7 Assisting in meeting the City\u2019s and the region\u2019s mobility, sustainability, and economic development goals.\n\n  \nIn addition, the relocated Lechmere Station enables a number of opportunities associated with the Cambridge Crossing development, including the extension of First Street across Monsignor O\u2019Brien Highway, the creation of a new development parcel at the current location of Lechmere Station, and general improvements to access the entire site.  \n  \nBased on these multiple benefits, the City of Cambridge has long been supportive of this project, and has pushed the MBTA and MassDOT to move the project expeditiously, despite multiple delays and attempts to cancel the project.  \n  \nIn 2015, after construction on the project had commenced, the Commonwealth announced that the project was significantly over budget, and put construction on hold, pending a review of the design, cost factors, construction methods, and procurement strategy, with the goal of determining whether the project should be moved forward in a modified and less costly manner, or whether it should be cancelled despite the construction work already completed. During this review of the project, Secretary of Transportation Stephanie Pollack made it clear that she expected some level of municipal financial contribution to the project, to help offset the cost increases. Although this request was unprecedented for a public transportation project in Massachusetts, both the City of Cambridge and the City of Somerville agreed to enter into negotiations with MassDOT in order to help save the GLX as an active project.  \n  \nBased on these negotiations, which also included representatives from Divcowest, owners of the Cambridge Crossing (then Northpoint) development, Cambridge agreed to contribute $25 million dollars to the GLX project, half of which ($12.5 million) will come from contributions by DivcoWest. At the same time, Somerville agreed to contribute approximately $50 million dollars to the project, recognizing the more substantial benefit that they will realize from the project. The Boston Region Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) also agreed to reprogram the $150 million in federal funding originally intended for the next phase GLX extension to State Route 16 to help pay for the current project. Based on these financial commitments, along with changes to the design to simplify the project and reduce costs, the Commonwealth determined that it would continue to move forward with the project, subject to ongoing discussions regarding the project scope and budget.  \n  \nThe agreements between the City, MassDOT, and the MBTA were then laid out and memorialized in the attached Project Participation Agreement (PPA), which was entered into on December 14, 2016. The PPA also described the various rights and responsibilities of the parties, including a schedule of contributions, the milestones that the MBTA and MassDOT must meet, and the procedures for refunding excess municipal contributions. At the City Council meeting on September 26, 2016, the City Council authorized the City Manager to enter into this agreement and sign the PPA. A similar agreement was developed with the City of Somerville for their $50 million contribution.  \n  \nSince the signing of the PPA, the MBTA has made significant progress on the GLX project, including hiring a new Program Manager and developing a more detailed version of the design that formed the basis for the decision to move forward. The MBTA also made a decision to switch to a design-build procurement method, which should provide a greater degree of cost certainty once the contract is in place. The MBTA then developed and advertised a design-build request for proposals, and went through an extensive, multi-step process to solicit and evaluate proposals from potential design-build teams. Three proposals were received, two of which were below the maximum allowed price and were therefore fully evaluated. On November 20, 2017, the MBTA\u2019s Fiscal and Management Control Board awarded the contract to build the project to a joint venture called GLX Constructors, at a contract price of just over $1 billion, allowing the project to restart in earnest. In addition, the MBTA has created the GLX Community Working Group (CWG), which will provide a collaborative forum for information sharing between the GLX project and external stakeholders, including schedules, activities, and potential impacts associated with construction, while also soliciting stakeholder feedback. The CWG will include representatives from the City, DivcoWest, and the East Cambridge Business Association.  \n  \nAs laid out in the PPA, the first Cambridge contribution for the GLX project is due on March 1, 2018, with subsequent contributions due November 1 for each of the following four years (2019-2022); each contribution is an equal amount of $5 million. MassDOT and the MBTA have met their initial obligations under the PPA, notably having met the Start of Construction by having signed a contract and issued a Notice to Proceed to GLX Constructors and by establishing the Green Line Extension Project Cambridge Participation Expendable Trust contemplated in the PPA to receive contributions from the City of Cambridge. Based on this, we are fully expecting to need to make the initial $5 million contribution on March 1, 2018.\n", "full_text": " Transmitting Communication from Louis A.

From the Cambridge perspective, the principal benefits of this extension include the following:  \n\n\n\u00b7 Construction of a new Lechmere Station to replace the current facility, which is obsolete, in poor condition, and not fully accessible for those with disabilities.\n\n\u00b7 Creation of frequent and reliable service from sections of Somerville and Medford that are currently not easily accessible by public transportation. In addition to better serving trips to Boston that pass through Cambridge, the GLX will serve trips from these locations into the key employment centers located in eastern Cambridge.\n\n\u00b7 Assisting in meeting the City\u2019s and the region\u2019s mobility, sustainability, and economic development goals.\n\n  \nIn addition, the relocated Lechmere Station enables a number of opportunities associated with the Cambridge Crossing development, including the extension of First Street across Monsignor O\u2019Brien Highway, the creation of a new development parcel at the current location of Lechmere Station, and general improvements to access the entire site.  \n  \nBased on these multiple benefits, the City of Cambridge has long been supportive of this project, and has pushed the MBTA and MassDOT to move the project expeditiously, despite multiple delays and attempts to cancel the project.  \n  \nIn 2015, after construction on the project had commenced, the Commonwealth announced that the project was significantly over budget, and put construction on hold, pending a review of the design, cost factors, construction methods, and procurement strategy, with the goal of determining whether the project should be moved forward in a modified and less costly manner, or whether it should be cancelled despite the construction work already completed. During this review of the project, Secretary of Transportation Stephanie Pollack made it clear that she expected some level of municipal financial contribution to the project, to help offset the cost increases. Although this request was unprecedented for a public transportation project in Massachusetts, both the City of Cambridge and the City of Somerville agreed to enter into negotiations with MassDOT in order to help save the GLX as an active project.  \n  \nBased on these negotiations, which also included representatives from Divcowest, owners of the Cambridge Crossing (then Northpoint) development, Cambridge agreed to contribute $25 million dollars to the GLX project, half of which ($12.5 million) will come from contributions by DivcoWest. At the same time, Somerville agreed to contribute approximately $50 million dollars to the project, recognizing the more substantial benefit that they will realize from the project. The Boston Region Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO) also agreed to reprogram the $150 million in federal funding originally intended for the next phase GLX extension to State Route 16 to help pay for the current project. Based on these financial commitments, along with changes to the design to simplify the project and reduce costs, the Commonwealth determined that it would continue to move forward with the project, subject to ongoing discussions regarding the project scope and budget.  \n  \nThe agreements between the City, MassDOT, and the MBTA were then laid out and memorialized in the attached Project Participation Agreement (PPA), which was entered into on December 14, 2016. The PPA also described the various rights and responsibilities of the parties, including a schedule of contributions, the milestones that the MBTA and MassDOT must meet, and the procedures for refunding excess municipal contributions. At the City Council meeting on September 26, 2016, the City Council authorized the City Manager to enter into this agreement and sign the PPA. A similar agreement was developed with the City of Somerville for their $50 million contribution.  \n  \nSince the signing of the PPA, the MBTA has made significant progress on the GLX project, including hiring a new Program Manager and developing a more detailed version of the design that formed the basis for the decision to move forward. The MBTA also made a decision to switch to a design-build procurement method, which should provide a greater degree of cost certainty once the contract is in place. The MBTA then developed and advertised a design-build request for proposals, and went through an extensive, multi-step process to solicit and evaluate proposals from potential design-build teams. Three proposals were received, two of which were below the maximum allowed price and were therefore fully evaluated. On November 20, 2017, the MBTA\u2019s Fiscal and Management Control Board awarded the contract to build the project to a joint venture called GLX Constructors, at a contract price of just over $1 billion, allowing the project to restart in earnest. In addition, the MBTA has created the GLX Community Working Group (CWG), which will provide a collaborative forum for information sharing between the GLX project and external stakeholders, including schedules, activities, and potential impacts associated with construction, while also soliciting stakeholder feedback. The CWG will include representatives from the City, DivcoWest, and the East Cambridge Business Association.  \n  \nAs laid out in the PPA, the first Cambridge contribution for the GLX project is due on March 1, 2018, with subsequent contributions due November 1 for each of the following four years (2019-2022); each contribution is an equal amount of $5 million. MassDOT and the MBTA have met their initial obligations under the PPA, notably having met the Start of Construction by having signed a contract and issued a Notice to Proceed to GLX Constructors and by establishing the Green Line Extension Project Cambridge Participation Expendable Trust contemplated in the PPA to receive contributions from the City of Cambridge. Based on this, we are fully expecting to need to make the initial $5 million contribution on March 1, 2018.\n $5 million appropriation for GLX project"}, {"meetingdate": "2017-12-18T00:00:00.000", "meetingdescript": "City Council Regular Meeting", "meetingid": "1944", "documenttypename": "City Manager's Agenda Item", "resolutionshorttitle": "Special Police Officers Home Rule Legislation", "resolutionid": "6049", "voteresultname": "ORDER ADOPTED", "voteyes": "8", "voteno": "1", "voteabstain": "0", "voteabsent": "0", "votepresent": "0", "dennis_carlone": "Yeas", "jan_devereux": "Yeas", "craig_kelley": "Nays", "marc_mcgovern": "Yeas", "denise_simmons": "Yeas", "tim_toomey": "Yeas", "aceladescription": "\n\nPlease find attached a communication from Police Commissioner Branville Bard relative to proposed special legislation regarding the appointment of retired Cambridge Police Department officers as special police officers within the City of Cambridge for paid detail assignments.\n\nAfter carefully considering this matter, I believe the passage of the proposed special legislation will provide the Police Department more flexibility with filing paid detail assignments throughout the City. \n\nI recommend passage of this order and the favorable filing of the proposed special legislation with the State Legislator.\n", "full_text": " A communication transmitted from Louis A.

For additional information, please see attachments from the CPA Committee Chair, Lisa Peterson, dated September 19, 2017.\n\nThe CPA process began with a public meeting held on June 22, 2017, to solicit suggestions on CPA projects for FY2018. Based on that meeting and other inputs, the CPAC was provided information on project funding requests. A public hearing was held on July 27, 2017, to solicit recommendations from the public on percentage allocations. The CPAC also received several petitions, letters and e-mails along with online project requests from the public relative to CPA recommendations. The CPAC, on September 19, 2017, unanimously voted for an allocation of 80% for Affordable Housing, 10% for Historical Preservation Projects and 10% for Open Space Projects.\n\nIn accordance with the CPAC\u2019s recommendations, I am requesting that the City Council appropriate a total of $12,832,848 in CPA funds raised by the City's FY2018 CPA surcharge, the FY2017 state match funds received in FY2018 and a portion of the existing CPA fund balance and funds currently in the Open Space Reserve and Historic Preservation Reserve fund.\n\nFor this appropriation, it is estimated that the net local receipts from the CPA surcharge for FY2018 will total $9,000,000, added to an anticipated FY2017 state match of approximately $1,470,000 and an additional $2,100,000 from CPA Fund Balance.

DePasquale, City Manager, relative to the Community Preservation Act (CPA) recommendations for FY2018. \n\nListed below are the recommendations of the Community Preservation Act Committee (CPAC) for FY2018. For additional information, please see attachments from the CPA Committee Chair, Lisa Peterson, dated September 19, 2017.\n\nThe CPA process began with a public meeting held on June 22, 2017, to solicit suggestions on CPA projects for FY2018. Based on that meeting and other inputs, the CPAC was provided information on project funding requests. A public hearing was held on July 27, 2017, to solicit recommendations from the public on percentage allocations. The CPAC also received several petitions, letters and e-mails along with online project requests from the public relative to CPA recommendations. The CPAC, on September 19, 2017, unanimously voted for an allocation of 80% for Affordable Housing, 10% for Historical Preservation Projects and 10% for Open Space Projects.\n\nIn accordance with the CPAC\u2019s recommendations, I am requesting that the City Council appropriate a total of $12,832,848 in CPA funds raised by the City's FY2018 CPA surcharge, the FY2017 state match funds received in FY2018 and a portion of the existing CPA fund balance and funds currently in the Open Space Reserve and Historic Preservation Reserve fund.\n\nFor this appropriation, it is estimated that the net local receipts from the CPA surcharge for FY2018 will total $9,000,000, added to an anticipated FY2017 state match of approximately $1,470,000 and an additional $2,100,000 from CPA Fund Balance. Additionally, $18,750 from the Historic Preservation Reserve fund, $234,098 from the Open Space Reserve fund balance is being recommended for appropriation, and $10,000 from CPA Fund Balance for the annual membership to the Community Preservation Coalition. \n\n# On September 12 and 19, 2017, the CPAC made recommendations for allocation of these FY2018 funds.

Some contracted property appraisers have requested that the position of contracted property appraiser be designated by the City Council as a special municipal employee so that the Conflict of Interest Law will not excessively restrict their private professional activities.\n\nPursuant to G.L.c.268A, positions, not individuals, may be designated as special municipal employees by vote of the City Council if the position is part-time allowing work by the individual holding the position at another job during normal working hours; or the position is not paid by the city for more than 800 working hours during a 365 day period. The position at issue meets both of these conditions.\n\nG.L.c.268A, s.17 generally prohibits municipal employees from representing a private party before municipal boards or departments. It also prohibits municipal employees from acting as agent for a private party in connection with any matter of direct and substantial interest to their city or town.

DePasquale, City Manager, relative to a request that the City Council vote to designate the contracted part-time position of property appraiser as a special municipal employee for purposes of the state Conflict of Interest Law, G.L.c.268A.   \n  \nI request that the City Council vote to designate the contracted part-time position of property appraiser as a special municipal employee for purposes of the state Conflict of Interest Law, G.L.c.268A, by adopting the attached Order.\n\nThe City occasionally contracts with third-party property appraisers to perform appraisals for the City. For purposes of the Massachusetts Conflict of Interest Law, when the City contracts with a particular appraiser, that appraiser is considered a regular municipal employee, subject to all the Conflict of Interest Law\u2019s restrictions on regular municipal employees. If the City Council designates this position to be that of a special municipal employee, certain of the Conflict of Interest Law\u2019s restrictions would apply less broadly to such individuals, including G.L.c.268A, s.17 which pertains in part to acting as agent for third parties on matters of interest to the City, and G.L.c.268A, s.20 which pertains to having more than one contract with the same City. Some contracted property appraisers have requested that the position of contracted property appraiser be designated by the City Council as a special municipal employee so that the Conflict of Interest Law will not excessively restrict their private professional activities.\n\nPursuant to G.L.c.268A, positions, not individuals, may be designated as special municipal employees by vote of the City Council if the position is part-time allowing work by the individual holding the position at another job during normal working hours; or the position is not paid by the city for more than 800 working hours during a 365 day period. The position at issue meets both of these conditions.\n\nG.L.c.268A, s.17 generally prohibits municipal employees from representing a private party before municipal boards or departments. It also prohibits municipal employees from acting as agent for a private party in connection with any matter of direct and substantial interest to their city or town.

As initially described at that meeting, the City has agreed to make a very significant contribution to the funding of the Cambridge portions of the GLX, in the amount of $25 million. This contribution, along with additional contributions and funding allocations from municipalities and the Boston Region Metropolitan Planning Organization, will help fill the identified funding gap for the GLX, clearing the way for the project to move forward, leading to the construction of a new Lechmere Station, and opening up the full development potential of the North Point area. Separately, we are negotiating an agreement with DivcoWest (the major developers of the North Point area) regarding a contribution of $12.5 million, such that the overall Cambridge contribution would be split evenly between the City and DivcoWest.\n\nDuring the negotiations regarding the PPA, we have been able to build in a number of key provisions that protect the City\u2019s interests:\n\n\u00b7 Most critically, the PPA includes a clause that requires MassDOT to return the entire amount of the City\u2019s contribution if the relocated Lechmere Station is not open for revenue service within ten years of the start of construction. This guarantee protects the City against any future decisions to modify or cancel the project in a manner that doesn\u2019t lead to the relocation of Lechmere Station, which is the most critical outcome from our perspective (Section c.4.(a) on page 4).\n\n\u00b7 The PPA also includes a clause that suspends the City\u2019s future contributions if the project is delayed by more than six months, which both protects our financial interests and provides additional impetus for MassDOT to continue to move the project forward expeditiously (Section C.4.(b) on page 4).\n\n\u00b7 The contributions under the PPA are structured to avoid the need to appropriate funds during periods of time when the City\u2019s free cash balance is not certified by the Commonwealth following the end of the fiscal year (Section C.1. on page 3).\n\n\u00b7 The City\u2019s contributions under the PPA will be held in a separate expendable trust, and the City will be entitled to a yearly financial accounting of the status of this trust (Section B. on page 3).\n\n\u00b7 MassDOT will provide the City with regular updates on project costs and schedule (Section B.4. on page 3).\n\n  \nIn transmitting this proposed agreement, I am requesting the City Council\u2019s approval to sign this document and commit the City to contributing $25 million over the course of five years, with the first payment to be made on March 1, 2018. The document would then be held in escrow for a short period, until the City has completed negotiations relative to the contribution agreement with DivcoWest, and until it is clear that the City of Somerville has also signed a similar Project Participation Agreement, such that both contributing municipalities are agreeing to their contributions at the same time. It is important to note that the PPA includes a provision stating that if in the future the City chooses not to appropriate the funds necessary to support this agreement, MassDOT shall have the authority to demand payment of these funds through deductions from the Local Aid amount due from the Commonwealth to the City.\n\nAs members of the City Council know, the extension of the Green Line and the construction of a new Lechmere Station are critical priorities for Cambridge, and will help to support economic development and sustainable mobility.

For additional information, please see attachments from the CPA Committee Chair, Lisa Peterson, dated September 19, 2016.  \n  \nThe CPA process began with a public meeting held on June 15, 2016, to solicit suggestions on CPA projects for FY2017. Based on that meeting and other inputs, the CPAC was provided information on project funding requests without any recommendations for percentage allocations of anticipated CPA funds. A public hearing was held on July 28, 2016, to solicit recommendations from the public on percentage allocations. The CPAC also received several petitions, letters and e-mails along with online project requests from the public relative to CPA recommendations. The CPAC, on September 7, 2016, unanimously voted for an allocation of 80% for Affordable Housing, 10% for Historical Preservation Projects and 10% for Open Space Projects.  \n  \nIn accordance with the CPAC\u2019s recommendations, I am requesting that the City Council appropriate a total of $12,310,000 in CPA funds raised by the City's FY2017 CPA surcharge, the FY2016 state match funds received in FY2017 and a portion of the existing CPA fund balance.   \n  \nFor this appropriation, it is estimated that the net local receipts from the CPA surcharge for FY2017 will total $8,600,000, with an additional state match of approximately $1,600,000. In addition, $2,100,000 from CPA Fund Balance is being recommended for appropriation, plus an additional $10,000 from the Fund Balance for annual membership dues to the Community Preservation Coalition.  \n  \nOn September 7, 2016, the CPAC made recommendations for allocation of these FY2017 funds. By unanimous votes, the CPAC recommended to the City Council, through the City Manager, that the CPA funds be allocated and appropriated as follows:  \n  \nRecommended FY 2017 Allocation and Appropriation of CPA Funds   \n  \nVOTE 1: Fiscal Year 2017 Local Funds ($8,600,000)\n\n##### Vote 1A\n\n80% of FY2017 CPA Local Fund revenues ($6,880,000) allocated to Affordable Housing and appropriated to the Cambridge Affordable Housing Trust.  \n  \nVote 1B  \n10% of FY2017 CPA Local Fund revenues ($860,000) allocated to Historic Preservation as follows: \n\n1. $600,000  appropriated to the Historic Preservation Grants\n\n2. $100,000 appropriated to the Magazine Beach Powderhouse interior rehab\n\n3. $150,000  appropriated to the Brattle Street bluestone sidewalk restoration\n\n4. $10,000 appropriated to the Magazine Beach signage\n\n###### Vote 1C\n\n10% of FY2017 CPA Local Fund revenues ($860,000) allocated to Open Space as follows: \n\n1. $500,000 appropriated to the Graham and Parks School Playground \n\n2. $250,000 appropriated to the Fresh Pond Parkway Community Garden\n\n3. $110,000 appropriated to Sennott Park \n\nVOTE 2: Fiscal Year 2016 State Funds [received in FY2017] ($1,600,000)\n\n##### Vote 2A\n\n80% of FY2016 State Match revenues ($1,280,000) allocated to Affordable Housing and appropriated to the Cambridge Affordable Housing Trust.\n\n###### Vote 2B\n\n10% of FY2016 State Match revenues ($160,000) allocated to Historic Preservation as follows: \n\n1. $6,600 appropriated to Magazine Beach signage\n\n2. $60,000 appropriated to the Lowell Park landscape plan\n\n3. $30,000 appropriated to Old Burying Ground, headstone and table tomb restoration\n\n4. $63,400 appropriated to the City Clerk vault construction\n\n##### Vote 2C\n\n10% of FY2016 State Match revenues ($160,000) allocated to Open Space as follows: \n\n1. $160,000 appropriated to Sennott Park\n\n  \nVOTE 3: CPA Fund Balance ($2,100,000)\n\n##### Vote 3A\n\n80% of the Fund Balance ($1,680,000) allocated to Affordable Housing and appropriated to the Cambridge Affordable Housing Trust.\n\nVote 3B\n\n10% of the Fund Balance ($210,000) allocated to Historic Preservation as follows:\n\n1. $200,000 appropriated to the City Clerk vault construction\n\n2. $10,000 appropriated to the preservation scanning of city directories\n\nVote 3C\n\n10% of the Fund Balance ($210,000) allocated to Open Space as follows:\n\n1. $210,000 appropriated to Sennott Park\n\n  \nVOTE 4: CPA Fund Balance - Administration ($10,000)\n\nVote 4A\n\n1. $10,000 appropriated to Administrative Costs for Community Preservation Coalition Membership Dues.\n\nTable 1.

For additional information, please see attachments from the CPA Committee Chair, Lisa Peterson, dated September 19, 2016.  \n  \nThe CPA process began with a public meeting held on June 15, 2016, to solicit suggestions on CPA projects for FY2017. Based on that meeting and other inputs, the CPAC was provided information on project funding requests without any recommendations for percentage allocations of anticipated CPA funds. A public hearing was held on July 28, 2016, to solicit recommendations from the public on percentage allocations. The CPAC also received several petitions, letters and e-mails along with online project requests from the public relative to CPA recommendations. The CPAC, on September 7, 2016, unanimously voted for an allocation of 80% for Affordable Housing, 10% for Historical Preservation Projects and 10% for Open Space Projects.  \n  \nIn accordance with the CPAC\u2019s recommendations, I am requesting that the City Council appropriate a total of $12,310,000 in CPA funds raised by the City's FY2017 CPA surcharge, the FY2016 state match funds received in FY2017 and a portion of the existing CPA fund balance.   \n  \nFor this appropriation, it is estimated that the net local receipts from the CPA surcharge for FY2017 will total $8,600,000, with an additional state match of approximately $1,600,000.

The Gold Star Pool\n\nThe City\u2019s architect has completed the Schematic Design phase for the KOCSUS Project. The design for the KOCSUS Project includes reconstruction of the Gold Star Pool and moving the pool south of the existing location. The new location of the Gold Star Pool, which will be adjacent to Berkshire Street and Donnelly Field, will be beneficial to the City and the community because it allows for a larger pool and deck space, a new wading pool, and it faces south with a direct connection to Donnelly Field. The proposed new location allows better visibility from Berkshire Street and Donnelly Field. The new location is smaller than the existing location (11,773 sf verses 17,890 sf); however, it will provide a more optimized and efficient building layout for the overall Project. The new pool house and changing rooms will be located on the first level of the three story building, and the school administrative offices will be located above the pool house and changing rooms.\n\n2. Geothermal Wells\n\nThe KOCSUS Project is being designed as a Net Zero Emissions (\u201cNZE\u201d) project. The two main systems helping to facilitate that goal are photovoltaic panels (\u201cPV\u201d) which produce electricity, and the subsurface geothermal wells that provide tempered water for heating and cooling the building. The PVs are primarily on the roof and the geothermal wells will be below grade. The subsurface geothermal wells will be installed in areas that will not have any building structures above them. The new building and site design will significantly increase the green space around the Project buildings at the School Site. \n\nThe Project design requires 190 wells. They are spaced 20\u2019 apart, and even with the additional green space on the Project Site, the 190 wells cannot all fit within the existing School Site. The area outside of the School Site that is proposed for the balance of the subsurface geothermal wells is the strip of land along the northern edge of Donnelly Field between Willow and Berkshire Streets that is presently used for a seating area, basketball courts, and the Frisoli play area. In the final constructed condition, the subsurface geothermal wells and piping will reside underground and remain unseen while the disturbed surface will be restored and replaced with a new park, basketball courts and seating area. \n\nHOME RULE LEGISLATION\n\nBoth the area proposed for the construction of the subsurface geothermal wells and the Gold Star Pool are presently located in parts of the Original Donnelly Field Site, which is owned and held by the City for \u201cpublic park and park\u201d purposes and therefore is protected under Article 97 from any change in use absent legislation authorizing such a change in use. In order to proceed with the design of the Project as planned, to construct the subsurface geothermal wells within a portion of Donnelly Field and to use the Gold Star Pool Site as part of the overall site for the Project, I ask that the City Council vote in favor of filing the attached Home Rule Petition.\n\nI have attached for your information a site plan and plan attachment sheets depicting the restrictions on the existing Original Donnelly Field Site, the description of the requests and benefits of the proposed changes that are requested, site renderings showing the existing and proposed site conditions, and calculations relating to the existing and proposed pool locations at the proposed Project Site. \n", "full_text": " A communication transmitted from Richard C.

It relies on new state tax revenues derived primarily from new jobs associated with the project to pay debt service on the bonds, which are issued by the Commonwealth to fund the infrastructure. The State issues the bonds only after establishing that new state tax revenues will support the debt service. The application requests $25 million in State funding (half of the maximum amount allowed for any development project under the program) to be used to support a portion of the approximately $78 million in aggregate investment by the applicants in public infrastructure improvements in and around North Point.  \n  \nAs part of this process, City is required to hold a public hearing regarding the North Point I-Cubed proposal. A public hearing took place on Tuesday, June 14, 2016 at 7:00 pm at the Citywide Senior Center.   \n  \nBelow is a summary of what was presented at the hearing:  \n  \nRichard Rossi, City Manager for the City of Cambridge, opened the hearing by providing an overview of the I-Cubed process. He noted that the City has been closely examining this program since 2013 in terms of value and associated risks. The North Point I-Cubed proposal is a joint effort by and among EF Education First, the North Point Development Team, the City of Cambridge, and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.  \n  \nSeveral City departments have been actively involved in this process including: the City Manager\u2019s Office, City Solicitor, Finance Department, City Assessor, Community Development Department, Purchasing Agent, the Traffic, Parking and Transportation Department and the Department of Public Works. In January 2014, the City retained First Southwest, a financial consultant, and Locke Lord LLP, outside counsel, to work with City officials to analyze the benefits and potential risk to the City. The City also retained Anderson & Kreiger as outside counsel to assist in drafting and negotiating agreements with the North Point developer regarding the infrastructure improvements to be made as part of the I-Cubed process.  \n  \nRepresentatives from EF Education First and the North Point Development Team presented on the importance and benefits of the program to their plans for growth in the area. They also provided a summary of the changes and significant private investment that has occurred in North Point in recent years. It was explained that all parties involved up to this point have strong confidence in the revenue projections associated with the new developments and financial assumptions used in analyzing the program.   \n  \nSusanne Rasmussen, Director of Environment and Transportation Planning in the Community Development Department, talked about some of the important community benefits that will be gained through the infrastructure improvements: A new internal roadway network that emphasizes walking and biking and accommodates transit use, shortened distance to the Community College MBTA station through a new pedestrian link; ability to accommodate a new Lechmere MBTA Station, facilitating the conversion of automobile trips to transit trips for both commuting and all other trip purposes to North Point, the Kendall Square area, downtown Boston, and other locations along the Green Line; enhanced bicycle and pedestrian connections to the river as well as the wider regional pathway network; reconstruction of Monsignor O\u2019Brien Highway which will provide new, safer, pedestrian crossings connecting East Cambridge, Kendall Square and North Point, and allow for improved bike mobility through new grade-separated cycle tracks along the road; and the extension of First Street to Monsignor O\u2019Brien Highway which will facilitate shifting the burden of automobile traffic between Kendall Square and points north from Third Street onto First Street, which is more commercial in character.  \n  \nLouis DePasquale, Assistant City Manager for Fiscal Affairs in the City of Cambridge, reviewed financial implications and benefits of the project. He noted that the I-Cubed regulations are set up in a way that allow appropriate oversight and protections for the City and reminded the group that neither City property taxes, nor City bonds, are used to finance the program. He restated confidence in the projections used, and noted that when the cumulative revenues exceed the outstanding principal and accrued interest on the Bonds, the City\u2019s contingent obligation ends. He shared that this is currently projected to happen as early as 2023. Robert Reardon, City Assessor for the City of Cambridge, added that an Assessment Plan is required by I -Cubed regulations and that the City is allowed to assess certain North Point properties in the unlikely event of any shortfall in sales and income tax revenue, which provides additional protections for the City.   \n  \nThere were no comments from the public at this hearing, but it should be noted that presentations have been made to the East Cambridge Planning Team, and we look forward to final approval by the City Council.  \n  \nI strongly believe that this is an exceptional opportunity for the City.

I recommend that the City Council approve a 0% increase in the water consumption block rate and a 3.2% increase in the sewer use block rate, resulting in a 2.4% increase in the combined rate for the period beginning April 1, 2016 and ending March 31, 2017. This is the sixth consecutive year that the City has been able to produce a 0% increase in the water rate.   \n  \nIn last year\u2019s recommendation, the projected FY17 rate increases for water, sewer, and combined were 3.1%, 7.7%, and 6.4%, respectively, based on March 2015 consumption rates and projected budgets. We have been able to produce rates lower than estimated due primarily to lower operating budget projections in the Water Budget, and lower projected Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) assessments in the Sewer Budget. The MWRA provides annual updates to their projected assessments.   \n  \nIn March of each year, the City Council establishes water and sewer rates, which determine water and sewer revenues for the next fiscal year. Because of the timing requirements, water and sewer rates are set prior to the adoption of both the Cambridge budget and MWRA budget; therefore, revenue needs are based upon estimated expenditures. Historically, water and sewer rates have been established so that revenues generated by them, when combined with other related revenue sources, cover projected annual costs. \n\nWATER\n\nTwo major factors determine the rate necessary to generate sufficient revenues: water consumption and the budget. The total FY17 Water Budget reflects a $108,815 increase from FY16. Water is able to offset costs related to cost-of-living allowances, pensions, and health benefits in the salaries and wages portion of the operating budget with a decrease in debt service payments. \n\nThe planned FY17 capital allocation is $5,000,000 using pay-as-you-go capital funding based on current revenues ($3,500,000) and fund balance ($1,500,000). The major project in the FY17 budget is the second phase of the installation of variable frequency drives (VFDs) to the raw water pump system. An additional $1,000,000 million has been included for the replacement of existing VFDs on the finished water pumps. Installation of the VFDs will substantially improve energy efficiency at the water treatment plant. The total project cost is $5,000,000 over two years, of which $3,000,000 was funded from fund balance. The remainder of the FY17 capital allocation will be used for improvements to the distribution and transmission system, treatment plant equipment replacement, consulting services, and improvements to the watershed. Table 4 on page 5 indicates the details of water fund projected revenues and expenditures for FY16-21. Table 7 on page 8 shows actual water fund balances for FY11-15 and the projected balance for FY16.  \n  \nTo support a 0% water rate increase for the sixth year, $350,000 from fund balance will be used in FY17, bringing the total fund balance used to $1,850,000. We expect to eliminate the use of the fund balance in FY18, as decreases in debt service continue and as long as water consumption remains constant.  \n  \n\n\nWater and sewer charges are directly linked to water consumption, with sewer costs comprising approximately 71.2% of total water and sewer expenditures. When consumption declines, revenues are negatively impacted. In the current fiscal year, water is being consumed at a rate similar to the previous fiscal year. If this trend continues, this would be the second year in which consumption has not decreased.\n\n#### \n\n#### SEWER\n\nThe FY17 sewer budget reflects a 6.0% increase from FY16. This includes the MWRA assessment, debt service payments, and the sewer component of the Public Works budget. Debt service on sewer bonds and the MWRA assessment account for 90.2% of the total Sewer Budget.   \n  \nFY17 estimated sewer revenues will cover the FY17 estimated MWRA assessment, which is scheduled to increase by $639,184 from the FY16 final assessment. The MWRA rate increase projected for the City is subject to change based on the MWRA budget, which is adopted later in spring 2016. These changes have typically been minor in past years. Unlike the water budget, sewer revenues are credited to the general fund and not to a separate proprietary fund that can be drawn upon if the need arises.  \n  \nIncluded in the sewer budget are debt service increases attributable to the $12,740,000 general obligation bonds issued in February 2016 and the February 2016 SRF loan for Concord Avenue for $14,000,000.   \n  \nThe following sewer projects were included in the February 2016 bond issue: Cherry Street / South Massachusetts Avenue; Alewife Watershed; and Harvard Square projects.  \n  \nThe FY17 capital allotment of $1,000,000 in sewer revenues will continue to finance the remedial reconstruction program and development.  \n  \nThe City Council has authorized significant investments in the water and sewer systems to ensure Cambridge continues to benefit from a healthy and environmentally sound water and sewer system. In addition to the projects currently under way, the City\u2019s five-year capital plan (FY17-21) calls for an additional investment of approximately $135,663,000 (primarily sewer, $114,663,000) in the water and sewer systems. The City carefully monitors the issuance of debt to fund authorized sewer projects and makes adjustments to ensure that debt service cost increases, which impact the sewer rate, are moderate.   \n  \nSubsidies from the SRF loan program will cover only $44,240 or 0.2% of the total debt service of $19,942,737 for all FY17 sewer projects. The City will continue to receive state subsidies on existing debt. The FY18-21 capital plan includes other projects that may be eligible for subsidized loans from the state. As in past years, it is not certain that these projects will receive state subsidies and the debt service on these projects has been calculated based on funding through general obligation bonds. If state subsidies become available to the City, they will be used to lower the sewer rate in future years.

For FY16, the income guidelines are as follows: single, income of $25,197 with assets of $50,392 or less; married, income of $37,796 with assets of $69,289 or less.\n\n# FUTURE OUTLOOK FOR RATES\n\nOverall, the City has been extremely successful over the past five years in producing minimal water and sewer rate increases. The average annual increases for the FY12-16 period were as follows: water, 0.0%; sewer, 3.2%; and combined, 2.3%, which include both the water and sewer rates showing 0% increases in FY12 and FY13. The FY14, FY15 and FY16 water rate increase was also 0%.\n\nTables 4, 5, 6 and 7 contain five-year forecasts for water, sewer, and combined revenue estimates as well as water fund balances for the past five years and the projected FY16 fund balance. Although the City currently does not project the use of fund balance in the out years, it will continue to review appropriate use of fund balance for a specific project, or to lower the rate. As can be seen in Table 6, the annual combined water / sewer rate is projected to increase by an average of approximately 5.2% for FY17-21. The projected increase is the result of the City\u2019s commitment to bonding sewer infrastructure improvement projects and increases in the MWRA assessment (based on estimates received from the MWRA). MWRA increases are projected to be 1.4% - 7.1% in FY17-FY21. If increases in the MWRA assessment are more moderate, the rate increases that are shown will be lowered. If consumption increases and therefore revenues increase, rate increases will be affected positively. Conversely, if consumption decreases, there will be a negative effect on water and sewer revenues.\n\nOur water and sewer program is structured to produce reasonable rate increases in the future. The goal of the City Administration and City Council is to minimize the effects of water and sewer rate increases on residents as much as possible, while continuing to invest in our infrastructure.\n", "full_text": " A communication transmitted from Richard C. Rossi, City Manager, relative to the block rates for water consumption and sewer use for the period beginning April 1, 2016 and ending March 31, 2017. \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\nThe City administration and City Council continue to recognize the importance of minimizing increases in water and sewer rates. I recommend that the City Council approve a 0% increase in the water consumption block rate and a 3.2% increase in the sewer use block rate, resulting in a 2.4% increase in the combined rate for the period beginning April 1, 2016 and ending March 31, 2017. This is the sixth consecutive year that the City has been able to produce a 0% increase in the water rate.   \n  \nIn last year\u2019s recommendation, the projected FY17 rate increases for water, sewer, and combined were 3.1%, 7.7%, and 6.4%, respectively, based on March 2015 consumption rates and projected budgets. We have been able to produce rates lower than estimated due primarily to lower operating budget projections in the Water Budget, and lower projected Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) assessments in the Sewer Budget. The MWRA provides annual updates to their projected assessments.   \n  \nIn March of each year, the City Council establishes water and sewer rates, which determine water and sewer revenues for the next fiscal year. Because of the timing requirements, water and sewer rates are set prior to the adoption of both the Cambridge budget and MWRA budget; therefore, revenue needs are based upon estimated expenditures. Historically, water and sewer rates have been established so that revenues generated by them, when combined with other related revenue sources, cover projected annual costs. \n\nWATER\n\nTwo major factors determine the rate necessary to generate sufficient revenues: water consumption and the budget. The total FY17 Water Budget reflects a $108,815 increase from FY16. Water is able to offset costs related to cost-of-living allowances, pensions, and health benefits in the salaries and wages portion of the operating budget with a decrease in debt service payments. \n\nThe planned FY17 capital allocation is $5,000,000 using pay-as-you-go capital funding based on current revenues ($3,500,000) and fund balance ($1,500,000). The major project in the FY17 budget is the second phase of the installation of variable frequency drives (VFDs) to the raw water pump system. An additional $1,000,000 million has been included for the replacement of existing VFDs on the finished water pumps. Installation of the VFDs will substantially improve energy efficiency at the water treatment plant. The total project cost is $5,000,000 over two years, of which $3,000,000 was funded from fund balance. The remainder of the FY17 capital allocation will be used for improvements to the distribution and transmission system, treatment plant equipment replacement, consulting services, and improvements to the watershed. Table 4 on page 5 indicates the details of water fund projected revenues and expenditures for FY16-21. Table 7 on page 8 shows actual water fund balances for FY11-15 and the projected balance for FY16.  \n  \nTo support a 0% water rate increase for the sixth year, $350,000 from fund balance will be used in FY17, bringing the total fund balance used to $1,850,000. We expect to eliminate the use of the fund balance in FY18, as decreases in debt service continue and as long as water consumption remains constant.  \n  \n\n\nWater and sewer charges are directly linked to water consumption, with sewer costs comprising approximately 71.2% of total water and sewer expenditures. When consumption declines, revenues are negatively impacted. In the current fiscal year, water is being consumed at a rate similar to the previous fiscal year. If this trend continues, this would be the second year in which consumption has not decreased.\n\n#### \n\n#### SEWER\n\nThe FY17 sewer budget reflects a 6.0% increase from FY16. This includes the MWRA assessment, debt service payments, and the sewer component of the Public Works budget. Debt service on sewer bonds and the MWRA assessment account for 90.2% of the total Sewer Budget.   \n  \nFY17 estimated sewer revenues will cover the FY17 estimated MWRA assessment, which is scheduled to increase by $639,184 from the FY16 final assessment. The MWRA rate increase projected for the City is subject to change based on the MWRA budget, which is adopted later in spring 2016. These changes have typically been minor in past years. Unlike the water budget, sewer revenues are credited to the general fund and not to a separate proprietary fund that can be drawn upon if the need arises.  \n  \nIncluded in the sewer budget are debt service increases attributable to the $12,740,000 general obligation bonds issued in February 2016 and the February 2016 SRF loan for Concord Avenue for $14,000,000.   \n  \nThe following sewer projects were included in the February 2016 bond issue: Cherry Street / South Massachusetts Avenue; Alewife Watershed; and Harvard Square projects.  \n  \nThe FY17 capital allotment of $1,000,000 in sewer revenues will continue to finance the remedial reconstruction program and development.  \n  \nThe City Council has authorized significant investments in the water and sewer systems to ensure Cambridge continues to benefit from a healthy and environmentally sound water and sewer system. In addition to the projects currently under way, the City\u2019s five-year capital plan (FY17-21) calls for an additional investment of approximately $135,663,000 (primarily sewer, $114,663,000) in the water and sewer systems. The City carefully monitors the issuance of debt to fund authorized sewer projects and makes adjustments to ensure that debt service cost increases, which impact the sewer rate, are moderate.   \n  \nSubsidies from the SRF loan program will cover only $44,240 or 0.2% of the total debt service of $19,942,737 for all FY17 sewer projects. The City will continue to receive state subsidies on existing debt. The FY18-21 capital plan includes other projects that may be eligible for subsidized loans from the state. As in past years, it is not certain that these projects will receive state subsidies and the debt service on these projects has been calculated based on funding through general obligation bonds. If state subsidies become available to the City, they will be used to lower the sewer rate in future years.

Vendors will make this certification on behalf of themselves and any subcontractors they plan to use in performance of their contract with the City.   \n  \nThis Executive Order furthers the City\u2019s ongoing commitment to wage justice, and I am hopeful that it will help support workers in protecting against wage theft.\n Wage Theft Executive Order"}, {"meetingdate": "2016-03-14T00:00:00.000", "meetingdescript": "City Council Regular Meeting", "meetingid": "1556", "documenttypename": "City Manager's Agenda Item", "resolutionshorttitle": "AAA ratings from the three major credit rating agencies", "resolutionid": "2112", "voteresultname": "PLACED ON FILE", "voteyes": "8", "voteno": "0", "voteabstain": "0", "voteabsent": "1", "votepresent": "0", "dennis_carlone": "Absent", "jan_devereux": "Yeas", "craig_kelley": "Yeas", "marc_mcgovern": "Yeas", "denise_simmons": "Yeas", "tim_toomey": "Yeas", "aceladescription": "\n\nI am pleased to inform you, the taxpayers, and all our residents that the City of Cambridge has retained its noteworthy distinction of being one of approximately 36 municipalities in the United States with AAA ratings from each of the nation\u2019s three major credit rating agencies.

Denise Simmons\n\nThe Finance Committee, comprised of the entire membership of the City Council, conducted a public hearing on March 3, 2016 at 5:06 PM in the Ackermann Room.\n\nThe purpose of the hearing was to discuss the FY 16 budget and the FY 17 budget process. Vice Mayor McGovern announced that the meeting is being privately audio recorded.\n\nPresent at the hearing were Vice Mayor McGovern, Chair of the Committee, \n\nCouncillor Carlone, Councillor Cheung, Councillor Kelley, Councillor Maher, Councillor Mazen, Councillor Toomey, Mayor Simmons, City Manager Richard Rossi, Deputy City Manager Lisa Peterson, Assistant City Manager for Fiscal Affairs Louis DePasquale, Ellen Semonoff, Assistant City Manager for Human Service Programs, Iram Farooq, Assistant City Manager for Community Development, Budget Director Jeana Franconi, Nancy Glowa, City Solicitor, Robert Haas, Commissioner of Police, Ellen Semonoff, Owen O'Riordan, Public Words Commissioner, Lee Gianetti, Director of Communications and Community Relations and City Clerk Donna P. Lopez.\n\nAlso present were John Hawkinson, 84 Massachusetts Avenue and Hasson Rashid, 820 Massachusetts Avenue.\n\nVice Mayor McGovern opened the hearing and explained the purpose. The meeting was the result of Policy Order # 9 dated January 25, 2016 (ATTACHMENT A) to discuss goals as they relate to the current budget and the FY17 budget.\n\nCity Manager Rossi spoke about the FY16 budget as it rolls into FY17 budget. He stated that the preparation of the budget is a top priority for a city manager as it affects the entire City. He explained that 80% of the budget costs are fixed costs which is where the budget starts from. It is no secret that Cambridge has high property values. All the departmental initiatives grow the budget in a positive way. Policy related issues are taken into consideration as well as the state budget. The budget process takes twelve months. Mr. Rossi stated that in Cambridge the budget is incredible. The police, fire and human services provided in the City has come about as joint effort with the city manager, city departments and the community.\n\nCouncillor Cheung noted that City Council committees have goal setting meetings. What is the goal of this meeting? Councillor Carlone stated that because goals were not set last term the budget is not affected. Councillor Cheung stated that he had meetings to develop goals for his committees and they roll up into the Government Operations, Rules and Claims Committee. \n\nMr. Rossi explained the process. He stated that the City Manager is responsible for preparing the budget and is impacted in many ways. A goal setting exercised is needed between the City Council and the City Manager. He stated that goals need to be broad but tell the story of where the City wants to go. \n\nVice Mayor McGovern gave an example. He is interested in having a shower bus for the homeless and would love for Cambridge to have this. Where does he go for this to be in the budget? Mr. Rossi explained that this is the type of thing that the City Manager and his team determine how this will be done. He cannot prepare a budget on the requests of nine different people; he cannot fund everyone's great ideas. Councillor Cheung explained his request for more money and governance for the IT budget; which took multiple years and this translated into budgetary money. Mr. Rossi stated that this needed a bigger process and this budget was increased over a long term process. \n\nCouncillor Mazen stated that the whole finance-City Manager team does a great job to provide a budget package. He spoke about balance between specificity and implementation. Mr. Rossi stated that from a policy point of view initiatives will come out in the committee process rather than by a policy order. The IT process was a more public facing process. Councillor Mazen noted that two major factors of the budget process that will indicate success. They are the latitude to cut spending based on discussions with the City Council to make some fiscal decision moving forward and the other is that the City Council would come together to establish projects which may not be a priority and to take a consensus list to give guidance to the City Manager. Mr. Rossi stated that in the end that he has to make a decision. He added that the personnel who run the city departments are the experts and he makes his budget based on this input and on the input of the City Council. Councillor Mazen stated that if this is done as package the City Manager can tell what can be done on this list. Mr. Rossi stated that this budget meets the needs of the community.\n\nVice Mayor McGovern commented that when Plan E is questioned the system works because of the checks and balances in place. He asked how can the City Council have an impact and have input into the budget process. Mr. Rossi responded that the majority of the increase in the city budget comes from the City Council. He stated that the needs of the community are great. \n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that he felt frustrated by the budget process. The City Council had little input. There is a 5-10 year plan and fixed costs due to salaries. He stated that more money needs to be put into affordable housing and that the childcare strategy makes sense. The City Council general goals is what the budget is based on and they are not very objective. Mr. Rossi noted that this is within the City Council's purview. This makes it easier for the City Manager to interpret. He explained that the City Manager has to have a balanced budget, fill the needs and protect the City. The City Council's responsibility is to adopt and approve the budget. The City Council can reject the budget or add to the budget. Councillor Carlone asked if the City Council is really involved in the budget process. He wanted a list of infrastructure project or housing projects so that he can digest this information. Mr. Rossi stated that the City Council is underestimating what impact the City Council has in the budgetary process.\n\nCouncillor Cheung stated that this debate is around the micro versus the macro issues. The City Council has to ensure that the City Manager is hiring competent employees. All the micro issues will wipe out the macro issues. Mr. Rossi spoke about a Policy Order that requires a study and the amount of work and time that is spent on unreal issues. He spoke about the time drain on employees is hard on everyone. Councillor Cheung noted that macro stuff is being done well. He explained that he asked how to effect the IT budget and that he followed the instructions given by the City Manager. The City Charter is set up to limit the power of the City Council and the City Council has diluted power and there is currently more transparency. \n\nVice Mayor McGovern applauded the City staff and employees who work for the city. He added that the City Council has to be respectful of the City Manager's time and it is hard for an elected official to respond to a constituent that they cannot help them. Mr. Rossi explained that things that are not feasible may not go forward.\n\nCouncillor Mazen stated that the productive tension is the balance of what is appropriate. The process needs flexibility and needs input from the City Council. The City Council can get behind the budget and he wanted more leeway to create a budget that all are happy with. City Manager Rossi stated that this is not the way it works. It is his responsibility to prepare a budget. Councillor Mazen suggested that the preparation of the budget with City Council input may cause delay. Mr. Rossi stated that the City Council input is in the goal setting session. He stated that the laws on the budget must be read; they are written to protect the public. He cautioned about the loss of state aid. Councillor Mazen wanted consensus building so that there is input into the budget and asked how the goal setting sessions make their way into the budget process. Councillor Cheung informed the committee that he wanted participatory budgeting and there was a Finance Committee hearing and now Cambridge has participatory budgeting. \n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that his frustration is that the goal setting process was unproductive. Mr. Rossi stated that for goal setting process the city will hire a consultant to hear what the City Council wants and then the consultant will have a feeling of how things were done. \n\nVice Mayor McGovern stated that the School Department has guidelines which lists the values that have to be in the budget. Mr. Rossi stated that this is done on a departmental level all the time. Vice Mayor McGovern asked if it would be more helpful if the City Council meet and listed things they wanted in the budget. Councillor Carlone stated that he wanted more clarity on the impact. Councillor Mazen wanted to make the process easier with less pain. \n\nVice Mayor McGovern stated that Cambridge is in the envy of all other communities. \n\nCouncillor Cheung stated that he does not want to hire a consultant. The City Council can have committee hearings and report out overarching goals. Councillor Mazen stated that doing this in committees has too many moving parts. Councillor Cheung noted that there has been consistency in finding money in the budget for emergency needs. \n\nMr. Rossi explained the process when an idea is brought to him. Councillor Carlone spoke about City Council consensus. Mr. Rossi stated it is a good idea; but it is one on a list of good ideas. Councillor Mazen spoke about developing a patter for the City Council on what works and does not work. These discussion need to be before the City Council.\n\nAt this time Assistant City Manager for Fiscal Affairs, Mr. DePasquale, gave an update on the FY 16. He stated that the City Council is not giving themselves credit for the impact the City Council has on the budget. The budget process development takes a lot of time. The budget has grown 25 positions and it will increase in FY17. Mr. Rossi stated that this is due to the increase in programing. Mitigation funds has been purposed in the community and the money is helping nonprofits. Mr. Rossi stated that he is hearing that early childcare is only a City issue and he wanted the City Council to respond to this comment when they meet with the School Committee. He spoke about the City initiatives created by the City Council: such as STEAM, vulnerability assessment and early childcare. \n\nPublic Works Commissioner O'Riordan stated that there was a capital meeting held on street reconstruction. For FY15 $8 million was allocated; this year $4 million is allocated. He stated that in FY15 budget hearing heard about the problem of tree wells and money was put into budget to deal with this as well as funding for truck barriers; street clean and recycling. Mr. Rossi added that Net Zero is a big cost to the City.\n\nMs. Semonoff stated that second position was added DHSP for civic engagement. Funding was expanded for legal services for eviction protection and for food pantries. She stated that Baby U was created from a request from the City Council; transitional jobs program was also grown from a City Council request.\n\nCommissioner Haas spoke about providing services for the most vulnerable and this is done by collaboration with many City departments. He stated that the work with youth has shown that there is a decrease in juvenile arrest. He spoke about the work with the elderly. Police work has been acknowledged nationally. He explained that 93.8% of his budget is salaries. He has two social workers on staff; this is not seen in other police departments.

Lopez, City Clerk, transmitting a report from Vice Mayor Marc C. McGovern, Chair of the Finance Committee, for a public hearing held on March 3, 2016 to discuss the FY16 Budget and the FY17 budget process.   \n  \nFINANCE COMMITTEE MEMBERS\n\nVice Mayor Marc C. McGovern, Chair\n\nCouncillor Dennis J. Carlone\n\nCouncillor Leland Cheung\n\nCouncillor Jan Devereux\n\nCouncillor Craig Kelley\n\nCouncillor David P. Maher\n\nCouncillor Nadeem A. Mazen\n\nCouncillor Timothy J. Toomey, Jr.\n\nMayor E. Denise Simmons\n\nThe Finance Committee, comprised of the entire membership of the City Council, conducted a public hearing on March 3, 2016 at 5:06 PM in the Ackermann Room.\n\nThe purpose of the hearing was to discuss the FY 16 budget and the FY 17 budget process. Vice Mayor McGovern announced that the meeting is being privately audio recorded.\n\nPresent at the hearing were Vice Mayor McGovern, Chair of the Committee, \n\nCouncillor Carlone, Councillor Cheung, Councillor Kelley, Councillor Maher, Councillor Mazen, Councillor Toomey, Mayor Simmons, City Manager Richard Rossi, Deputy City Manager Lisa Peterson, Assistant City Manager for Fiscal Affairs Louis DePasquale, Ellen Semonoff, Assistant City Manager for Human Service Programs, Iram Farooq, Assistant City Manager for Community Development, Budget Director Jeana Franconi, Nancy Glowa, City Solicitor, Robert Haas, Commissioner of Police, Ellen Semonoff, Owen O'Riordan, Public Words Commissioner, Lee Gianetti, Director of Communications and Community Relations and City Clerk Donna P. Lopez.\n\nAlso present were John Hawkinson, 84 Massachusetts Avenue and Hasson Rashid, 820 Massachusetts Avenue.\n\nVice Mayor McGovern opened the hearing and explained the purpose. The meeting was the result of Policy Order # 9 dated January 25, 2016 (ATTACHMENT A) to discuss goals as they relate to the current budget and the FY17 budget.\n\nCity Manager Rossi spoke about the FY16 budget as it rolls into FY17 budget. He stated that the preparation of the budget is a top priority for a city manager as it affects the entire City. He explained that 80% of the budget costs are fixed costs which is where the budget starts from. It is no secret that Cambridge has high property values. All the departmental initiatives grow the budget in a positive way. Policy related issues are taken into consideration as well as the state budget. The budget process takes twelve months. Mr. Rossi stated that in Cambridge the budget is incredible. The police, fire and human services provided in the City has come about as joint effort with the city manager, city departments and the community.\n\nCouncillor Cheung noted that City Council committees have goal setting meetings. What is the goal of this meeting? Councillor Carlone stated that because goals were not set last term the budget is not affected. Councillor Cheung stated that he had meetings to develop goals for his committees and they roll up into the Government Operations, Rules and Claims Committee. \n\nMr. Rossi explained the process. He stated that the City Manager is responsible for preparing the budget and is impacted in many ways. A goal setting exercised is needed between the City Council and the City Manager. He stated that goals need to be broad but tell the story of where the City wants to go. \n\nVice Mayor McGovern gave an example. He is interested in having a shower bus for the homeless and would love for Cambridge to have this. Where does he go for this to be in the budget? Mr. Rossi explained that this is the type of thing that the City Manager and his team determine how this will be done. He cannot prepare a budget on the requests of nine different people; he cannot fund everyone's great ideas. Councillor Cheung explained his request for more money and governance for the IT budget; which took multiple years and this translated into budgetary money. Mr. Rossi stated that this needed a bigger process and this budget was increased over a long term process. \n\nCouncillor Mazen stated that the whole finance-City Manager team does a great job to provide a budget package. He spoke about balance between specificity and implementation. Mr. Rossi stated that from a policy point of view initiatives will come out in the committee process rather than by a policy order. The IT process was a more public facing process. Councillor Mazen noted that two major factors of the budget process that will indicate success. They are the latitude to cut spending based on discussions with the City Council to make some fiscal decision moving forward and the other is that the City Council would come together to establish projects which may not be a priority and to take a consensus list to give guidance to the City Manager. Mr. Rossi stated that in the end that he has to make a decision. He added that the personnel who run the city departments are the experts and he makes his budget based on this input and on the input of the City Council. Councillor Mazen stated that if this is done as package the City Manager can tell what can be done on this list. Mr. Rossi stated that this budget meets the needs of the community.\n\nVice Mayor McGovern commented that when Plan E is questioned the system works because of the checks and balances in place. He asked how can the City Council have an impact and have input into the budget process. Mr. Rossi responded that the majority of the increase in the city budget comes from the City Council. He stated that the needs of the community are great. \n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that he felt frustrated by the budget process. The City Council had little input. There is a 5-10 year plan and fixed costs due to salaries. He stated that more money needs to be put into affordable housing and that the childcare strategy makes sense. The City Council general goals is what the budget is based on and they are not very objective. Mr. Rossi noted that this is within the City Council's purview. This makes it easier for the City Manager to interpret. He explained that the City Manager has to have a balanced budget, fill the needs and protect the City. The City Council's responsibility is to adopt and approve the budget. The City Council can reject the budget or add to the budget. Councillor Carlone asked if the City Council is really involved in the budget process. He wanted a list of infrastructure project or housing projects so that he can digest this information. Mr. Rossi stated that the City Council is underestimating what impact the City Council has in the budgetary process.\n\nCouncillor Cheung stated that this debate is around the micro versus the macro issues. The City Council has to ensure that the City Manager is hiring competent employees. All the micro issues will wipe out the macro issues. Mr. Rossi spoke about a Policy Order that requires a study and the amount of work and time that is spent on unreal issues. He spoke about the time drain on employees is hard on everyone. Councillor Cheung noted that macro stuff is being done well. He explained that he asked how to effect the IT budget and that he followed the instructions given by the City Manager. The City Charter is set up to limit the power of the City Council and the City Council has diluted power and there is currently more transparency. \n\nVice Mayor McGovern applauded the City staff and employees who work for the city. He added that the City Council has to be respectful of the City Manager's time and it is hard for an elected official to respond to a constituent that they cannot help them. Mr. Rossi explained that things that are not feasible may not go forward.\n\nCouncillor Mazen stated that the productive tension is the balance of what is appropriate. The process needs flexibility and needs input from the City Council. The City Council can get behind the budget and he wanted more leeway to create a budget that all are happy with. City Manager Rossi stated that this is not the way it works. It is his responsibility to prepare a budget. Councillor Mazen suggested that the preparation of the budget with City Council input may cause delay. Mr. Rossi stated that the City Council input is in the goal setting session. He stated that the laws on the budget must be read; they are written to protect the public. He cautioned about the loss of state aid. Councillor Mazen wanted consensus building so that there is input into the budget and asked how the goal setting sessions make their way into the budget process. Councillor Cheung informed the committee that he wanted participatory budgeting and there was a Finance Committee hearing and now Cambridge has participatory budgeting. \n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that his frustration is that the goal setting process was unproductive. Mr. Rossi stated that for goal setting process the city will hire a consultant to hear what the City Council wants and then the consultant will have a feeling of how things were done. \n\nVice Mayor McGovern stated that the School Department has guidelines which lists the values that have to be in the budget. Mr. Rossi stated that this is done on a departmental level all the time. Vice Mayor McGovern asked if it would be more helpful if the City Council meet and listed things they wanted in the budget. Councillor Carlone stated that he wanted more clarity on the impact. Councillor Mazen wanted to make the process easier with less pain. \n\nVice Mayor McGovern stated that Cambridge is in the envy of all other communities. \n\nCouncillor Cheung stated that he does not want to hire a consultant. The City Council can have committee hearings and report out overarching goals. Councillor Mazen stated that doing this in committees has too many moving parts. Councillor Cheung noted that there has been consistency in finding money in the budget for emergency needs. \n\nMr. Rossi explained the process when an idea is brought to him. Councillor Carlone spoke about City Council consensus. Mr. Rossi stated it is a good idea; but it is one on a list of good ideas. Councillor Mazen spoke about developing a patter for the City Council on what works and does not work. These discussion need to be before the City Council.\n\nAt this time Assistant City Manager for Fiscal Affairs, Mr. DePasquale, gave an update on the FY 16. He stated that the City Council is not giving themselves credit for the impact the City Council has on the budget. The budget process development takes a lot of time. The budget has grown 25 positions and it will increase in FY17. Mr. Rossi stated that this is due to the increase in programing. Mitigation funds has been purposed in the community and the money is helping nonprofits. Mr. Rossi stated that he is hearing that early childcare is only a City issue and he wanted the City Council to respond to this comment when they meet with the School Committee. He spoke about the City initiatives created by the City Council: such as STEAM, vulnerability assessment and early childcare. \n\nPublic Works Commissioner O'Riordan stated that there was a capital meeting held on street reconstruction. For FY15 $8 million was allocated; this year $4 million is allocated. He stated that in FY15 budget hearing heard about the problem of tree wells and money was put into budget to deal with this as well as funding for truck barriers; street clean and recycling. Mr. Rossi added that Net Zero is a big cost to the City.\n\nMs. Semonoff stated that second position was added DHSP for civic engagement. Funding was expanded for legal services for eviction protection and for food pantries. She stated that Baby U was created from a request from the City Council; transitional jobs program was also grown from a City Council request.\n\nCommissioner Haas spoke about providing services for the most vulnerable and this is done by collaboration with many City departments. He stated that the work with youth has shown that there is a decrease in juvenile arrest. He spoke about the work with the elderly. Police work has been acknowledged nationally. He explained that 93.8% of his budget is salaries. He has two social workers on staff; this is not seen in other police departments. We are building and working towards a healthier community. \n\nMr. Rossi spoke about the Law Department budget working to provide better process on enforcement. He added that the City Clerk's has a great computer system and will be an advanced City Clerk's Office in the years to come.\n\nAssistant City Manager for Community Development, Iram Farooq, spoke about the $3.3 million allocated for planning.

She convened the hearing and explained the purpose. She outlined the format of the hearing. She noted that if comments were submitted by e-mail that they would be made part of the record. She then invited the petitioner to come forward.\n\nPetition\n\nThe City Council heard from the petitioner, Mr. Peter L. Cohen, 11 Donnell Street. He stated that he wanted to amend the zoning ordinance in a very modest way that is important to him and his family. He spoke about his neighborhood. The neighborhood contains modest two family houses, a few single family houses and a few triple deckers. His neighbors are friendly, but not intrusive. There is a sense of neighborhood. There are young families with children in the neighborhood. He noted that the scale and architecture of the homes in the neighborhood are located close to and face the street. Most homes have off street parking and there are a few garages which are separate structures tucked behind the homes. He stated that the exceptions are 10 and 12 Donnell Street have garages that were built into the main structure facing the street in a townhouse style. He further stated that 7B and 7C Donnell Street have a garage facing the street as part of the condominium structure but is located down a driveway and 50 feet from the street. He explained that in his residential neighborhood there are no residential units, old or new, with a garage facing the street. He did not want the urban landscape to change except when there is a compelling reason. He explained why this is an issue to build a structure where the main feature facing the street is a garage. Economic pressures could dictate an outcome that may alienate the neighborhood. He stated that he lives next to property that is the subject of redevelopment. He added that there are other non-conforming lots that can be rezoned and will over time will be subject to the same redevelopment pressures and bad outcome. The amendment that he drafted applies to other properties and commented about unintended consequences. He spoke about the 9 Donnell Street which is the subject of the amendment which is a two family worker's cottage built in the l850's. Mr. Cohen proceeded with his presentation \n\nHe stated that the house at 9 Donnell Street is relatively small with a two car garage on a lot that is 6,000 square feet. This property was owned for sixty years by one owner but recently is in the hands of a developer. Because of the narrowness of the lot there is a push to remove the existing house. The current owner has brought the proposal to the Planning Board which has approved the proposal in principal which would have two different structures in the style of a townhouse, with a courtyard in the middle with underground parking underneath. The neighbors were told by the property owners that there is an alternative and they can build by right one long structure with a garage structure in front, view I is what the structure would look like from the street. It is his understanding that this is what the developer wants to build on the site with Planning Board approval. During the Planning Board hearing the Planning Board members questioned whether the development was economically viable. He stated that the zoning could be amended to prohibit this or the Planning Board could grant a special permit. He wanted to get ahead of this situation before the structure is built. He depicted a reasonable development that has a garage. He spoke about the technical and spiritual aspects of this proposal. He stated that 101 Orchard Street depicts frontage of a house and a garage. This amendment would only effect a narrow group of properties that are dimensional non-conforming lots where there is a garage. He spoke of the law of unintended consequences. He commented that developers are looking at lots as an economic proposition. He wanted development done in a tasteful way that does not upset neighborhood values. He stated that within the first 50 feet of land a garage should not be built, but could apply to the Planning Board for a special permit. He explained the structure of his petition. He stated that Section B (2) of his petition deals with demolition during the pendency period of the special permit application and covers historical signification properties that are being torn down. This will codify the current practice. Mr. Cohen stated that Section C deals with if the petition is challenged by developers and struck down this would just prohibit garages in the front 50 feet. He spoke about the memo written by Community Development start. He stated that language in his petition needs to be clarified. It is not the intention to prohibit parking rather where parking is put. He wanted to find a balance for the neighborhood and developer with neighborhood values being primary. He noted that the language in his petition needs refinement.\n\nPeter L.

A communication was received from Donna P. Lopez, City Clerk, transmitting information on the Cohen Zoning Petition - Legal Ad.\n\nCOF 2016 # 5\n\n3.

He stated that the Planning Board will hear the petition on March 8. The memo contains an overview of the petition. The full impact of the petition have not been fully studied and Residence B is a common zoning district which contains about 4,000 lots and have not studied how many of these lots are non-conforming. It is not typical for lots to be narrower than the 50 foot lot width. In the current zoning ordinance between Articles Five and Six there are a set of different requirements pertaining to parking facilities, both in structured parking facilities such as garages as well as surface parking. There are restrictions currently in place for smaller lots and there is more flexibility. The issue raised with this proposal is the balance between the requirement that housing when created has to provide parking at one space per unit and must meet the dimensional requirement in the zoning verses having additional restrictions that would limit where the parking is allowed to go and be designed on the lot. Relief is sought by a special permit from the Planning Board or variance from the Board of Zoning Appeal. Mr. Roberts added that the petitioner did not some of the technical points made. One is that the proposed provision is cited in Article Ten, the procedures section, of the zoning. What is being proposed is more of a development control and belongs in Article 5 of the zoning. He commented on the terminology of multi-family which is standard term in zoning and building codes that refers to three units or more. Sections B and C in the petition that discusses procedures for special permit relief provisions are unusual compared to the way that special permits are typically provided for in the zoning. When there is a special permit provision there is criteria cited and if the Planning Board or BZA finds that the project meets the zoning requirements and the criteria outlined in the zoning then the special permit will be granted; variances require proving hardship to have the zoning requirement relieved. These provisions if passed needs to be reviewed to determine the legal appropriateness of the language.\n\nPeter L. Cohen, et al., Zoning Petition - Community Development Memo.\n\nPublic Comment\n\nAt this time Mayor Simmons opened the hearing to public comment.\n\nCharles Teague, 23 Edmonds Street, stated that he is the project manager for the lot that is the target of this petition. He noted that this project is targeted because it is next door to Attorney Cohen. He stated that this petition is illegal. He noted that for Part A there is a letter from the trustee of 9 Donnell Street, Mr. Robert McHale has been sent to the City Council and is written protest to the petition ([COMMUNICATION #3](http://cambridgema.iqm2.com/Citizens/Detail_LegiFile.aspx?Frame=&MeetingID=1553&MediaPosition=&ID=2056&CssClass=)). The memo points that Part A is illegal in Massachusetts and alleged that this is reverse spot zoning. This petition singles out one or more parcels and is more restrictive than other lots in the same area. He noted that the memo from Mr. McHale points out that it is unclear why the proposed requirements will only apply to such non-conforming lots and not to other lots in the same district. He stated that the quantity and characteristics of the parcels that will be affected by the Cohen petition must be known and that the petitioner did not do this research. He stated that he has had previous petitions that have been enacted by the City Council. He spoke of a previous petition submitted that failed to pass that contained language that a special permit may normally be granted to be in compliance with state law that a special permit may be granted. The public was questioning why special permits were always approved. He noted that it was disappointing that the City Council did not seek a legal opinion on this that was offered by the City Solicitor. He announced that the approval process is set by state case law. He noted that Part B of the petition tries to change the approval process and override state law. He concluded that this petition is a waste of time because it is illegal.\n\nJohn Tittmann, 29 Kelley Street, spoke about the livability of the streets in Cambridge. This petition addresses an important issues. Street need to be built and a zoning process created that insures that streets are for people to walk on; not designed to make it more comfortable for cars. Convenient streets created for automobiles make it dangerous for walking. He stated that putting garage doors against street sidewalks is not good for urbanism. \n\nBill Wendel, 97A Garden Street, stated that garages will fade in importance in our lifetime. He stated that the question needs to be asked is what the future of garages is. Garages are being turned into livable space.\n\nOn a motion of Councillor Devereux public comment closed at 6:10 PM on a voice vote of six members.\n\nCity Council Discussion\n\nCouncillor Mazen agreed with the petitioners that cars are a dying breed and garages need to comport with certain ascetic qualities. He expressed his frustration with the neighbor/developer conflicts and that there is immense room for a win-win situation in this matter and that filing a zoning petition is a last resort. There is little attempt to make the developer happy because in this case the developer is someone in the neighborhood who owns property and wants to make money from the property. He stated properties should not be allowed to make money; it should be used for housing. In this situation the designs are not unseemly; the neighborhood could have helped with the designs. He noted that the antagonism is such that it would be difficult to arrive at a win-win situation. He felt that the reverse spot zoning character of this petition is illegal. He wants to say yes and this petition is not working in this vein. He expressed his frustration with this situation and wished neighborhoods could solve these problems substantively. \n\nCouncillor Devereux questioned Mr. Roberts if there is problem with garages in Res. B would CDD have been thinking about this otherwise. Mr. Roberts responded that this is not an issue that has been brought to his intention. He stated that he was not aware of garages being put into the front of small residential lots. The project cited by the petitioner is a case before the Planning Board and the deals with two separate structures on a lot. He stated that the provision of the zoning causes the developers to put forth a single structure design that is deliberately unattractive because the provisions of the zoning stated that the Planning Board has to make a determination that the development of two structures is superior to a single structure. Councillor Devereux noted that as long as this petition is active the developer is blocked from doing anything. She questioned if the special permit is granted does this petition stop the demolition and the development is less economically viable the longer there is delay. Mr. Roberts responded that the special permit was decided but the decision has not filed. He further stated that because the decision was not filed before the petition was advertised and if the zoning were adopted it would be effective retroactively to the date when it was first advertised. If the City Council choses to adopt the petition the Donnell Street project would be subject to petition because the special permit has not been filed before the first advertisement date. The current status of the Special Permit depends on what the City Council decides to do. The Inspectional Services Department will not issue a building permit if the project is in this uncertain stage of not knowing if the project conforms to the zoning. Before a building permit is issued this petition must be resolved.\n\nCouncillor Maher added that the work done would be done at jeopardy due to the petition. Mr. Roberts agreed that if a building permit were issued the developer would be building at risk and if the City Council adopted the petition the developer would have to alter the project or seek additional relief. Councillor Maher commented that there is more going on than what is happening at Donnell Street. This is an extremely tight street and neighborhood and people are frustrated. He understands the frustration when people want to change the neighborhood. He is eager to hear what the Planning Board will say about this petition and how many properties this does effects. He added that this neighborhood has been underseiged and the City Council has a responsibility to act on the changes to this neighborhood. He stated that changes will be coming to Concord Avenue.\n\nVice Mayor McGovern stated that he hoped that issues are resolved in a collaborative way. He stated that there is an issue on Kinnaird Street where a second dwelling was built with a garage in front that has caused concern for the neighbors. He wanted a legal opinion and what the PB has to say. He wanted to hear the risk that the City is taking on this matter. He stated that there is creditability on this. He wanted a legal opinion. \n\nMayor Simmons stated that this petition could be referred to the Ordinance Committee. \n\nCouncillor Toomey moved to keep the matter in committee. The motion carried on a voice vote of 6 members.\n\nThe following e-mails were received and made part of the report.\n\nI.  Communications\n\n1.

The neighbors were told by the property owners that there is an alternative and they can build by right one long structure with a garage structure in front, view I is what the structure would look like from the street. It is his understanding that this is what the developer wants to build on the site with Planning Board approval. During the Planning Board hearing the Planning Board members questioned whether the development was economically viable. He stated that the zoning could be amended to prohibit this or the Planning Board could grant a special permit. He wanted to get ahead of this situation before the structure is built. He depicted a reasonable development that has a garage. He spoke about the technical and spiritual aspects of this proposal. He stated that 101 Orchard Street depicts frontage of a house and a garage. This amendment would only effect a narrow group of properties that are dimensional non-conforming lots where there is a garage. He spoke of the law of unintended consequences. He commented that developers are looking at lots as an economic proposition. He wanted development done in a tasteful way that does not upset neighborhood values. He stated that within the first 50 feet of land a garage should not be built, but could apply to the Planning Board for a special permit. He explained the structure of his petition. He stated that Section B (2) of his petition deals with demolition during the pendency period of the special permit application and covers historical signification properties that are being torn down. This will codify the current practice. Mr. Cohen stated that Section C deals with if the petition is challenged by developers and struck down this would just prohibit garages in the front 50 feet. He spoke about the memo written by Community Development start. He stated that language in his petition needs to be clarified. It is not the intention to prohibit parking rather where parking is put. He wanted to find a balance for the neighborhood and developer with neighborhood values being primary. He noted that the language in his petition needs refinement.\n\nPeter L.

He stated that the Planning Board will hear the petition on March 8. The memo contains an overview of the petition. The full impact of the petition have not been fully studied and Residence B is a common zoning district which contains about 4,000 lots and have not studied how many of these lots are non-conforming. It is not typical for lots to be narrower than the 50 foot lot width. In the current zoning ordinance between Articles Five and Six there are a set of different requirements pertaining to parking facilities, both in structured parking facilities such as garages as well as surface parking. There are restrictions currently in place for smaller lots and there is more flexibility. The issue raised with this proposal is the balance between the requirement that housing when created has to provide parking at one space per unit and must meet the dimensional requirement in the zoning verses having additional restrictions that would limit where the parking is allowed to go and be designed on the lot. Relief is sought by a special permit from the Planning Board or variance from the Board of Zoning Appeal. Mr. Roberts added that the petitioner did not some of the technical points made. One is that the proposed provision is cited in Article Ten, the procedures section, of the zoning. What is being proposed is more of a development control and belongs in Article 5 of the zoning. He commented on the terminology of multi-family which is standard term in zoning and building codes that refers to three units or more. Sections B and C in the petition that discusses procedures for special permit relief provisions are unusual compared to the way that special permits are typically provided for in the zoning. When there is a special permit provision there is criteria cited and if the Planning Board or BZA finds that the project meets the zoning requirements and the criteria outlined in the zoning then the special permit will be granted; variances require proving hardship to have the zoning requirement relieved. These provisions if passed needs to be reviewed to determine the legal appropriateness of the language.\n\nPeter L. Cohen, et al., Zoning Petition - Community Development Memo.\n\nPublic Comment\n\nAt this time Mayor Simmons opened the hearing to public comment.\n\nCharles Teague, 23 Edmonds Street, stated that he is the project manager for the lot that is the target of this petition. He noted that this project is targeted because it is next door to Attorney Cohen. He stated that this petition is illegal. He noted that for Part A there is a letter from the trustee of 9 Donnell Street, Mr. Robert McHale has been sent to the City Council and is written protest to the petition ([COMMUNICATION #3](http://cambridgema.iqm2.com/Citizens/Detail_LegiFile.aspx?Frame=&MeetingID=1553&MediaPosition=&ID=2056&CssClass=)). The memo points that Part A is illegal in Massachusetts and alleged that this is reverse spot zoning. This petition singles out one or more parcels and is more restrictive than other lots in the same area. He noted that the memo from Mr. McHale points out that it is unclear why the proposed requirements will only apply to such non-conforming lots and not to other lots in the same district. He stated that the quantity and characteristics of the parcels that will be affected by the Cohen petition must be known and that the petitioner did not do this research. He stated that he has had previous petitions that have been enacted by the City Council. He spoke of a previous petition submitted that failed to pass that contained language that a special permit may normally be granted to be in compliance with state law that a special permit may be granted. The public was questioning why special permits were always approved. He noted that it was disappointing that the City Council did not seek a legal opinion on this that was offered by the City Solicitor. He announced that the approval process is set by state case law. He noted that Part B of the petition tries to change the approval process and override state law. He concluded that this petition is a waste of time because it is illegal.\n\nJohn Tittmann, 29 Kelley Street, spoke about the livability of the streets in Cambridge. This petition addresses an important issues. Street need to be built and a zoning process created that insures that streets are for people to walk on; not designed to make it more comfortable for cars. Convenient streets created for automobiles make it dangerous for walking. He stated that putting garage doors against street sidewalks is not good for urbanism. \n\nBill Wendel, 97A Garden Street, stated that garages will fade in importance in our lifetime. He stated that the question needs to be asked is what the future of garages is. Garages are being turned into livable space.\n\nOn a motion of Councillor Devereux public comment closed at 6:10 PM on a voice vote of six members.\n\nCity Council Discussion\n\nCouncillor Mazen agreed with the petitioners that cars are a dying breed and garages need to comport with certain ascetic qualities. He expressed his frustration with the neighbor/developer conflicts and that there is immense room for a win-win situation in this matter and that filing a zoning petition is a last resort. There is little attempt to make the developer happy because in this case the developer is someone in the neighborhood who owns property and wants to make money from the property. He stated properties should not be allowed to make money; it should be used for housing. In this situation the designs are not unseemly; the neighborhood could have helped with the designs. He noted that the antagonism is such that it would be difficult to arrive at a win-win situation. He felt that the reverse spot zoning character of this petition is illegal. He wants to say yes and this petition is not working in this vein. He expressed his frustration with this situation and wished neighborhoods could solve these problems substantively. \n\nCouncillor Devereux questioned Mr. Roberts if there is problem with garages in Res. B would CDD have been thinking about this otherwise. Mr. Roberts responded that this is not an issue that has been brought to his intention. He stated that he was not aware of garages being put into the front of small residential lots. The project cited by the petitioner is a case before the Planning Board and the deals with two separate structures on a lot. He stated that the provision of the zoning causes the developers to put forth a single structure design that is deliberately unattractive because the provisions of the zoning stated that the Planning Board has to make a determination that the development of two structures is superior to a single structure. Councillor Devereux noted that as long as this petition is active the developer is blocked from doing anything. She questioned if the special permit is granted does this petition stop the demolition and the development is less economically viable the longer there is delay. Mr. Roberts responded that the special permit was decided but the decision has not filed. He further stated that because the decision was not filed before the petition was advertised and if the zoning were adopted it would be effective retroactively to the date when it was first advertised. If the City Council choses to adopt the petition the Donnell Street project would be subject to petition because the special permit has not been filed before the first advertisement date. The current status of the Special Permit depends on what the City Council decides to do. The Inspectional Services Department will not issue a building permit if the project is in this uncertain stage of not knowing if the project conforms to the zoning. Before a building permit is issued this petition must be resolved.\n\nCouncillor Maher added that the work done would be done at jeopardy due to the petition. Mr. Roberts agreed that if a building permit were issued the developer would be building at risk and if the City Council adopted the petition the developer would have to alter the project or seek additional relief. Councillor Maher commented that there is more going on than what is happening at Donnell Street. This is an extremely tight street and neighborhood and people are frustrated. He understands the frustration when people want to change the neighborhood. He is eager to hear what the Planning Board will say about this petition and how many properties this does effects. He added that this neighborhood has been underseiged and the City Council has a responsibility to act on the changes to this neighborhood. He stated that changes will be coming to Concord Avenue.\n\nVice Mayor McGovern stated that he hoped that issues are resolved in a collaborative way. He stated that there is an issue on Kinnaird Street where a second dwelling was built with a garage in front that has caused concern for the neighbors. He wanted a legal opinion and what the PB has to say. He wanted to hear the risk that the City is taking on this matter. He stated that there is creditability on this. He wanted a legal opinion. \n\nMayor Simmons stated that this petition could be referred to the Ordinance Committee. \n\nCouncillor Toomey moved to keep the matter in committee. The motion carried on a voice vote of 6 members.\n\nThe following e-mails were received and made part of the report.\n\nI.  Communications\n\n1.

Denise SimmonsCouncillor Timothy Toomey|   \n---|---  \n  \nThe Public Safety Committee held a public hearing on December 14, 2015 beginning at 3:02 P.M. in the Sullivan Chamber.\n\nThe purpose of the hearing was to discuss the climate change vulnerability assessment.\n\nPresent at the hearing were Councillor Craig Kelley, Chair of the Committee, Councillor Dennis J. Carlone, Councillor E. Denise Simmons, Councillor Marc McGovern, Councillor Nadeem Mazen, Susanne Rasmussen, Director, Environmental and Transportation Planning Division of Community Development Department, Owen O\u2019Riordan, Public Works Commissioner, Kathy Watkins, City Engineer, Sam Lipson, Director, Environmental Health, Public Health Department and City Clerk   \nDonna P. Lopez. \n\nAlso present were Jan Devereux, 255 Lakeview Avenue, Megan Brooks, 103 Inman Street, Ann F. Durbin, 78 Pearson Avenue, Somerville, Andrea Wilder, 12 Arlington Street and Robert Winters, 366 Broadway.\n\nCouncillor Kelley convened the hearing and explained the purpose. He submitted an agenda for the hearing (ATTACHMENT A). He explained the format. He would give his overview, then City staff and general discussion. The Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment Report (CCVA) is focused on sea level rise and storm water surge, precipitation and temperature with three planning horizons. Experts talk about things using terms that regular people do not understand. He stated that if the City wants the CCVA report taken seriously it needs to be understandable from the public perspective. He spoke about the need for graphics rather than text. He stated that this needs to be sold similar to an insurance project. He asked city staff to explain the CCVA process. \n\nSusanne Rasmussen, CDD, stated that the themes were selected from conversations with climate change experts and scientist. Heat, sea level rise and storm surge were identified as threats. The findings from the climate change study will be published in February. The scope of the plan is being finalized. The biggest challenge is to integrate this with the city-wide plan which will cover the preparedness plan. She stated that on December 3rd the City held a public meeting to discuss climate change issues and how to address the threats. She stated that there is a regional collaboration about climate change preparedness.\n\nCommissioner O'Riordan stated that smaller groups in the community will meet to have conversations about climate change, to see the impacts and to understand the concerns of various communities about climate change. He stated that the City takes climate change impacts seriously over the short and long term. There needs to be consensus for change.\n\nSam Lipson spoke about the health aspects in the assessment. This is meant to create a realistic view. The direct relationship increase in heat and mortality is impressive. What is the additional stress to a population? There was a challenge in the assessment to talk about the health effect appropriately and there is not a lot of consensus on what is going to happen with temperature increases. He stated that in the City\u2019s technical report you will see more talk about disease vectors like mosquito borne illnesses, etc. identified as issues to be concerned about as they relate to climate change. This is meant to be look at a system risk perspective and includes the keeping of food, food safety and distribution problems. Systemic risks such as power outages will be considered. This type of information is not in the report that has been released but will be in a future white paper that talks about what happens under various likely scenarios.\n\nCouncillor Kelley asked how we manage the information, knowledge and events such as the public meetings to be held. How is the public informed of the meetings? How do we get a representative public involved? Ms. Rasmussen noted that all the public meetings are advertised and the web site will reflect all activities. The smaller meetings will be arranged from direct outreach. Mr. O'Riordan stated that neighborhood groups, pastors, business organization will be utilized with the hope that this information be transferred to other interested persons. Extreme heat and flooding are primary means that climate change will affect us with secondary issues such as power outages, food security and then illnesses. The initial thoughts are for City staff to go to organizations in the community and ask people who are interested in this to participate with the City in this matter. It is a new area for City staff and they want to be flexible in their approach. The CCVA is a stress test and as we move to the preparedness plan additional stresses will be studied and put into the public domain. The assessment took three years and the planning is probably going to take two. The best science and engineering was used for the assessment and the complex modeling required special computing access which led to delays. He stated that meetings have been scheduled for Harvard Square and Mid-Cambridge neighborhood association. Ms. Rasmussen stated that all activities will be posted when they are finalized. The two meetings are not posted now. Councillor Kelley wanted to go to the web site and map out the City meetings scheduled. Commissioner O'Riordan stated that staff is being asked to attend association meetings and are on their agenda for 5-10 minutes. He stated that Councillor Kelley's wishes will be respected to post the meetings.\n\nCouncillor McGovern stated that neighborhood organizations are good places to go. He stated that only the most robust neighborhood organizations represent a true segment of the neighbors. He suggested working with the school department, perhaps through their curriculum, and to have larger meetings with the community. He stated that outreach at the neighborhood organizations are only a piece of the notification process. He suggested using the City Council to promote these meetings as well. Ms. Rasmussen stated that the City-wide Master Plan outreach will be a significant way to talk to people. This will start in the Alewife area. The CCVA is such a critical part of forward planning.\n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that there are critical zones that will be impacted. He suggested having meetings in these areas. He suggested using television and cable. He spoke of the impact of state bridges and roads blocking effective drainage and making flooding worse. How has the state been involved? Commissioner O'Riordan it was through DOT\u2019s Central Artery study that the City obtained its modeling. He also stated that Department of Conservation & Resources (DCR) has looked at their bridges and dams (Craddick Dam on Mystic River and the Charles River Dam). He spoke about the importance of having these systems operate correctly even for less significant storm events and the critical importance of having the pumps working for major events. The City is looking at regional flood prevention efforts, especially for big events, and Mass DOT must be involved.\n\nCouncillor Carlone spoke about Route 2 development, the fact that Route 2 acts as a type of dam, and the option of expanding wetlands and greenspace and looking at water retention. Commissioner O'Riordan stated that maps produced are results of rare events projected for 2070. But smaller events, 5-10 years, need to be understood as well as even with non-major events, flooding can overwhelm the bridges and drainage systems and once on the site, water cannot easily be removed. He stated that the smaller events can benefit from storm water management planning but that, realistically, there is not much that can be done for major storm water events like a 100 year storm. In that case, our efforts are simply going to be inconsequential. \n\nCouncillor Simmons spoke about the importance of outreach to the community and its two part nature - normal, customary people and the harder to reach people. She suggested looking at the neighborhood and proposing to reach 10% of the neighborhood and break it down to ethnicity. She wanted to see this data broken down. She wanted a quantifiable way of reaching the community. She stated that how the outreach is done must be very creative to figure out how specific populations find this issue relevant. We are being creative to reach out to these communities she suggested using the Church service as a method of notification, to include going to services, offering meals and so forth.\n\nSam Lipson stated that the conversation is just beginning about outreach now that the CCVA is done, especially how to reach people who are not usually reached. He stated that the Public Health Department had to get creative with the types of questions asked and used focus groups to formulate the questions as was done with the Community Health Assessment. There are existing groups, such as Baby U, that can also add communications value. He spoke about the number of people who responded to the survey on line. Climate change vulnerability reflects are old concerns, not new ones. Being prepared is not new. He stated that vulnerability, and preparedness, is a household by household issue as each household has a different set of concerns. It\u2019s about getting ready for a snowstorm and more. Councillor Simmons spoke about people participating to keep themselves safe. She stated that this needs to be multi-lingual and constant, maybe use \u201cClimate Ambassadors\u201d to provide a level of authenticity. She stated that the City Council may be able to engage more people to attend these meeting. She spoke about poverty and access to good food. She asked if there is a correlation that poorer areas are more vulnerable. Mr. Lipson stated that they are starting to identify resources communities rely on for flooding and, sometimes, heat risks. Councillor Simmons asked if asthma was correlated to poverty. Commissioner O'Riordan responded in the affirmative. Councillor Simmons noted that the City Council can help provide resources in these key communities. If the eastern part of the City is more vulnerability, then the community benefit mitigation funds could be used in those neighborhoods. She also noted that it will be necessary to make repeat visits to various places at different times.\n\nCouncillor Kelley opened the hearing to public comment.\n\nMegan Brooks, 103 Inman Street, stated that she has not read any of the reports. The general planning should be connected to the City. She stated that preparing and protecting the environment is bigger than any other issue of the City. She wanted preparedness put above any other thing in the City. If the land is overdeveloped it will be harder to prepare for these problems.\n\nAndrea Wilder, 12 Arlington Street, became aware of this 5-6 years ago when she learned from the Boston Harbor Association that the height of the water from Boston Harbor would affect the Moakley Steps. She stated that Cambridge does not know what Boston will be doing. She stated that her concern is the transportation for the Redline to stay dry and preventing this subway from becoming a river. She stated that open spaces act like sponges by planting trees. She would like green space increased with trees that provide shade. She spoke about building material and shingles used. She stated that CDD and special permits requirements need to be reviewed and changed to reflect the reality of climate change to use non-heat sink building materials and so forth. She spoke about changes in insurance policies that will affect homes and building and how buildings will have to, like the Spaulding building in Charlestown, compensate for climate change. She stated that making building flood proofing should be part of the regulations. She spoke about reviewing requirements for new buildings and retrofitting old buildings. She suggested that when distributing information to groups, maps would be a good tool. Ms. Rasmussen stated that this is what the preparedness plan will consist of. The CCVA will focus the City to look at the tree canopy and what are the strategies needed for a new buildings and providing flood proofing.\n\nJan Devereux, 255 Lakeview Avenue, noted her communications background and asked what the message is. The PowerPoint is too overwhelming to take to churches and organizations, it is important not to be too alarmist. She suggested speaking about events in people's life time and she stated that she may not be around in 2070. She suggested using 2050. She noted that specifying risk to specific populations, for example garden apartment dwellers, garbage collectors, would be useful. She stated that what can be done to lessen this from happening would be more effective.\n\nAnn Durbin stated that she read the technical part of the report. It is important that the City address the health issues for infectious disease. She further stated that outreach should include talking to health practitioners. She stated that workers who work outside are more vulnerable and that this should be addressed. \n\nRobert Winters, 366 Broadway, stated that, basically, Alewife is a teacup. He spoke about the railroad and the inadequate culverts to convey water across. He spoke about storm drains in the Port and Mid-Cambridge areas. He asked what absolutely needs to be done. He spoke about the method that was used in Lowell. He noted that the MBTA\u2019s flood protection plan may have worked had people understood what they needed to do, but the flashboards were not used and Kenmore Square flooded. When the report was presented there was a focus on the loss of power generation. There is a problem in Cambridge with the aging electrical infrastructure, a \u201cwires in dirt\u2019 power distribution system. It fails during the highest load. He stated that he did not see this addressed in the CCVA. Commissioner O'Riordan stated that as we move throughout the plan the secondary issues such as communications will be addressed but they were not part of the CCVA. He stated that he agreed with the statement about the electrical infrastructure. The primary effort is new development and new projects not upgrading older systems but perhaps the CCVA will help create leverage to improve more vulnerable existing systems. The Alewife sub-station is an issue and an RFP has been put out by Eversource. He spoke about buildings where people can go when there is an emergency. More people are looking at \u201cislanding.\u201d Ms. Rasmussen stated that low carbon energy study RFP will be put out next year which may help islanding. \n\nCouncillor Kelley commented that this conversation is daunting. How can this be manageable? This was flooding and heating. What happens when people cannot go into their building when it is too hot? Low carbon energy RFP is tied to resiliency. He wanted to know that the 1500 City employees can communicate about these issues. The schools need to be part of our resiliency disaster planning. Councillor Carlone spoke about communications being out in a flood. We do not want to over emphasize the fear.\n\nMr. Lipson stated that the Public Health Department it is about preparing for bad news. He spoke about FEMA duct tape instructions being silly but widespread. Emphasizing evacuation is not practical; keep the message practical and relevant. This is not new stuff. There are lessons to be learned from incidents that have occurred. He spoke about the problem with delivering medicine by the mail during Hurricane Sandy in Hoboken, NJ. The solution was to have a pharmacist filling prescriptions in City Hall.\n\nCouncillor Kelley stated that he does not think that there are two years to think about instances. Councillor McGovern stated he did not know what an evacuation plan is. Is there a set plan if there is an emergency and how is the community notified. Mr. Lipson stated the Red Cross has approved facilities beforehand in the event of an emergency and that the Fire Department\u2019s Emergency Planning Committee handles this.\n\nMs. Durbin asked if the City has its own radio station. She suggested having a hand cranked radio. Commissioner O'Riordan stated that DPW staff engages with other departments and lays out the plan, much as happens with snow operations. Councillor Simmons suggested looking at previous plans.\n\nMegan Brooks stated that universities have enormous resources. She stated that a crank radio is a good idea. She stated that information should also be in paper form to all residents. \n\nMs. Devereux stated that a communication department figures out what message needs to be sent out and that perhaps less \u201cemergency communications\u201d and more department communications would be a good idea. Ms. Rasmussen stated that where the shelters are located are unknown. Commissioner O'Riordan stated that Lee Gianetti is the Communication Director in the Office of the City Manager and there are two communication specialist in Public Works. Mr. Lipson stated that better communication has occurred. He noted that the City\u2019s use of social media is improving. Commissioner O'Riordan spoke about the snow emergency of last year and the collaboration between Public Works and the City Manager's office.\n\nCouncillor Kelley stated that if this is the challenge of our times better communication needs to be done.\n\nCouncillor Kelley thanked all those present for their attendance. \n\nThe hearing adjourned at 4:34 P.M.\n\nFor the Committee,\n\nCouncillor Craig Kelley, Chair\n\nPublic Safety Committee\n", "full_text": " A communication was received from Donna P.

We do not want to over emphasize the fear.\n\nMr. Lipson stated that the Public Health Department it is about preparing for bad news. He spoke about FEMA duct tape instructions being silly but widespread. Emphasizing evacuation is not practical; keep the message practical and relevant. This is not new stuff. There are lessons to be learned from incidents that have occurred. He spoke about the problem with delivering medicine by the mail during Hurricane Sandy in Hoboken, NJ. The solution was to have a pharmacist filling prescriptions in City Hall.\n\nCouncillor Kelley stated that he does not think that there are two years to think about instances. Councillor McGovern stated he did not know what an evacuation plan is. Is there a set plan if there is an emergency and how is the community notified. Mr. Lipson stated the Red Cross has approved facilities beforehand in the event of an emergency and that the Fire Department\u2019s Emergency Planning Committee handles this.\n\nMs. Durbin asked if the City has its own radio station. She suggested having a hand cranked radio. Commissioner O'Riordan stated that DPW staff engages with other departments and lays out the plan, much as happens with snow operations. Councillor Simmons suggested looking at previous plans.\n\nMegan Brooks stated that universities have enormous resources. She stated that a crank radio is a good idea. She stated that information should also be in paper form to all residents. \n\nMs. Devereux stated that a communication department figures out what message needs to be sent out and that perhaps less \u201cemergency communications\u201d and more department communications would be a good idea. Ms. Rasmussen stated that where the shelters are located are unknown. Commissioner O'Riordan stated that Lee Gianetti is the Communication Director in the Office of the City Manager and there are two communication specialist in Public Works. Mr. Lipson stated that better communication has occurred. He noted that the City\u2019s use of social media is improving. Commissioner O'Riordan spoke about the snow emergency of last year and the collaboration between Public Works and the City Manager's office.\n\nCouncillor Kelley stated that if this is the challenge of our times better communication needs to be done.\n\nCouncillor Kelley thanked all those present for their attendance. \n\nThe hearing adjourned at 4:34 P.M.\n\nFor the Committee,\n\nCouncillor Craig Kelley, Chair\n\nPublic Safety Committee\n Public Safety climate change vulnerability assessment"}, {"meetingdate": "2016-02-01T00:00:00.000", "meetingdescript": "City Council Regular Meeting", "meetingid": "1023", "documenttypename": "Application and Petitions", "resolutionshorttitle": "Blue Hills Bank blade sign", "resolutionid": "1896", "voteresultname": "ORDER ADOPTED", "voteyes": "8", "voteno": "0", "voteabstain": "0", "voteabsent": "1", "votepresent": "0", "dennis_carlone": "Yeas", "jan_devereux": "Yeas", "craig_kelley": "Yeas", "marc_mcgovern": "Yeas", "denise_simmons": "Yeas", "tim_toomey": "Yeas", "aceladescription": "\n\nORDERED:| That, in accordance with the provisions of an ordinance relative to placing and maintaining signs, the Commissioner of Public Works be and hereby is authorized to grant a permit to Blue Hills Bank for a projecting blade sign at the premises numbered 200 Concord Avenue, Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Denise Simmons Councillor Timothy J. Toomey, Jr. |   \n---|---  \n  \nThe Ordinance Committee held a public hearing on November 19, 2015 beginning at \n\n2:16 P.M. in the Sullivan Chamber. \n\nThe purpose of the hearing was to discuss a petition filed by Patrick W. Barrett III, et al. to amend the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance by amending Article 2.000 (\u201cDefinitions\u201d) and Article 4.000, Section 4.22 (\u201cAccessory Apartment\u201d).  (ATTACHMENT <http://www2.cambridgema.gov/cityclerk/AppsPetitionsOrder.cfm?item_id=11436> A).\n\nPresent at the hearing were Vice Mayor Dennis A. Benzan and Councillor Dennis J. Carlone, Co-Chairs of the Committee, Councillor Craig Kelley, Mayor David P. Maher, \n\nCouncillor Marc C. McGovern, Councillor E. Denise Simmons, Councillor Timothy J. Toomey, Jr., Jeff Roberts, Zoning and Land Use Planner, Community Development Department (CDD) and City Clerk Donna P. Lopez.\n\nAlso present were Patrick Barrett, 234 Broadway, Marilee Meyer, 10 Dana Street, Doug Brown, 35 Standish Street, Carol O'Hare, 172 Magazine Street, Dave Lewis, 58 Regent Street, Tony Madan, Pebble Gifford, 15 Hilliard Street, Amy Munsat, 71 Standish Street, Jan Lewis, 58 Regent Street, Jan Devereux, 255 Lakeview Avenue, James Williamson, 1000 Jackson Place, Wayne Bingham, Cedar Street and Stephen Kaiser, 191 Hamilton Street.\n\nVice Mayor Benzan convened the hearing and explained the purpose and stated that the hearing is being audio and visually recorded.\n\nThe petitioner, Patrick Barrett, gave a presentation (ATTACHMENT B). He stated that the public process was limited and this petition came about after discussions with the community and his neighbors. He explained that this petition began two years ago. He stated that basement apartments are low hanging fruit. He stated that families are faced with difficult decisions of being over or under-housed. If the petition is adopted as written, housing units will be created. He stated that the current zoning has accessory housing. He stated that the City is constantly looking to increase housing. This is done by density. He stated that the Harvard Defense Fund submitted a similar petition previously. He stated that there is a significant housing for large houses. Opportunities across the City can be found to create accessory uses. A variance is currently required to do this. He stated that the Master Plan for the City and none of the studies will say less housing is needed. The Master Plan wants to preserve the neighborhoods. He had a list of amendments. He stated that the Planning Board had difficulty distinguishing two family houses to allow this. The two family caveat is eliminated. This may be something for the Master Plan to decide. The proposed changes are outlined in the maps (ATTACHMENT C-1 - C-3); the red are additional units; 1007 additional units will be created without changing the contextual, construction of what is existing. He stated that Part A and Part B effects both sides of the City. This amendment should be used as a tool. He discussed areas that were issues for the Planning Board. He did not want to create an administrative burden and he suggested eliminating the affidavit provision. The last portion refers to Part A. He stated that there is no long term effect on neighborhoods and parking which were concerns for residents and the Planning Board. The map shows where accessory units will be allowed. He eliminated the requirement for parking for accessory units because a special permit is required for parking. This purpose of this petition was to create homes and give flexibility to homeowners. This petition gives something to homeowners. He stated that a suggested amendment is that parking is added and could be eliminated by a special permit. He stated that Part B eliminates GFA space above six feet for a single or two family homes by as of right or special permit. He noted that many basements have illegal uses. He stated that the Building, Sanitary and Municipal Ordinance do not line up. He stated that under the Building Code currently in a single or two family home it allowed finishing off a basement at 6'8\" or greater. Depending on the FAR a variance or special permit may be required. He is suggesting that for single and two family homes it is allowed. He is trying to create parity. He stated that in the Sanitary Code spaces that are 6'11\" or lower are not livable or habitable. The Municipal Ordinance lines up with 6\"11\" GFA. He stated that eliminating height in basement units does not make sense. He stated that there are many units that are unknown by ISD or the Fire Department that are not up to code and are potential hazards. This creates underground units. He asked for allowance for people to use these spaces and bring them up to code. He stated that the biggest issue is flooding and there are areas in the City where this cannot be done, but this will still be an issue for a 6'11\" basement. He included that this should be allowed in large commercial spaces. He stated that he owns the property where Toscanni's is located and has used basement space for 30 years and now it is a kitchen. He noted that basement spaces are being used. He stated that if the City is looking to find creative ways to use space to rezone a large are to allow additional structure there is already existing basement space that can be used. He suggested in his amendment that the special permit provision be eliminated. He stated that there are open space, set back and height requirements that prevent building throughout the City. These will still control what is able to be used and Article 8 would still apply. This is a way to create parity for a proposal that has not received support over the years. He explained part B. He stated let us use this space, know where these spaces are, what they are being used for and tax the property. We are taking existing space and use it more effectively, preserve the neighborhood, and help families.\n\nJeff Roberts noted that the Planning Board heard this petition on October 27, 2015 and recommended that the petition needed further study. An advance copy of the Planning Board recommendation which will be on the agenda for the November 23rd City Council was distributed (ATTACHMENT D). Mr. Roberts stated that the Planning Board felt that there were some good points to the petition such as using the existing housing stock with more flexibility, but felt that there were aspect of the proposal that needed further study. Accessory units operate in a full set of zoning requirements and development controls and that the challenge be looked at in a comprehensive way and be considered in the city-wide process and establish goals and objectives. \n\nCouncillor McGovern asked if the amendments submitted last night to the City Council address the Planning Board concerns. Mr. Roberts stated that this is the first time he has seen proposed changes and cannot comment.\n\nVice Mayor Benzan opened public comment at 2:46 PM.\n\nMarilee Meyer, 10 Dana Street stated that she was lost in the details. Her impression is that the petition is a city-wide up zoning for properties that may or may not be appropriate. The Planning Board stated that this is not ready for prime time and is not directed at affordable housing. Mid-Cambridge is the most dense neighborhood but Mr. Barrett is talking about West Cambridge. This is encouraging infill with some of these properties. She stated that parking, entries to the unit, windows and window wells, density, noise and regulations and utilities are concerns. She spoke about the requirement of the Historical Commission regarding foundations. She did not want the historical character of the neighborhood lost. This petition benefits the petitioner. \n\nDoug Brown, 35 Standish Street, signed the petition and it is a valid way to get more housing. He agreed with the amendments proposed and limits unintended consequences. He stated people live in sub-standard spaces, have to follow the expensive variances or do the changes illegally. He stated that not every accessory unit will benefit or vice versa some additional living space may be sought and may be in a basement or attic. Regarding the historical significance these requirements and rules still apply; approval from Historical Commission is still required. He stated most houses are already over on the FAR and when all the requirements are added in not much is left. He supports this proposal and urged the City Council to pass it.\n\nCarol O'Hare, 172 Magazine Street, stated that a major amendment has been proposed and reached the City Council last night and did not get circulated ahead of time. She stated that owner occupied amendment was amended from the original petition would be dropped. She objected to the initial owner occupied accessory apartment because there was no mechanism to ensure owner occupancy would continue if the house was sold. This should continue longer than the original owner occupancy provision. This amendment was not filed and due to this amendment being major this process needs to start over again. She submitted her comments (ATTACHMENT E). She spoke of the exclusion of the living space from the FAR for residential units that are not accessory units would apply to new and existing construction. The special permit process is not the place to rezone basement space throughout the city. There should be a uniform way to decide this in zoning. This amendment is right for the Master Planning process or the amendment should begin the process again.\n\nPebble Gifford 15 Hilliard Street, stated that she has an accessory apartment that was grandfathered. She stated that there are problems with this petition. She suggested that each zoning district should be reviewed as to how this would work. She stated that it is ill advised to rezone the entire City with a broad brush as this proposal does. She was involved in drafting the original accessory apartment ordinance in 1970. No changes could be made to the envelope of the building. Parking was a requirement and had to be owner occupied house and provide some income to fix the house. This has worked in a limited way. She stated that you need a separate means of egress which is expensive. She suggested looking at this in a district by district way and not city-wide. Low income housing should be addressed in the Master Plan. She stated that groups cannot be discriminated against such as a group of students living in these units. \n\nAmy Munsat, 71 Standish Street, stated that she is an architectural designer. She stated that for over 25 years she has seen situations where people are struggling to stay in their homes. There is an existing housing stock and this is a way to allow flexibility to redesign their spaces that fits them at where they are in their lives. This addresses numerous issues including aging in place, addresses sustainability and livable space and adds income to families. She stated that so many people could take advantage of this.\n\nJan Devereux, 255 Lakeview Avenue, signed the petition last summer and agreed with the flexibility intent to owners to the existing housing stock. She stated that some of the amendments are acceptable. She stated that the additional 623 units is a limited impact because of the burden to create the separate egress and having the capital to do this. Only half of this number may actually benefit which is a small number of units. She added that the current accessory housing ordinance does not require that it be owner occupied.\n\nJames Williamson 1000 Jackson Place, spoke about flooding which is a significant issue. He suggested taking a look at where flooding would be a problem. Height may be an issue, unit size, livability and minimum square footage. He likes the theory of low and moderate income people being able to do something to remain in their homes. Protecting the affordability of the units is a conundrum. Neighborhood density and parking are issues. He stated that there are complexities with this. He agreed with the Planning Board on this.\n\nAt this time Councillor Carlone assumed the chair.\n\nStephen Kaiser, 191 Hamilton, a homeowner of a three decker since 1972. The discussion is for one or two family houses. He stated that if he paints his house he can have low rents. His primary concerns are flooding and basements. He stated that no study has been done by the proponent about the flood levels and storms. He agreed with the Planning Board recommendation. He stated that in July 2010 there was 4 inches of rain in 70 minutes. As a result the Public Works building and the Somerville Fire station were flooded. This is a practical concern and it is not addressed in the petition. He is more in opposition. He spoke about destabilization of neighborhoods. If this were passed it would result in high cost renovations and it would lead to high rents and Cambridge cannot lose low and moderate income housing. He stated that the proposal needs further study. He urged the City Council not to pass the proposal. He submitted his comments (ATTACHMENT F).\n\nWayne Bingham, Cedar Street, stated that there is construction on each side of his house and the children are being woken up at 7 AM. He asked why there must be development taking place on every square inch of land in Cambridge. He asked is the City pro-developer or pro-neighborhood. He stated that the neighborhoods are gone.\n\nTony Madan stated that this is a way to get affordable housing. He spoke about the rents charged for a basement apartment compared to a sunny upper floor apartment. This will be an incentive for landlords being property up to code.\n\nPublic comment closed at 3:27 PM on motion of Councillor Carlone.\n\nVice Mayor Benzan assumed the Chair and asked the pleasure of the City Council.\n\nCouncillor McGovern spoke about historical concerns and flooding issues will there be a process to approve what gets built. Mr. Barrett stated that this is to align the Building, Sanitary and Municipal Codes. All approvals will be needed in order to build. He stated single and two family houses can be renovated at 6'11\" without a special permit. He stated that you want ISD inspectors to look at these units. He stated that some properties are not allowed to do this. He stated that basements could be renovated but not be accessory space. Councillor McGovern stated that height and density are issues. This is a way to create affordable units and a way to let family members, seniors and students stay in their homes. People who want to live close to their work want to live in the City. He wanted assurance that these units would be low income units. Mr. Barrett states that there is no owner occupied required in the accessory apartment. He stated that if you want to create accessory units for low income residents you can, but it is not his intention. He wants to create flexibility and more housing for everyone, not just affordable housing. \n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that the thrust of proposal makes sense. He suggested above garages as added living space. Scandinavian countries build in the attic and add elevators especially for the elderly. He stated that this would make sense in some instances and not in others. He spoke about using a French drain for moisture in basements. He stated that renovations needed could be expensive and this is where the rents may be effected. The premise makes sense. The Planning Board recommendation that this be part of the Master Plan makes sense and getting it right makes sense.\n\nMayor Maher stated the petition shows the creativity for housing and access to housing. He stated that basement overlay district was done last term along Mass. Avenue from the Cambridge Common to Porter Square. We are seeing what can be done in these apartments. Mr. Roberts outlined the projects that are ongoing. Mayor Maher stated that there is a provision about the flood zone that the Public Works Commissioner has to sign off if the units are in a flood zone. This has merit and he is grateful that this was brought forward. There is an opportunity to continue to look at this and have adapted the recommendation. Mr. Barrett stated that PART A and B are different. The accessory apartment part could be brought into the Master Plan process but the Part B does not need study by the Master Plan. He is talking about freedom and flexibility to use space in a safe, legal way. \n\nVice Mayor Benzan commended Mr. Barrett. How do we prevent a sell-off of single and two family homes? Mr. Barrett stated that the inclusion of two family structures complicates this proposal and he included two family units to create units. Mr. Barrett stated that in his original proposal he included ownership affidavit. The current ordinance does not require any chain of ownership. \n\nCouncillor Toomey moved that the matter be referred to the full City Council without recommendation. The motion carried on a voice vote of five members.\n\nThe following e-mail was received and made part of the report:\n\nCommunication from Carole Perrault stated that the petition is not ready for prime time and its impact on historical and architectural character of neighborhoods needs to be thoroughly understood (ATTACHMENT G).\n\nVice Mayor Benzan thanked all those present for their attendance.\n\nThe hearing adjourned at 3:52 PM.\n\nFor the Committee,\n\n__________________________________\n\nCouncillor Dennis J.

He supports this proposal and urged the City Council to pass it.\n\nCarol O'Hare, 172 Magazine Street, stated that a major amendment has been proposed and reached the City Council last night and did not get circulated ahead of time. She stated that owner occupied amendment was amended from the original petition would be dropped. She objected to the initial owner occupied accessory apartment because there was no mechanism to ensure owner occupancy would continue if the house was sold. This should continue longer than the original owner occupancy provision. This amendment was not filed and due to this amendment being major this process needs to start over again. She submitted her comments (ATTACHMENT E). She spoke of the exclusion of the living space from the FAR for residential units that are not accessory units would apply to new and existing construction. The special permit process is not the place to rezone basement space throughout the city. There should be a uniform way to decide this in zoning. This amendment is right for the Master Planning process or the amendment should begin the process again.\n\nPebble Gifford 15 Hilliard Street, stated that she has an accessory apartment that was grandfathered. She stated that there are problems with this petition. She suggested that each zoning district should be reviewed as to how this would work. She stated that it is ill advised to rezone the entire City with a broad brush as this proposal does. She was involved in drafting the original accessory apartment ordinance in 1970. No changes could be made to the envelope of the building. Parking was a requirement and had to be owner occupied house and provide some income to fix the house. This has worked in a limited way. She stated that you need a separate means of egress which is expensive. She suggested looking at this in a district by district way and not city-wide. Low income housing should be addressed in the Master Plan. She stated that groups cannot be discriminated against such as a group of students living in these units. \n\nAmy Munsat, 71 Standish Street, stated that she is an architectural designer. She stated that for over 25 years she has seen situations where people are struggling to stay in their homes. There is an existing housing stock and this is a way to allow flexibility to redesign their spaces that fits them at where they are in their lives. This addresses numerous issues including aging in place, addresses sustainability and livable space and adds income to families. She stated that so many people could take advantage of this.\n\nJan Devereux, 255 Lakeview Avenue, signed the petition last summer and agreed with the flexibility intent to owners to the existing housing stock. She stated that some of the amendments are acceptable. She stated that the additional 623 units is a limited impact because of the burden to create the separate egress and having the capital to do this. Only half of this number may actually benefit which is a small number of units. She added that the current accessory housing ordinance does not require that it be owner occupied.\n\nJames Williamson 1000 Jackson Place, spoke about flooding which is a significant issue. He suggested taking a look at where flooding would be a problem. Height may be an issue, unit size, livability and minimum square footage. He likes the theory of low and moderate income people being able to do something to remain in their homes. Protecting the affordability of the units is a conundrum. Neighborhood density and parking are issues. He stated that there are complexities with this. He agreed with the Planning Board on this.\n\nAt this time Councillor Carlone assumed the chair.\n\nStephen Kaiser, 191 Hamilton, a homeowner of a three decker since 1972. The discussion is for one or two family houses. He stated that if he paints his house he can have low rents. His primary concerns are flooding and basements. He stated that no study has been done by the proponent about the flood levels and storms. He agreed with the Planning Board recommendation. He stated that in July 2010 there was 4 inches of rain in 70 minutes. As a result the Public Works building and the Somerville Fire station were flooded. This is a practical concern and it is not addressed in the petition. He is more in opposition. He spoke about destabilization of neighborhoods. If this were passed it would result in high cost renovations and it would lead to high rents and Cambridge cannot lose low and moderate income housing. He stated that the proposal needs further study. He urged the City Council not to pass the proposal. He submitted his comments (ATTACHMENT F).\n\nWayne Bingham, Cedar Street, stated that there is construction on each side of his house and the children are being woken up at 7 AM. He asked why there must be development taking place on every square inch of land in Cambridge. He asked is the City pro-developer or pro-neighborhood. He stated that the neighborhoods are gone.\n\nTony Madan stated that this is a way to get affordable housing. He spoke about the rents charged for a basement apartment compared to a sunny upper floor apartment. This will be an incentive for landlords being property up to code.\n\nPublic comment closed at 3:27 PM on motion of Councillor Carlone.\n\nVice Mayor Benzan assumed the Chair and asked the pleasure of the City Council.\n\nCouncillor McGovern spoke about historical concerns and flooding issues will there be a process to approve what gets built. Mr. Barrett stated that this is to align the Building, Sanitary and Municipal Codes. All approvals will be needed in order to build. He stated single and two family houses can be renovated at 6'11\" without a special permit. He stated that you want ISD inspectors to look at these units. He stated that some properties are not allowed to do this. He stated that basements could be renovated but not be accessory space. Councillor McGovern stated that height and density are issues. This is a way to create affordable units and a way to let family members, seniors and students stay in their homes. People who want to live close to their work want to live in the City. He wanted assurance that these units would be low income units. Mr. Barrett states that there is no owner occupied required in the accessory apartment. He stated that if you want to create accessory units for low income residents you can, but it is not his intention. He wants to create flexibility and more housing for everyone, not just affordable housing. \n\nCouncillor Carlone stated that the thrust of proposal makes sense. He suggested above garages as added living space. Scandinavian countries build in the attic and add elevators especially for the elderly. He stated that this would make sense in some instances and not in others. He spoke about using a French drain for moisture in basements. He stated that renovations needed could be expensive and this is where the rents may be effected. The premise makes sense. The Planning Board recommendation that this be part of the Master Plan makes sense and getting it right makes sense.\n\nMayor Maher stated the petition shows the creativity for housing and access to housing. He stated that basement overlay district was done last term along Mass. Avenue from the Cambridge Common to Porter Square. We are seeing what can be done in these apartments. Mr. Roberts outlined the projects that are ongoing. Mayor Maher stated that there is a provision about the flood zone that the Public Works Commissioner has to sign off if the units are in a flood zone. This has merit and he is grateful that this was brought forward. There is an opportunity to continue to look at this and have adapted the recommendation. Mr. Barrett stated that PART A and B are different. The accessory apartment part could be brought into the Master Plan process but the Part B does not need study by the Master Plan. He is talking about freedom and flexibility to use space in a safe, legal way. \n\nVice Mayor Benzan commended Mr. Barrett. How do we prevent a sell-off of single and two family homes? Mr. Barrett stated that the inclusion of two family structures complicates this proposal and he included two family units to create units. Mr. Barrett stated that in his original proposal he included ownership affidavit. The current ordinance does not require any chain of ownership. \n\nCouncillor Toomey moved that the matter be referred to the full City Council without recommendation. The motion carried on a voice vote of five members.\n\nThe following e-mail was received and made part of the report:\n\nCommunication from Carole Perrault stated that the petition is not ready for prime time and its impact on historical and architectural character of neighborhoods needs to be thoroughly understood (ATTACHMENT G).\n\nVice Mayor Benzan thanked all those present for their attendance.\n\nThe hearing adjourned at 3:52 PM.\n\nFor the Committee,\n\n__________________________________\n\nCouncillor Dennis J.
