Any Mobile On-Demand Fueling Service which shall violate any provision of this section shall be liable for a fine of not more than three hundred dollars and each violation shall constitute a separate offense. 2.\nWhoever violates any provision of this chapter may be penalized by a noncriminal disposition as provided in G.L. c. 40, \u00a721D. For purposes of this section, the Chief of the Fire Department or their designees shall be enforcing persons. E. Severability. It is the intention of the City Council that each separate provision of this chapter shall be deemed independent of all other provisions herein, and it is further the intention of the City Council that if any provision of this chapter be declared to be invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions of this chapter shall remain valid and enforceable.

No such permits will be issued until December 31, 2020 or sooner by further amendment to this section, except for emergency circumstances, significant utility infrastructure projects undertaken pursuant to State or Federal regulations or programs, for City park projects, or where a tree poses significant negative impact to an adjacent existing structure, or for dead or dangerous trees, or where a lot is of such density with existing trees that the removal of certain significant trees is considered beneficial to the health of the tree canopy. Any tree removed in violation of this section,\nprior to December 31, 2020, shall require a payment into the tree replacement fund as per section 8.66.070 according to a schedule as follows: 10% of the replacement value for property owners who qualify for the City of Cambridge residential real property tax exemption, no fee for property owners that receive established forms of financial assistance, and the full replacement cost in all other circumstances. The value to be paid into the tree replacement fund shall be equivalent to the cost of purchasing, planting,\nwatering and maintaining said Replacement Trees for a period of not less than five years.\u201d   RESOLVED: That the City Council go on record expressing a clear intent to pass comprehensive amendments to the TPO, based off the recommendations of the task force, well ahead the new proposed deadline of December 2020.",

            "text": "WHEREAS: The City of Cambridge took numerous aggressive measures at the outset of the covid-19 outbreak that were designed to curb the spread of the virus,\nincluding but not limited to mandating the cessation of the hundreds of construction projects that had already been underway across the city; and  \n  \n   WHEREAS: As the City begins to look ahead to a time when the local economy can begin to re-open, it would be wise to establish guidelines that would allow for the safe resumption of construction activity, and these guidelines would need to balance incorporating the City\u2019s new safety measures with a streamlining of the City\u2019s inspection process to ensure that construction projects can find a viable path forward in a very changed environment; and   WHEREAS: Any guidelines established by the City must make the safety of the construction workers paramount, with the understanding that moving forward under the new safety guidelines will likely increase the length of any given project by as much as 30 percent \u2013 yet having a scaled-back, phased-in approach will allow for a continuation of both the work necessary to complete these construction projects and of the City\u2019s current social-distancing measures; and   WHEREAS: Any steps taken to allow for the resumption of construction in Cambridge must require that all contractors strictly adhere to the rules outlined by the\n[City\u2019s April 2, 2020 Construction Guidelines](https://www.cambridgema.gov/covid19/News/2020/04/constructionguidelines);\nand   WHEREAS: Among the further recommendations that the City should consider for allowing the resumption of construction are the following:\n\n\u00b7 Utilizing emails, video chats, and \u201cas-builts\u201d to enable swift responses from the Inspectional Services Department.\n\n\u00b7 Allowing inspections to be conducted via video conference calls and other electronic measures whenever possible.\n\n\u00b7 Allowing greater latitude for coordinating final inspections (and for determining what constitutes a \u201cfinal inspection\u201d) being jointly conducted by all relevant City Departments, to enable swift turnaround on construction projects.\n\n\u00b7 If the CDD has already submitted substantial conformance documents to the Inspectional Services Department, further re-inspection by the CDD should be waived in favor of allowing this department to grant final approval via email with photos, with turnaround time of no more than 5 business days.\n\n\u00b7 The City should allow all paused projects to submit their covid-19 safety plans to the City now for review, to decrease the anticipated backlog; a lack of formal response from the City within 3 days should be considered an approval from the City \u2013 with the City reserving the right to request further review of any safety plans and the ability to revoke a project\u2019s approval if additional safety measures mandated by the City are not immediately enacted.\n\n\u00b7 The City, which has previously granted permission for construction of 1-3 Family Homes to continue during the covid-19 response, has not allowed construction of Town Homes to continue \u2013 this oversight should be amended and construction on Town Homes should be allowed at this time; and   WHEREAS: On a case-by-case basis, the City should allow projects past the \u201crough inspection\u201d stage to resume construction immediately while following the guidelines outlined above, which would allow the kind of phased-in resumption of construction activities that would still allow for the social distancing the City continues to require; and   WHEREAS: In those construction projections that are essentially a \u201cfit-out\u201d (such as smaller operations that are 3,000 square feet or less), the City should allow the resumption of activities as the work on these projects is typically light,\ncrew sizes should be limited to no more than 10 workers, and operations that are less than 1,000 square feet should be required to limit the crew size to no more than 5 people; and   WHEREAS: In those larger construction projects (such as on the larger hotels in Harvard Square), construction operations should be allowed to continue in accordance with the guidelines established by the City on April 2, 2020 with the City providing some additional guidelines beyond those issued on April 2, 2020 for occupant safety when projects include construction in occupied residential or business spaces; and   WHEREAS: By taking the recommendations listed above under consideration, the City can begin to formulate an actionable plan that will allow construction projects to safely and responsibly resume operations, streamlining the City\u2019s process of moving construction projects forward, and providing a critical portion of the local economy a roadmap of how to move forward as the City continues to respond to the challenges posed by covid-19; now therefore be it   ORDERED: That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to review the recommendations listed above with the appropriate City personnel with a view toward establishing clear guidelines that will allow for the re-opening of construction projects across the City, and to report back to the City Council on this matter as soon as possible.   ORDERED: That this order be forwarded to the Cambridge Construction Advisory Group.",

PASSED TO A SECOND READING IN COUNCIL JULY 27, 2020.  TO BE ORDAINED ON OR AFTER SEPTEMBER 14, 2020",
            "text": "ORDERED: That section 2.119 of the Ordinances of the City of Cambridge, titled Domestic Partnerships be amended to read as follows:\n Chapter 2.119 - DOMESTIC PARTNERSHIPS\n\n  \n 2.119.010 - Recognition and scope.\n A. The City Council recognizes the diverse composition of its citizenry and values its people. The City Council acknowledges that the people's lives have evolved from when laws governing family relationships were enacted.\nPerpetuation of the traditional definitions of \"family\" excludes a significant segment of the Cambridge population, deprives them of recognition and validation, and denies certain rights that should be afforded to persons who share their homes, their hearts and their lives. The City, recognizing its commitment to nondiscrimination and fair treatment of its citizens and employees, adopts this chapter acknowledging domestic partnerships.\n B. The chapter allows persons in committed relationships who meet the criteria established by the City as constituting domestic partnerships to register at the office of the City Clerk and obtain a certificate attesting to their status. The chapter recognizes certain right of access for domestic partners.\nThis chapter, in conformance with the Human Rights Ordinance, which bars discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, marital status and family status, also equalizes the treatment of City employees.\n\n  \n 2.119.020 - Definitions.\n As used in this chapter:\n A. \"Competent to contract\" means eighteen years of age or older, and mentally competent to contract.\n B. \"Dependent\" means a minor who lives within the household of a domestic partnership and is:\n 1. A biological child or adopted child, or foster child of a domestic partner, if the child is not provided with medical insurance coverage by the Commonwealth; \n 2. A dependent as defined under IRS regulations; or \n 3. A ward of a domestic partner as determined in a guardianship proceeding. \n C. \"Domestic partner\" means a person who meets the criteria set out in subsection D of this section or who is registered as such in another jurisdiction.\n D. \"Domestic partnership\" means the entity formed by two or more persons who meet the following criteria and jointly file a registration statement proclaiming that:\n 1. They are in a relationship of mutual support, caring and commitment and intend to remain in such a relationship; and \n 2. They are not related by blood closer than would bar marriage in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts; and \n 3. They are competent to contract; and \n 4. They consider themselves to be a family. \n E. \"Mutual support\" means that the domestic partners each contributed in some fashion, not necessarily equally or financially, to the maintenance and support of the domestic partnership.\n\n(Ord. 1144 (part), 1992)\n\n  \n 2.119.030 - Registration and withdrawal.\n A. Persons who meet the criteria set out in subsection D of Section 2.119.020 may make an official record of their domestic partnership by filing a domestic partnership registration form with the City Clerk. The domestic partnership registration shall include the name and date of birth of each of the domestic partners, and the name and dates of birth of any dependents of the domestic partnership, and shall be signed, under the pains and penalties of perjury, by all domestic partners.\n B. Domestic partners may amend the domestic partnership registration to add or delete domestic partners or dependents. Amendments to the domestic partnership registration shall be signed, under the pains and penalties of perjury, by all domestic partners.\n C. If any member of the domestic partnership is married or in another domestic partnership, notice of the registration of this domestic partnership and/or of the addition of new partner(s) to this domestic partnership must be given, by certified mail, to any marital or domestic partners outside of this domestic partnership.\n D. Any person in a domestic partnership may voluntarily withdraw from the domestic partnership by filing a withdrawal statement.\n 1. Any person in a domestic partnership may voluntarily withdraw from the domestic partnership by filing with the City Clerk, by hand or by certified mail, a withdrawal statement. The person filing the withdrawal statement must declare under pains and penalties of perjury that they are withdrawing from the domestic partnership and that a copy of the withdrawal statement has been mailed by certified mail to the other domestic partners at his, her or their last known addresses. The person filing the withdrawal statement must include on such statement the address(es) to which the copy(ies) were/was mailed. The fee for a domestic partnership withdrawal shall be $5.00. \n 2. The death of a domestic partner functions as an automatic withdrawal from the domestic partnership as to that partner.\n E. If there are only two persons in the domestic partnership, withdrawal of one person terminates the domestic partnership. If there are more than two persons in the domestic partnership, withdrawal of one partner does not terminate the domestic partnership as to the remaining persons in the domestic partnership. The voluntary withdrawal from a domestic partnership by a partner shall be effective seven days after the receipt of a withdrawal statement by the City Clerk. Prior to becoming effective, the person who filed the withdrawal statement may retract the withdrawal statement as follows: in person at the office of the City Clerk; or via certified mail addressed to the City Clerk, provided the retraction is received no later than seven days following the date the withdrawal statement was filed. If the withdrawal statement is retracted, the domestic partner shall give notice of the retraction, by certified mail, to the other domestic partner(s). The withdrawal of a deceased person from a domestic partnership shall be effective immediately upon the death of that domestic partner.\n F. If a domestic partnership is terminated by the death of a domestic partner,\nthere shall be no required waiting period prior to filing another domestic partnership.

The initial amount for this fee shall be fifteen dollars and it shall be adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with the fee for an application for a marriage license.\n B. The City Clerk shall collect the same fee charged for marriage certificates for certified copies of domestic partnership documents, other than the copy of the certificate of domestic partnership issued by the City Clerk to the domestic partners, as provided for in Section 2.119.050.\n 2.119.050 - City Clerk\u2014Records.\n A. Upon receipt of a domestic partnership registration and filing fee, the City Clerk shall issue a certificate of domestic partnership and shall mail to each of the domestic partners one certified copy of the certificate and one wallet-sized card indicating the existence of the domestic partnership, the names of the domestic partners and the names of the dependents of the domestic partnership, if any.\n B. The City Clerk shall maintain records of domestic partnerships registered in the City, including forms filed and certificates issued. The City Clerk shall provide forms to persons requesting them in accordance with Section 2.119.120.\n C. The City Clerk shall allow public access to domestic partnership records to the same extent and in the same manner as marriage licenses.\n\n  \n 2.119.060 - Rights of domestic partners.\n Persons who have registered their domestic partnership at the office of the City Clerk pursuant to Section 2.119.030 are entitled to the following rights:\n A.\n 1.

The school shall afford such person access as directed by the child's parent. \n 2. When a domestic partnership is terminated pursuant to Section 2.119.030, it is the responsibility of the parent or guardian to notify the school, in writing, of the termination of rights of the former domestic partner. \n 3. The term \"school\" includes, but is not limited to, high schools, vocational schools, junior high and middle schools, elementary schools, preschool programs, after-school programs and day care programs. \n\n  \n 2.119.070 - Employment benefits.\n A.

As used in this chapter, \"employees\" refers to active and retired employees of the City and the Cambridge School Department eligible for benefits pursuant to state or municipal law, employment policies or collective bargaining agreements.\n B.

            "text": "WHEREAS: In 1973, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on Roe v. Wade, which recognized the fundamental principle that women\u2019s bodies are their own and guaranteed all people the right to safe and legal abortion; and  \n  \n   WHEREAS: An individual\u2019s freedom to make reproductive decisions is vital to their safety, well-being, economic opportunity, and ability to participate equally in society; and   WHEREAS: The constitutional right to abortion does not translate into equitable access to care as barriers to access are entrenched in discrimination, stigma, and political interference to keep safe, legal abortion out of reach and unaffordable for many people; and   WHEREAS: Nearly 1 in 4 women will have an abortion, but when denied abortion due to these barriers, women and their families suffer from well-being and economic opportunity, where studies have shown that a person denied access to abortion is more likely to fall into poverty than a person who can receive abortion;\nand   WHEREAS: Since 2011, politicians have passed over 400 new laws in 33 states to shame,\npressure, and punish people seeking abortion; and   WHEREAS: These attacks have been bolstered by the current administration\u2019s assault on health care access and reproductive rights; and   WHEREAS: Even in Massachusetts, access to safe, legal abortion is still dictated by a person\u2019s income, insurance status, and whether a young person\u2019s household supports their right to make their own, private medical decisions; and   WHEREAS: With a U.S. Supreme Court ripely poised to further erode or eliminate Roe v.\nWade, Massachusetts must strengthen its commitment to reproductive rights and modernize its laws so every person has access to safe, legal abortion and can decide for themselves if and when to become a parent; and   WHEREAS: Senator Harriette L. Chandler and Representatives Patricia A. Haddad and Jay D. Livingstone have introduced the Roe Act (S. 1209, H. 3320) to address these inequalities and ensure safe abortion access in Massachusetts; and   WHEREAS: The Roe Act will improve access to affordable abortion by removing unnecessary, burdensome provisions that delay and deny care by:\n\n\u00b7 Eliminating the burdensome judicial bypass process teenagers must navigate to access safe, legal abortion, aligning young people\u2019s ability to access abortion with their ability to access all other pregnancy-related care;\n\n\u00b7 Bolstering access to safety-net coverage for abortion regardless of a resident\u2019s income or legal status, which already exists for all other pregnancy-related care;\n\n\u00b7 Expanding access to abortion after 24 weeks of pregnancy in cases of fatal fetal anomalies;\n\n\u00b7 Eliminating unwarranted government intrusions and criminal penalties;\n\n\u00b7 Ending intrusive reporting requirements that jeopardize physician safety and patient privacy; and\n\n\u00b7 Reforming state laws and language to codify principles of reproductive freedom; now therefore be it   RESOLVED: That the City Council go on record supporting the Roe Act and restate its commitment to the protection of abortion rights, reproductive health care rights, and individuals\u2019 rights to make reproductive decisions about their own bodies; and be it further;   RESOLVED: That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward suitably engrossed copies of this Resolution to U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, U.S. Senator Edward J.

            "text": "WHEREAS: Across Massachusetts and in the City, food insecurity has skyrocketed amid mass layoffs and business closures, and 15,080 Cambridge residents, or 13% of all Cambridge residents, are currently experiencing food-insecurity; and  \n  \n   WHEREAS: Of these residents, 7,338 are impacted by the SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) Gap, the difference between the number of low-income residents receiving MassHealth who are likely eligible for SNAP, and the number of people actually receiving SNAP; and   WHEREAS: The SNAP Gap places an immense burden on our local food pantries, who have,\nanecdotally, seen a 10-15% increase in pantry use during the past few months,\nand who are struggling to keep up with the growing need in our community; and   WHEREAS: Government food assistance programs, like SNAP, serve as a longer-term, more sustainable intervention to hunger that also accommodates recipients\u2019 cultural and medical dietary needs more easily and provides economic stimulus in the communities they are used in, but many residents may not fully understand how to access the benefits they are eligible for, or may struggle to complete the tedious process of filing an application for SNAP; and   WHEREAS: On December 4th, the Fiscal Year 2021 Budget Conference report passed in the Massachusetts Legislature, which would authorize the Baker administration to use $5,000,000 to develop a \u2018common application\u2019 that would allow MassHealth applicants and recipients to submit an application for SNAP at the same time they are applying for medical assistance, and which is currently awaiting approval from the Governor; and   WHEREAS: The Massachusetts Legislature also authorized the Executive Office of Health and Human Services to use $5,000,000 to create such a common application system enabling MassHealth applicants to simultaneously submit a SNAP application in [An Act Financing the General Governmental Infrastructure of the Commonwealth](https://malegislature.gov/Laws/SessionLaws/Acts/2020/Chapter151)\n(\u201cIT Bond Bill\u201d); and   WHEREAS: By streamlining the application process and making it easier for residents to access critical food assistance benefits, a common application would help support our low-income, food-insecure residents during their time of great need; now therefore be it   RESOLVED: That the City Council go on record as urging Governor Baker to adopt the Fiscal Year 2021 Budget Conference report and move forward with creating a streamlined \u201ccommon application\u201d to help expand access to and participation in SNAP; and be it further   ORDERED: That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a suitably engrossed copy of this resolution to Governor Baker, Secretary Sudders, Assistant Secretary Tsai, and the Cambridge legislative delegation on behalf of the entire City Council.",

Statement of Goals and Guidelines and Standards for Review\n The Goal of the District and of this Order is to protect the Harvard Square Conservation District\u2019s distinctive physical and experiential characteristics and to enhance the livability and vital- ity of the District. The Historical Commission should seek to enhance the unique physical environment and visual form of the District; preserve its architecturally and historically significant structures and their settings; encourage creative design that contributes to the richness of its environment; mitigate character-diminishing impacts of new development; and discourage homogeneity by encouraging diversity of development and open space patterns and building scales and ages.\nThe District must remain a pedestrian-friendly, accessible, human-scale,\nquirky, mixed-use environment that supports dynamic urban experiences,\ncomplements nearby neighborhoods, and respects the history and traditions of its location.\n The following Secondary Goals for the District are intended to provide general guidance in a wide variety of situations, and are not intended to be applied to every project. They are statements of policy, not prescriptive measures that must be applied equally in each situation.\n 1. Significant Buildings. Preserve historically or architecturally significant buildings and structures as well as those that contribute to the distinctive visual character or historical significance of the District.\n 2. Sustain the vitality of the commercial environment. Sustain the vitality of the commercial environment while preserving architecturally-significant or original building fabric at street level and above. Encourage the restoration of missing features where these have been documented. Except for protected storefronts, encourage creative contemporary commercial design inside the restored framework of storefront openings. Encourage creative signage. Support below-grade commercial spaces where appropriate. Regardless of use, encourage architectural solutions that preserve storefront fabric, transparency, and utility.\n 3. Contemporary Design. Where context allows, support creative, contemporary design for new construction that complements the context of abutting buildings and enhances the character of the subdistrict. Recognize and respect well-reasoned contemporary design during the review process. Support innovative approaches to enhancing the unique character of Harvard Square while mitigating the detrimental impacts of development on proximate areas.\n 4. Diversity of Form. Build on and sustain the diversity of existing building form, scale and material. Preserve and encourage appropriate green spaces, scale-appropriate open spaces, and new buildings that support the prevailing character of the subdistrict. Pre- serve the remaining wood frame buildings throughout the District. Maintain a consistent setback or streetwall condition where that character has been set. Support small-scale storefronts to preserve the vitality and character of the streetscape.\n 5. Public Environment. Create a high-quality public environment in the District with compatible materials, lighting, signage, and street furniture such as bollards, benches, move- able seating, and the like. Provide adequate facilities for trash and recycling and surfaces that can be cleaned and maintained. Encourage planted greenspaces and accommodate trees where possible.\n 6. Pedestrian Experience. Protect and enhance the pedestrian experience. Expand the net- work of pedestrian walkways and paths wherever they can conveniently provide alternate routes through the District. Increase public access to alleys and interior spaces where appropriate and upgrade the paving and landscaping of such spaces. Enhance accessibility and safety for pedestrians throughout the District.\n 7. Residential Development. Enhance the all-hours neighborhood quality of Harvard Square by supporting existing residential uses and encouraging additional residential units in mixed-use buildings.\n 8. Compatible Design. Encourage compatible design that supports a wide diversity of uses serving the needs of surrounding neighborhoods, students, workers and visitors from around the world.\n 9. Transportation. Encourage creative solutions to the District\u2019s transportation issues by providing balanced accommodations for through and local traffic, cyclists, and pedestri- ans. Promote smooth movement of traffic on through streets and seek creative design and management solutions for side streets where traffic volume and speeds can be regulated to give highest priority to pedestrians. Provide adequate bicycle parking throughout the District. Protect pedestrian safety and experience through careful design and place- ment of features such as loading docks, curb cuts, and receptacles for trash and recy- cling. Encourage replacement of surface parking lots with compatible new structures. Discourage provision of on-site parking for new construction.\n 10. Environmental Sustainability. Encourage environmentally sustainable development that takes into consideration the embodied energy of the existing built environment, material life cycles, passive design, energy conservation, and current standards for best energy conservation practices. Alterations to existing buildings that seek to promote energy conservation should be accomplished in a manner that respects character-defining mate- rials and designs.\n 11. Architectural lighting. Architectural (building fa\u00e7ade) lighting, streetscape lighting, and signage lighting, when allowed by a Certificate of Appropriateness, should reinforce definitive characteristics of historic and contemporary architecture as well as create high quality 24-hour streetscapes. To achieve these goals, projects should minimize bright- ness, and light trespass, monitor light color (temperature Kelvin), and focus lighting on significant features.\n The foregoing goals also recite the standards for preservation and change within the District. In addition to the factors specified in Section 2.78.220,\nand subject to any specific provisions of this Order, in exercising its authority with respect to the District and in considering applications for certificates of appropriateness, hardship, or nonapplicability, the Historical Commission shall be guided by the preceding general goal for the District as a whole and by such of the pre- ceding secondary goals as it determines to be applicable to the project or situation before it.\n The Historical Commission shall also be guided by the standards and guidelines described in the \u201cFinal Report of the Harvard Square Neighborhood Conservation District Study Committee,\u201d dated November 29, 2000, as amended by the \u201cFinal Report of the 2017-19 Harvard Square\n Conservation District Study Committee,\u201d which after public hearing the Historical Commission may adopt as regulations and thereafter amend from time to time.\n In addition, the Historical Commission and project proponents shall consider the amended goals and guidelines specific to each of the seven subdistricts that make up the Harvard Square Conservation District. The subdistrict goals and guidelines describe the physical and historical development of each area over time, identify notable buildings and spaces, and set forth preservation priorities and recommendations for each sub-district.\n As permitted by Chapter 2.78.190.B, the Historical Commission may determine from time to time after public hearing that certain categories of exterior architectural features, structures, or signs may be altered without review by the Commission; provided, however, that every such alteration shall be determined by the Executive Director of the Historical Commission to con- form to the regulations adopted by the Commission for the administration of the District.",

Now therefore be\n ORDERED: That the KSURP zoning petition filed on September 17, 2020 is hereby amended by substitution with the following language:\n Petition Language: To amend Article 14 of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance\n MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT: KENDALL CENTER\n KEY\n Language additions are underlined.\n Language deletions are shown with strikethrough text.\n Amended language is shown with bold and double underlined text.\n Introduction:\n When Eversource announced its plans for a new electrical substation on Fulkerson Street, the City Manager asked City and CRA staff, as well as representatives from the local development community, to explore an alternative site for the facility. After the numerous hearings held by City Council regarding the substation proposal, Boston Properties (BXP) approached the City and CRA about the idea of placing the substation on the site of the existing \u201cBlue Garage\u201d within the MXD District of the Kendall Square Urban Renewal Project Area. Although this alternate site is highly preferred to the Fulkerson Street location, there are nonetheless many complex technical challenges associated with relocating the substation to this parcel. It involves not only the design of the substation and high voltage access routes to the location, but also completing plans for the housing program currently outlined in the Infill Development Concept Plan, fulfilling interim and future parking requirements, and designing locations for additional development to provide financial support for this alternative location.\n The CRA hereby submits this zoning petition to amend the Article 14 of the Cambridge Zoning Ordinance: MXD Development District: Kendall Center in order to accommodate the relocation of the Eversource substation to the BXP site.\nCorresponding changes will also be required to the Kendall Square Urban Renewal Plan. These changes would affirm the regional utility infrastructure land use in the district, as well as provide for additional development rights and make adjustments to some dimensional restrictions to facilitate the alternative site.\n 1. Replace the current Subsection 14.21.7(6) with the following text:\n 14.21.7(6) Transformer station, substation, gas regulator station, or pumping station and related utility uses designed primarily to serve development within the District.\n 2. Replace first three paragraphs of current Subsection 14.32.1 with the text below: \n 14.32.1 The Aggregate gross floor area (GFA) of development in the District shall not exceed the sum of (i) three million, six hundred seventy three thousand (3,673,000) four million, four hundred seventy three thousand\n(4,473,000) square feet, plus (ii) six hundred thousand (600,000) square feet that shall be limited to multi-family residential uses as permitted in Section 14.21.4(1), for a total Aggregate GFA not to exceed four million, two hundred seventy three thousand (4,273,000) five million, seventy three thousand\n(5,073,000) square feet. Up to sixty thousand (60,000) square feet of such Aggregate GFA of three million, six hundred seventy three thousand (3,673,000)\nfour million, four hundred seventy three thousand (4,473,000) in clause (i) of the preceding sentence, shall be allowable only by special permit pursuant to Section 14.72.\n At least two hundred thousand (200,000) square feet of the GFA restricted to housing uses shall occur only within the area designated on the Zoning Map as the \u201cAmes Street District\u201d and has been approved by special permit dated March 27,2015 (the \u201cAmes Street Residential Project\u201d). The commencement of construction for the Ames Street Residential Project, approved by special permit in 2015, shall precede the occupancy of any commercial GFA in excess of three million and seventy-three thousand (3,073,000) square feet, other than the 60,000 square feet of commercial space that may be permitted by special permit pursuant to Section 14.72.3.\n Additionally, the commencement of construction of a second residential project of at least 200,000 square feet shall precede the occupancy of any commercial GFA utilizing Infill GFA (as defined in Section 14.32.2 below) in excess of three hundred and seventy-five thousand (375,000) square feet.\n Additionally, a building permit for construction of a residential project of at least four hundred thousand (400,000) square feet shall be issued prior to or concurrently with the issuance of a building permit for any project utilizing Substation Commercial Utility Project GFA (as defined in Section 14.32.2 below). The design review process for a residential project of at least four hundred thousand (400,000) square feet shall also precede, or proceed concurrently with, the design review process for any project utilizing Substation Commercial Utility Project GFA, in accordance with a special permit approving a Concept Plan as set forth in Section 14.32.2 below.\n 3\\. Add the following paragraph to the end of Subsection 14.32.2:\n Any additional Infill GFA for commercial uses that is not the subject of the existing Concept Plan approved by Special Permit PB #315 on March 20, 2017 (as amended by Amendment #1 (Major) dated January 31, 2019) (collectively, the\n\u201cExisting Concept Plan\u201d) may only be utilized in conjunction with the development by NSTAR Electric Company d/b/a Eversource (or its successors and assigns) of a substation within the District (\u201cthe Substation Project\u201d) and only on property within the District owned by the entity (or an affiliate thereof) that provided the land on which the Substation Project is to be developed. For the purposes of this Article, the eight hundred thousand\n(800,000) square feet of Infill GFA for commercial uses that is not the subject of the Existing Concept Plan may sometimes be referred to as\n\u201cSubstation Commercial Utility Project GFA\u201d. The issuance of a building permit for the Substation Project shall precede or be issued concurrently with the issuance of a building permit for any project utilizing Substation Commercial Utility Project GFA.\n The MXD District is expected to achieve high standards for urban design,\narchitectural design, environmental sustainability and open space design, and to transform the area into a recognizable center of activity and civic life for Kendall Square and the surrounding neighborhoods. The District should create open space to serve residents in the area, as well as workers, students from nearby institutions, and visitors. It should promote permeability at the edges of the District, and create public spaces that will feel welcoming and comfortable for all users.\n 4. Replace current Subsection 14.32.2.1(8) and 14.32.2.1(9) with the following text:\n 14.32.2.1 Infill Development Concept Plan Requirements:\n 8) A plan describing street, public infrastructure, and utility improvements to be undertaken in coordination with the development program, including all proposed water, stormwater and sewage facilities, and (in conjunction with the Substation Project) the general location of the proposed substation, which shall also be submitted to the Department of Public Works for review.\n 9)  A plan illustrating proposed building scale, height and massing, including a model and a study demonstrating the anticipated shadow and wind impacts of all proposed buildings taller than 100 feet, and a general description of proposed mitigation measures that will be employed. Additionally a set of urban design guidelines to be utilized in the design review process shall be included the plan will include a narrative describing the plan\u2019s compatibility, coordination and consistency with the urban design guidelines set forth in the Kendall Square Final Report of the K2C2 Planning Study (\u201cK2 Guidelines\u201d) and the Volpe Working Group\u2019s Planning & Design Principles dated July 20, 2017 (the \u201cVolpe Guidelines\u201d) and the planning principles referenced in Section 14.32.2.\n 5.

The Planning Board shall grant a special permit approving a Concept Plan upon finding that the new development identified within the plan meets the criteria for approval of a Planned Unit Development set forth in Section 12.35.3(3) of the Zoning Ordinance and the criteria for approval of a Project Review Special Permit set forth in Section 19.25 of the Zoning Ordinance. In making its findings, the Board shall consider the objectives set forth in the Kendall Square Final Report of the K2C2 Planning Study (\"K2 Plan\") K2 Guidelines and the Volpe Guidelines and the Kendall Square Design Guidelines. The approval of a Concept Plan shall serve to meet any applicable project review requirements of Article 19.000, and no additional Project Review Special Permit shall be required for new development that is identified within an approved Concept Plan. In addition, while the location of the Substation Project is to be shown on a Concept Plan, the actual development of the Substation Project shall not be included within the scope of a special permit approving a Concept Plan (but shall remain subject to all applicable regulations governing the construction of such projects).\n 6. Add the following new Subsection 14.32.5(d) at the end of Subsection 14.32.5:\n d) Inapplicability to Substation Commercial Utility Project GFA.\nNotwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 14.32.5. there shall be no Innovation Space requirement for any project utilizing Substation Commercial Utility Project GFA (nor shall any such project utilizing Substation Commercial Utility Project GFA be entitled to utilize Innovation Space in order to obtain a GFA Exemption under Section 14.32.6(3) below).\n 7\\.  Replace current Subsection 14.32.6(2) and 14.32.6(3) with the following text:\n 2) Residential Outdoor Area Exemptions: Private outdoor decks or balconies for multi-family residential or commercial development, up to eight percent (8%)\nof the building floor area.\n 3) Innovation Space: Innovation Space GFA up to the lesser of either twenty percent (20%) of the Infill GFA dedicated to Office and Biotechnology Manufacturing Uses or one hundred five thousand (105,000) square feet. In order for the Innovation Space GFA to be exempt from the Aggregate GFA limitations, at least twenty five percent (25%) of the Innovation Space utilization (measured by square footage or shared space membership) must be set aside as below market rate space to be offered by the CRA or the City to qualifying tenants for short-term leases consistent with Section 14.32.5(b).\n 8. Add the following new Subsections 14.32.6(7) and 14.32.6(8) at the end of Subsection 14.32.6:\n 7)  Electrical Substation: The Substation Project shall be exempt from Aggregate GFA calculation as well as the requirements as to Floor Area Ratio.\nFurther, substation construction shall not constitute Infill GFA (or Substation Commercial Utility Project GFA).\n 8) Educational Lab, Classroom or Training Facility: Up to twenty thousand\n(20,000) square feet of educational, health or workforce training facilities operated to provide services to the general public (as opposed to private facilities that are solely accessible by tenants or occupants of commercial buildings within the District), which such services are either permitted as of right within the District in accordance with the provisions of this Article 14 or may otherwise be permitted by special permit.\n 9. Add the following new paragraph at the end of Section 14.33: \n Notwithstanding the provisions of the immediately preceding paragraph, there shall be no maximum floor area ratio for any project utilizing Infill GFA\n(including Substation Commercial Utility Project GFA). However, the District Development Limitations in Section 14.32 shall continue to apply.\n 10. Replace first paragraph of Section 14.34 with the following text: \n 14.34 Building Height Limitation.\n The maximum building height in the District shall be two hundred and fifty\n(250) feet, except for the area of the District more than four hundred and fifty (450) feet north of the centerline of Broadway, where the maximum building height for any portion of a building in such area shall be two hundred (200) feet. Up to two (2) mixed-use buildings may reach three hundred and fifty (350) feet provided, however, that the occupied floors above two hundred and fifty (250) feet may only contain residential and associated amenity space. Additionally, the floorplate of any portion of a building above two hundred and fifty (250) feet shall not exceed twelve thousand (12,000)\nsquare feet.\n The maximum building height in the District shall be two hundred and fifty\n(250) feet. Notwithstanding the foregoing, one building within the District may reach four hundred (400) feet provided, however, that the occupied floors above two hundred and fifty feet (250) feet may only contain residential and associated amenity space. Additionally, the floorplate of any portion of a building above two hundred fifty (250) feet shall not exceed twelve thousand five hundred (12,500) square feet.\n 11. Replace current Section 14.38 with the following text:\n 14.38 Active Ground Floors. The ground floor of newly constructed buildings utilizing fifty thousand (50,000) square feet or more of Infill GFA, where that ground floor fronts onto Main Street, Broadway or Ames Street, must be occupied by (i) Retail and Consumer Service uses, as listed in Section 14.21.3, or (ii) active public gathering space (whether enclosed or open),\nalong a minimum length of seventy-five percent (75%) of the building fa\u00e7ade along this frontage; provided, however, that the requirement shall be forty percent (40%) for any building with a fa\u00e7ade length of one hundred (100) feet or less along such frontage onto Main Street, Broadway or Ames Street.\nDimensional variations and alternate uses may be approved by the Planning Board upon determining that the specific uses and designs proposed are consistent with the purpose and intent of this Section 14.38. Alternatively,\nif a Concept Plan provides for the redevelopment of existing buildings to include new Retail and Consumer Service uses along the ground floor of any of the identified street frontages, then the Planning Board may permit a reduction in the required length of active street frontage for new buildings for up to fifty percent (50%) of the length of new active street frontage provided in existing buildings and only if the Board finds that it results in a better outcome for the District as a whole. Banks and financial institutions shall not be considered active ground floor uses for the purposes of meeting this requirement.\n 12. Replace current Section 14.39 with the following text:\n 14.39 Letter of Commitment.\n The Letter of Commitment dated December 21, 2015 by Boston Properties Limited Partnership is incorporated herein by reference and shall be binding upon Boston Properties Limited Partnership and its successor and assigns.\n It is acknowledged and agreed that the Letter of Commitment dated December 21,\n2015 by Boston Properties Limited Partnership is hereby replaced by the Letter of Commitment dated January xx, 2021 by the Cambridge Redevelopment Authority.\nAs such, the Letter of Commitment dated December 21, 2015 by Boston Properties is declared null and void and of no further force or effect, and shall no longer be binding upon Boston Properties Limited Partnership or its successors and assigns.\n 13. Replace the first paragraph of Subsection 14.52.2 with the following text:\n 14.52.2 With the exception of multi-family residential development, there are no minimum parking requirements for new development in the District.\nResidential development shall provide at a minimum 0.4 0.25 automobile parking spaces per dwelling unit. All proposed development shall be restricted from constructing parking spaces, either on or off the lot within the District,\nbeyond the maximum allowances of Table 1. If a development includes more than one category of use, then the number of spaces allowed for the development shall be the sum of the allowance for each category of use. Where the computation of required spaces results in a fractional number, only a fraction of one half or more shall be counted as one. The Planning Board may approve arrangements for shared parking of such residential parking spaces with commercial spaces or otherwise adjust the minimum parking requirements based on review and analysis of anticipated parking demand within the Transportation Impact Study.\n 14. Replace current Subsection 14.52.3 with the following text:\n 14.52.3 The parking allowances specified in Table 1 may be satisfied by a lease agreement between the developer and the City, other public entity, or private consortium for use of parking spaces in a public or pooled private parking facility located within the District (or, in the case of the spaces required for residential uses, located outside of the District but within one thousand (1,000) two thousand (2,000) feet of the residential building for which the parking is being provided, measured from property edge to property edge), provided that on a temporary basis, spaces required for residential uses may be within two thousand (2,000) feet of the residential building while permanent residential parking is being constructed. The total number of parking spaces leased and constructed within the district for development on a lot shall not exceed the maximum allowances provided for in Table 2.\n 15. Replace current Subsection 14.52.6 with the following text:\n 14.52.6 Bicycle Parking: Bike parking shall be provided as set forth in Section 6.100 of this Zoning Ordinance; provided that in issuing a special permit approving a Concept Plan, the Planning Board may determine that the bicycle parking requirements for individual buildings shown on the Concept Plan may be met utilizing a campus planning approach toward bicycle parking.\n 14.52.6.1 Intent: To allow flexibility within the high-density environment of the MXD District while providing high quality, equitable, and thoughtfully planned bicycle parking and sustainable transportation amenities for all users, consistent with Section 6.108.2. Given the complexity of infrastructure requirements of the Substation Project, the bicycle parking provisions set forth in Section 6.100 is infeasible, and a comprehensive bicycle parking plan will be needed to help to balance space constraints and competing uses on or near the ground level.\n 14.52.6.2 Bike Parking Plan: The bicycle parking plan may utilize a combination of the following strategies, or other design provisions that meet the principles of Section 6.108.3:\n a) Public Bicycle Sharing Facilities: Where a new, standard-size Public Bicycle Sharing Station or larger is provided (i) on the lot, or (ii) on a site within five hundred (500) feet of the lot, with written approval of the City if located on a public street or other City Property, or otherwise by legally enforceable mutual agreement with the owner of the land on which the station is to be located. If Public Bicycle Sharing Station(s) are provided,\neach bicycle dock within that station may count for up to two (2) required bicycle parking spaces.\n Should it be deemed beneficial to the operation of a Public Bicycle Sharing system by the Community Development Department and the Public Bicycle Sharing system operator, a developer may meet additional bicycle parking requirements by providing a secure, accessible and geographically central location for the storage and/or maintenance of the publicly shared bicycles. If a Public Bicycle Sharing storage and/or maintenance facility is provided, each designated bicycle storage space shall count for up to one-half (0.5) of a required bicycle parking space\n b) Countercyclical Bicycle Parking Facility: As the District will contain residential and commercial uses having different peak parking demand times,\nmultiple buildings may share parking facilities within three hundred (300)\nfeet from each other. A shared bicycle parking space may count as a required bicycle parking space for both a residential use and a commercial use within separate buildings within a campus plan.\n c) Complementary Valet Bicycle Parking: Bicycle parking may be provided through a valet bicycle parking program that is offered free of charge to users. In order to utilize valet bicycle parking, a developer must submit for the Planning Board\u2019s approval a plan describing:\n i. The design of the valet bicycle parking facilities (which shall not be required to conform with the dimensional regulations of Section 6.100).\n ii. The proposed number of attendants, number of bicycle parking spaces provided, hours of valet service operations, and other pertinent information.\n When an approved valet bicycle parking program that was utilized to meet the requirements of Section 6.100 is discontinued, the property owner must either bring the bicycle parking spaces into full conformance with the bicycle parking requirements of Section 6.100 or seek approval from the Planning Board for an alternative approach.\n The combination of the strategies above, or other provisions accepted by the Planning Board, shall allow a project to adjust the minimum required number of bicycle parking spaces, as supported through analysis made available to the Planning Board.",

            "text": "WHEREAS: The climate crisis continues to worsen and disproportionately impacts the most vulnerable members of our community; and\n WHEREAS: To effectively respond to this crisis, we need to completely decarbonize the US economy in the next ten years by enacting a Green New Deal at every level of government; and\n WHEREAS: Cambridge\u2019s extraordinary financial position and status as a global center of innovation represent a mandate for the city to truly lead the way on the most pressing issue of our time; and\n WHEREAS: Cambridge is a true leader on constructing all electric net zero ready and net zero emissions municipal buildings, including the King Open/Cambridge Street Upper School Complex, but the vast majority of the city\u2019s emissions come from commercial buildings, including especially laboratory buildings, which means total emissions have only continued to increase over time as we\u2019ve added many millions of new square feet of commercial development; and\n WHEREAS: All the technological and economic feasibility now exists to build all-electric net zero emissions buildings in Cambridge; and\n WHEREAS: While almost all of our building emissions come from the existing building stock, decarbonizing existing buildings is expensive and difficult,\nso we need to mandate net zero new construction as soon as possible; and\n WHEREAS: On December 11, 2019, the Ordinance Committee of the Cambridge City Council voted to refer a proposed ordinance banning natural gas combustion in new buildings to the full City Council with a favorable recommendation; and\n WHEREAS: Attorney General Maura Healey struck down Brookline\u2019s proposed bylaw to ban natural gas hookups in new construction via the building code, making it legally challenging for Cambridge to adopt the proposed ordinance without a home rule petition; and\n WHEREAS: The Cambridge Green New Deal Zoning Petition (attached) would provide a framework for accepting local emissions offsets to strengthen green jobs programs and energy efficiency upgrades to the existing building stock,\ncreating economic opportunity for our most vulnerable residents who are too often left behind; and\n WHEREAS: The Cambridge Green New Deal Zoning Petition would exempt all new housing construction, which is not a significant driver of emissions, while creating opportunities to improve energy efficiency and renewable energy deployment in the existing housing stock; and\n WHEREAS: The Cambridge City Council is committed to rapid decarbonization in a way that creates economic opportunity and climate justice for our most vulnerable residents; now therefore be it\n ORDERED: That the City Council amend the Article 22 of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Cambridge entitled \u201cSUSTAINABLE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT\u201d to insert a new section 22.24.4 to read as follows:\n 22.24.4 Emissions Accounting.\n The provisions in this section shall not apply to any residential buildings that include affordable units.\n a. Embodied Emissions: As a condition of receiving an occupancy permit, the developer shall provide to CDD an accounting of the emissions generated by the construction of any Green Building Project. The Embodied Emissions shall be documented by a licensed engineer, using Passive House or other acceptable energy and emissions modeling software, and include:\n\n    1. Emissions for manufacturing all building materials used, including associated raw materials extraction, production and transportation.\n\n    2. Estimates for transportation emissions caused by delivering the materials to the construction site.\n\n    3. Emissions generated on the site by heavy equipment such as cranes.\n b. The Embodied Emissions shall not include:\n\n    1. Emissions associated with installing renewable energy facilities on site, including but not limited to solar PV and solar hot water, air source and ground source heat pumps, and any other systems that substantially reduce the future emissions of the building.\n\n    2. Emissions generated from human labor (e.g. individual transport, small power tools, food consumption, etc.).\n\n    3. Emissions for transporting landscaping materials and plants to the site.\n\n    4. Emissions associated with installing electric vehicle charging infrastructure (EVSE).\n c. Expected Annual Emissions. The developer shall present an accounting of the expected emissions to be generated by routine operation of the building over the course of one calendar year. Emissions will be calculated as metric tons of CO2 equivalent using a formula approved by CDD, taking into account the local emissions profile for the grid at the time the building is first occupied to convert grid electrical consumption (kWH) into emissions. The Expected Annual Emissions shall include:\n\n    1. Emissions from any permanently installed onsite combustion such as a natural gas boiler to heat the building.\n\n    2. Emissions from grid electricity delivered to the building for operating any permanently installed equipment and lights in the building, including but not limited to HVAC systems, elevators, and light fixtures.\n d. The Expected Annual Emissions calculation shall not include:\n\n    1. Renewable energy systems such as solar PV systems installed prior to occupancy that net meter to the building itself. \n\n    2. Tenant plug loads and tenant installed onsite fossil fuel combustion (e.g. a natural gas appliance).\n\n    3. Backup generators.\n\n    4. Transportation emissions associated with the building operation.\n\n    5. Emissions associated with electric vehicle charging at the building.\n e. Lifetime Expected Emissions. The Lifetime Expected Emissions from the building will be calculated based on a formula approved by CDD, and will include the following:\n\n    1. The expected decline of grid emissions, reaching zero no later than 2050.\n\n    2. Expected emissions reductions under the BEUDO regime.\n\n    3. Any long term contracts to directly purchase 100% renewable energy sourced from the FERC New England region (such as solar or wind generated energy, or biogas) entered into between the building operator and certified (by CDD) providers of 100% renewable energy shall be subtracted from the total. For example, if the developer has signed a contract for 10 years for the total expected grid electrical consumption to come from renewable sources, the first 10 years of grid electrical consumption shall be considered emissions free and would not contribute to the lifetime expected total emissions.\n\n    4. The formula will assume that no grid emissions will be generated by the building past 2050, and that any onsite fossil fuel equipment will also have been replaced by 2050, so that the building emissions will be modeled as a declining schedule reaching zero no later than 2050.\n f. Total Emissions. The Total Emissions expected to be generated by the building will be the sum of the Embodied Emissions and the Lifetime Expected Emissions.\n g. The developer will present a payment schedule for how to zero out the Total Emissions of the building, using a social cost of carbon formula approved by CDD. The payment schedule may be annualized over a period not to exceed 10 years. The outstanding balance shall act as a lien on the property in case it is sold. Any offset must demonstrate direct benefits to low-income and minority communities in Cambridge, including economic opportunity through job creation and or financial savings through e.g. utility bill reductions.\nAcceptable offsets must be approved by CDD, and will include:\n\n    1. No less than 25% of the mitigation funds shall be spent on green jobs development programs, including education and training, to help build capacity for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects in Cambridge. Any such program must be free of cost to participants, and successful completion of the program must lead to a certification in a specific skill such as, for example: Solar Installer, Weatherization Installer and Technician, Building Energy Analyst, Urban Forestry or Urban Agriculture. Specific criteria and certifications will be set by CDD via regulation.\n\n    2. Payment for energy efficiency upgrades to existing buildings located in the City of Cambridge.\n\n    3. Payment into the City of Cambridge Renewable Energy and Greenhouse Gas Reduction Revolving Fund for reducing emission in public projects, including affordable housing developments.\n\n    4. Payment for the installation of new solar PV systems to be located in the City of Cambridge.\n\n    5. Payment for the creation of community solar PV installations that benefit Cambridge residents by making discounted solar generated electricity available to them. Such systems need not be located in Cambridge but must be located in the Northeast Massachusetts and Boston (NEMA) load zone. \n\n    6. Payment for direct supply contracts of 100% renewable electricity from sources within the FERC ISO New England assigned to another building(s) in the City of Cambridge, including via participation in Cambridge\u2019s Community Choice Electricity (CCE) program.",

            "text": "WHEREAS: The climate crisis continues to worsen and disproportionately impacts the most vulnerable members of our community; and\n WHEREAS: To effectively respond to this crisis, we need to completely decarbonize the US economy in the next ten years by enacting a Green New Deal at every level of government; and\n WHEREAS: Cambridge\u2019s extraordinary financial position and status as a global center of innovation represent a mandate for the city to truly lead the way on the most pressing issue of our time; and\n WHEREAS: Cambridge is a true leader on constructing all electric net zero ready and net zero emissions municipal buildings, including the King Open/Cambridge Street Upper School Complex, but the vast majority of the city\u2019s emissions come from commercial buildings, including especially laboratory buildings, which means total emissions have only continued to increase over time as we\u2019ve added many millions of new square feet of commercial development; and\n WHEREAS: All the technological and economic feasibility now exists to build all-electric net zero emissions buildings in Cambridge; and\n WHEREAS: While almost all of our building emissions come from the existing building stock, decarbonizing existing buildings is expensive and difficult,\nso we need to mandate net zero new construction as soon as possible; and\n WHEREAS: On December 11, 2019, the Ordinance Committee of the Cambridge City Council voted to refer a proposed ordinance banning natural gas combustion in new buildings to the full City Council with a favorable recommendation; and\n WHEREAS: Attorney General Maura Healey struck down Brookline\u2019s proposed bylaw to ban natural gas hookups in new construction via the building code, making it legally challenging for Cambridge to adopt the proposed ordinance without a home rule petition; and\n WHEREAS: The Cambridge Green New Deal Zoning Petition (attached) would provide a framework for accepting local emissions offsets to strengthen green jobs programs and energy efficiency upgrades to the existing building stock,\ncreating economic opportunity for our most vulnerable residents who are too often left behind; and\n WHEREAS: The Cambridge Green New Deal Zoning Petition would exempt all new housing construction, which is not a significant driver of emissions, while creating opportunities to improve energy efficiency and renewable energy deployment in the existing housing stock; and\n WHEREAS: The Cambridge City Council is committed to rapid decarbonization in a way that creates economic opportunity and climate justice for our most vulnerable residents; now therefore be it\n ORDERED: That the City Council amend the Article 22 of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Cambridge entitled \u201cSUSTAINABLE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT\u201d to insert a new section 22.24.4 to read as follows:\n 22.24.4 Emissions Accounting.\n The provisions in this section shall not apply to any residential buildings that include affordable units.\n a. Embodied Emissions: As a condition of receiving an occupancy permit, the developer shall provide to CDD an accounting of the emissions generated by the construction of any Green Building Project. The Embodied Emissions shall be documented by a licensed engineer, using Passive House or other acceptable energy and emissions modeling software, and include:\n\n    1. Emissions for manufacturing all building materials used, including associated raw materials extraction, production and transportation.\n\n    2. Estimates for transportation emissions caused by delivering the materials to the construction site.\n\n    3. Emissions generated on the site by heavy equipment such as cranes.\n b. The Embodied Emissions shall not include:\n\n    1. Emissions associated with installing renewable energy facilities on site, including but not limited to solar PV and solar hot water, air source and ground source heat pumps, and any other systems that substantially reduce the future emissions of the building.\n\n    2. Emissions generated from human labor (e.g. individual transport, small power tools, food consumption, etc.).\n\n    3. Emissions for transporting landscaping materials and plants to the site.\n\n    4. Emissions associated with installing electric vehicle charging infrastructure (EVSE).\n c. Expected Annual Emissions. The developer shall present an accounting of the expected emissions to be generated by routine operation of the building over the course of one calendar year. Emissions will be calculated as metric tons of CO2 equivalent using a formula approved by CDD, taking into account the local emissions profile for the grid at the time the building is first occupied to convert grid electrical consumption (kWH) into emissions. The Expected Annual Emissions shall include:\n\n    1. Emissions from any permanently installed onsite combustion such as a natural gas boiler to heat the building.\n\n    2. Emissions from grid electricity delivered to the building for operating any permanently installed equipment and lights in the building, including but not limited to HVAC systems, elevators, and light fixtures.\n d. The Expected Annual Emissions calculation shall not include:\n\n    1. Renewable energy systems such as solar PV systems installed prior to occupancy that net meter to the building itself. \n\n    2. Tenant plug loads and tenant installed onsite fossil fuel combustion (e.g. a natural gas appliance).\n\n    3. Backup generators.\n\n    4. Transportation emissions associated with the building operation.\n\n    5. Emissions associated with electric vehicle charging at the building.\n e. Lifetime Expected Emissions. The Lifetime Expected Emissions from the building will be calculated based on a formula approved by CDD, and will include the following:\n\n    1. The expected decline of grid emissions, reaching zero no later than 2050.\n\n    2. Expected emissions reductions under the BEUDO regime.\n\n    3. Any long term contracts to directly purchase 100% renewable energy sourced from the FERC New England region (such as solar or wind generated energy, or biogas) entered into between the building operator and certified (by CDD) providers of 100% renewable energy shall be subtracted from the total. For example, if the developer has signed a contract for 10 years for the total expected grid electrical consumption to come from renewable sources, the first 10 years of grid electrical consumption shall be considered emissions free and would not contribute to the lifetime expected total emissions.\n\n    4. The formula will assume that no grid emissions will be generated by the building past 2050, and that any onsite fossil fuel equipment will also have been replaced by 2050, so that the building emissions will be modeled as a declining schedule reaching zero no later than 2050.\n f. Total Emissions. The Total Emissions expected to be generated by the building will be the sum of the Embodied Emissions and the Lifetime Expected Emissions.\n g. The developer will present a payment schedule for how to zero out the Total Emissions of the building, using a social cost of carbon formula approved by CDD. The payment schedule may be annualized over a period not to exceed 10 years. The outstanding balance shall act as a lien on the property in case it is sold. Any offset must demonstrate direct benefits to low-income and minority communities in Cambridge, including economic opportunity through job creation and or financial savings through e.g. utility bill reductions.\nAcceptable offsets must be approved by CDD, and will include:\n\n    1. No less than 25% of the mitigation funds shall be spent on green jobs development programs, including education and training, to help build capacity for energy efficiency and renewable energy projects in Cambridge. Any such program must be free of cost to participants, and successful completion of the program must lead to a certification in a specific skill such as, for example: Solar Installer, Weatherization Installer and Technician, Building Energy Analyst, Urban Forestry or Urban Agriculture. Specific criteria and certifications will be set by CDD via regulation.\n\n    2. Payment for energy efficiency upgrades to existing buildings located in the City of Cambridge.\n\n    3. Payment into the City of Cambridge Renewable Energy and Greenhouse Gas Reduction Revolving Fund for reducing emission in public projects, including affordable housing developments.\n\n    4. Payment for the installation of new solar PV systems to be located in the City of Cambridge.\n\n    5. Payment for the creation of community solar PV installations that benefit Cambridge residents by making discounted solar generated electricity available to them. Such systems need not be located in Cambridge but must be located in the Northeast Massachusetts and Boston (NEMA) load zone. \n\n    6. Payment for direct supply contracts of 100% renewable electricity from sources within the FERC ISO New England assigned to another building(s) in the City of Cambridge, including via participation in Cambridge\u2019s Community Choice Electricity (CCE) program.",

Cannabis Uses that are delivery-only and not permitted to operate a retail storefront should occupy minimal ground-story frontage along major retail streets and are encouraged to collocate with active uses to preserve a vibrant streetscape. Where interior activities must be screened from public view or where there is no access by customers, such areas should be screened by transparent, publicly accessible active business uses where possible. Opaque fa\u00e7ades should be minimized, and where they are necessary they should include changing public art displays or other measures to provide visual interest to the public.\n\n(e)  If the proposed Cannabis Retail Store or Cannabis Production Facility is not proposed to include a Medical Marijuana Treatment Center, it will nevertheless provide programs to assist qualifying patients within the city or neighborhood who are registered through the Massachusetts Medical Use of Marijuana Program in obtaining services under that program.\n Delete Section 11.806, which currently reads as follows:\n 11.806  Effective Date.

Cambridge Racial Justice and Equity Commission\n Executive Summary\n The Commission will examine all aspects of government, society, economy and environment in light of historic, systemic, and ongoing racial injustice and inequity in our city. Within the first year the commission will report on at least the following:\n\n  \n 1. Implementation of policy order [2021 #141](http://cambridgema.iqm2.com/Citizens/Detail_LegiFile.aspx?Frame=&MeetingID=2894&MediaPosition=&ID=14332&CssClass=) calling for a percentage of revenue from local cannabis sales, as well as applying funding from other sources, towards reparations for slavery, and implementation of policy order [2021 #166](http://cambridgema.iqm2.com/Citizens/Detail_LegiFile.aspx?Frame=&MeetingID=2894&MediaPosition=&ID=14496&CssClass=) calling for a percentage of revenue from local cannabis sales to be applied towards restitution for the war on drugs, and redress for other racially unjust policies.\n 2. Proposals for immediate changes to any aspects of city government that would likely lead to improved racial justice and equity outcomes, based on research and data, including but not limited to housing, education, economic opportunity, healthcare, mental health, crisis response, and environmental justice.\n 3. Identify future areas of work, including but not limited to: additional sources of revenues for reparations for slavery and land theft, additional acknowledgments of harm and apologies for past and ongoing transgression, names (of buildings, streets, neighborhoods, schools), climate change impacts and any other aspects of life that can and should be addresses from a racial justice and equity lens.\n The Commission will also track and respond to state and federal efforts, such as H.R. 40, which was recently\n[moved](https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2021-04-14/slavery-reparations-\nbill-moves-forward-in-congress) out of the House Judiciary Committee in Congress.\n Structure\n The commission shall at its inception have not less than one full-time staff person hired by the city. The commission shall further have appointed commissioners who represent different areas of knowledge, including but not limited to:  \n\n\u00b7 Economic Opportunity\n\n\u00b7 Housing\n\n\u00b7 Education\n\n\u00b7 Public Safety/Policing\n\n\u00b7 Mental Health\n\n\u00b7 Public Health\n\n\u00b7 Medicine\n\n\u00b7 Urban Agriculture\n\n\u00b7 Recreation\n\n\u00b7 Finance\n\n\u00b7 Environmental Justice\n\n\u00b7 Climate Change Impacts\n\n\u00b7 Transit Equity\n The commission shall pay a stipend of $100/hour for regular meeting attendance to all Commissioners. Any work done in addition to meeting attendance shall be compensated through a contract with the city.\n Commissioners will serve for 1-year terms, with no more than 2 consecutive terms served.\n A majority of the Commissioners shall be women or non-male identifying, and a majority of the Commissioners shall be people who identify as Black, with the remainder having a balance of representatives of other marginalized communities, including Asian, Native American, Hispanic.\n The majority of Commissioners shall be current or former Cambridge residents.\nRelevant city departments will select representatives to coordinate with the commission, but city staff shall not be commissioners.\n Timeline and Implementation\n The commission shall be seated in the fall of 2021 and begin regular meetings.\nStaff will be hired as soon as possible, and the first order of business shall be taken up regarding cannabis revenues and a comprehensive audit of racism embedded in our laws, policies, departments and structures of government and the economy.\n History and Motivation\n Racial injustice in the U.S. goes back not just to the founding of the United States but to the very beginnings of colonization of the American landmass by European people, beginning with the subjugation and displacement of Indigenous People, and continuing with the abduction of African People as slaves, and the mistreatment of Asian immigrants and others denied access to full participation in American society.\n While modern American society has abolished chatel slavery and outlawed some forms of overt racism, people of African, Indigenous and non-European descent continue to be harmed by racist policies and ideas that perpetuate and amplify both historical and new inequities.\n By establishing this commission and fully acknowledging the magnitude of harm that is being done, we create opportunities to systemically and radically eradicate racist policies and ideas from our lives and from our future.\n Education and Awareness\n Because racism is active literally everywhere in our society, it can seem daunting and overwhelming and even intractable. However, the only true limit to what we can accomplish is the depth of our commitment to accomplishing it.\nWhile we cannot eradicate racism and inequality everywhere all at once, we can identify specific aspects of racism and inequality to attack and continue to collect and focus resources on different areas of our society and government,\nimproving the lives of people who have for too long been ignored, marginalized and oppressed.\n To that end the commission will seek to educate the government and the people of Cambridge on these issues of racial justice and equity, empowering more and more people to take right action in order to reduce harm, using both formal and informal means of education.\n Resources and Growth\n The commission is neither the beginning nor the end of our reckoning with racism and inequality. There are many ongoing efforts in our city that the commission can strengthen and drive resources towards, and there are many areas of effort that will require their own organizational structures, funding and staffing to succeed. The commission's purpose is to identify these areas and steer resources towards them, not to solve every problem it sees by itself. The intent is to put the full power and resources of the government behind these efforts to maximize success and produce ongoing positive outcomes.\n As these efforts succeed, they will empower more and more people and organizations to make change, until anti-racism and equity work become as routine and thorough as food production or electricity generation: a normal part of what we do every day to nurture and sustain our civilization.",

            "text": "WHEREAS: The Cambridge City Council hereby finds and determines that wage theft in all its various forms, including the illegal misclassification of employees as independent contractors, has become an epidemic particularly in the construction industry; and  \n  \n   WHEREAS: The Cambridge City Council hereby further finds and determines that the problem is so pervasive that traditional law enforcement agencies lack the resources to address it effectively, and that, as a result, municipalities have the civic responsibility to do whatever is within their power and authority to prevent such illegal practices from taking place on their own construction projects, on projects receiving building permits from the municipality, and on projects receiving municipal tax relief; and   WHEREAS: The Cambridge City Council hereby further finds and determines that wage theft is often accompanied by employer tax and insurance fraud, with employers failing to pay their payroll taxes and workers compensation premiums, and that it will not tolerate spending tax dollars or providing tax relief for construction projects being built by contractors engaging in tax fraud; and   WHEREAS: The Cambridge City Council hereby further finds and determines that, in any event, taxpayer money is most efficiently and productively spent by awarding construction contracts to, and providing tax relief for construction projects built by, reputable, honest, law-abiding firms that include and enforce provisions requiring, with respect to their own employees and those of subcontractors at all tiers, compliance with state laws governing the payment of prevailing wages and other wage and hour laws, the provision of workers compensation coverage, and the proper classification of individuals as employees and not as independent contractors, as well as state law concerning health insurance coverage; and   WHEREAS: The Cambridge City Council hereby further finds and determines that, due to the pervasiveness of wage theft in the construction industry, significant financial incentives are necessary to motivate property owners and their general contractors to take steps sufficient to ensure that wage theft does not occur on their projects; and   WHEREAS: The Cambridge City Council hereby further notes that based on a 2015\n[study](https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/one-time-pubs/color-of-\nwealth.aspx) and as reported by a recent Cambridge Community Foundation\n[report](https://cambridgecf.org/ei-report/) significant economic disparities exist in the Boston Metro area, including Cambridge, that disproportionately disadvantage Black and Brown people; and   WHEREAS: The Cambridge City Council hereby further finds and determines that, based on these and other studies and reports, and based on the high level of lack of economic opportunity for Black and Brown community members, the residents of the City of Cambridge should be part of and benefit from public construction projects and projects receiving municipal permits and that, accordingly, it is appropriate to require that such projects include employment opportunities for Cambridge residents, especially Black and Brown people, women, and veterans;\nnow therefore be it   ORDERED: That the City Council schedule a hearing of the Ordinance Committee for the purposes of amending the Ordinance of the City of Cambridge to insert the language below:  \n  \n2.66.090 MUNICIPAL BUILDING PERMITS\n A. Minimum Mandatory Conditions.

The contractor has not been debarred or suspended from performing construction work by any federal, state or local government agency or authority in the past five years;\n 2.

The contractor must maintain appropriate industrial accident insurance sufficient to provide coverage for all the employees on the project in accordance with G.L. c.152 and provide documentary proof of such coverage to the Inspectional Services Department to be maintained as a public record;\n 4. The contractor must properly classify employees as employees rather than independent contractors and treat them accordingly for purposes of minimum wages and overtime, workers\u2019 compensation insurance coverage, unemployment taxes, social security taxes and state and federal income tax withholding, in accordance with G.L. c.149, \u00a7148B on employee classification and any other relevant statutes, laws and ordinances;\n 5. The contractor must comply with G.L. c. 151, \u00a71A and G.L. c. 149, \u00a7 148 and any other relevant statutes, laws and ordinances with respect to the payment of wages; and   \n 6.

Once the City Manager or designee determines that the violation has been remedied, the City Manager or designee shall withdraw the stop work order and construction on the project may proceed.\n C.

            "text": "WHEREAS: Abortion care is essential health care and health care is a fundamental human right; and  \n  \n   WHEREAS: Equal access to abortion care everywhere is essential to social and economic participation, reproductive autonomy, and the right to determine ones future;\nand   WHEREAS: Equitable access to comprehensive reproductive health care\u2014including abortion care is fundamentally a racial and economic justice issue; and   WHEREAS: The landmark Supreme Court ruling Roe v. Wade upholds the constitutional right to privacy, including in health care decisions and the right to access abortion care; and   WHEREAS: The rights established in Roe v. Wade have been relied upon in this country for nearly 50 years with nearly 7 in 10 Americans agree with the decision that established a woman\u2019s right to an abortion; and   WHEREAS: In 2020, the ROE Act was passed into law in the Commonwealth, abolishing unnecessary abortion restrictions and codifying the principles of reproductive freedom in Massachusetts state law; and   WHEREAS: Over the last decade reproductive rights and freedom have been under attack across the nation and since 2011, anti-abortion lawmakers throughout the country have pushed nearly 500 restrictive laws through state legislatures to make abortion difficult and at times completely impossible to access; and   WHEREAS: These abortion bans and restrictions have become more extreme and have aimed to restrict abortion as early as 6 and 8 weeks of pregnancy\u2014before many people even know they are pregnant; and   WHEREAS: Abortion bans do not stop abortion, they merely push safe, necessary care out of reach of the most vulnerable and disproportionately impact Black,\nIndigenous, and People of Color and those struggling to make ends meet; and   WHEREAS: On September 1, 2021 the Supreme Court denied an emergency request to block Texas S.B. 8, a blatantly unconstitutional and radical six-week abortion ban that also incentivizes vigilantism and provides a $10,000 reward for private citizens who sue their neighbors on suspicion of abetting abortion; and   WHEREAS: The Texas SB 8 bill will not be the last attack on reproductive freedom; this fall, the Supreme Court is scheduled to consider another case from Mississippi that takes direct aim at the core protections of Roe v. Wade; and   WHEREAS: It is clear that the ultraconservative majority on the Supreme Court is not interested in defending abortion rights and access from these constant attacks and has now helped to advance the agenda to end access to safe abortion; and   WHEREAS: Congress can and must act to pass legislation that affirms reproductive rights, freedom and justice and codifies protections in Roe v. Wade in federal law once and for all; and   WHEREAS: The Women\u2019s Health Protection Act, co-introduced by Massachusetts\u2019s own Representative Ayanna Pressley along with Representative Judy Chu is the legislative solution that would fight back against these ultraconservative attacks on abortion access and codify the right for doctors to provide and patients to access abortion care free from medically unnecessary bans and restrictions; and   WHEREAS: Each day that goes by without Congressional action means that more people\u2014disproportionately Black, Indigenous, and People of Color, members of the LGBTQIA+ community and those struggling to make ends meet-- will be denied their constitutional right to abortion; now therefore be it   RESOLVED: That the City Council go on record in support of Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley\u2019s Women\u2019s Health Protection Act as the legislative solution to fight back against the calculated attacks on reproductive rights and freedom across the country; and be it further   RESOLVED: That the City Council urges President Biden to swiftly sign the Women\u2019s Health Protection Act into law and continue to use the full power of the Presidency to affirm reproductive rights and justice for all; and be it further   RESOLVED: That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a copy of this resolution to the Cambridge delegation and President Biden on behalf of the entire City Council.",

            "text": "WHEREAS: The City of Cambridge has demonstrated commitment to providing high quality,\naffordable housing for residents; and  \n  \n   WHEREAS: The City Council has urged the city to consider any available properties and explore opportunities to purchase properties that might be used for affordable housing, and to explore using city-owned sites including parking lots for such uses, with recent examples being a request to consider Lesley University\u2019s recent offerings and the Lowell St. parking lot; Of affordable housing units available, 1 percent are available for homeownership and the rest for rentals;\nand   WHEREAS: The City Council is also on record as asking that more affordable housing units the city develops should include home ownership opportunities, which are a necessity to ensure that all residents have the opportunity to build wealth and have a place to call their own; and   WHEREAS: Multi-family properties that would make excellent candidates for homeownership opportunity have come onto the market recently -- for example, a [property\n](https://www.redfin.com/MA/Cambridge/97-Hancock-\nSt-02139/unit-1/home/11565609)on Hancock Street, 22 units for $13.5 million,\nand a [property ](https://www.compass.com/listing/38-gibson-street-cambridge-\nma-02138/918893633076105001/)on Gibson Street, that is already under contract was listed as $10 million for 18 units in a desirable part of Cambridge close to transit; and   WHEREAS: The per unit price in the listing prices of these two examples of about\n$500K/unit is below many recent affordable housing projects which have averaged about $600K/unit and been as high as $900K/unit; and   WHEREAS: If purchased by the City, these properties would expand access to affordable housing, and likely homeownership for residents; now therefore be it   ORDERED: That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to confer with the appropriate City departments to ensure multi-family properties on the market are reviewed as quickly as possible as potential affordable housing acquisitions; and be it further   ORDERED: That the City Manager report back to the City Council in a timely manner.",

            "text": "AN ORDINANCE PROVIDING PROTECTION FOR TENANTS FACING DISPLACEMENT BY CONDOMINIUM COOPERATIVE CONVERSION PURSUANT TO CITY'S AUTHORITY UNDER ST.\n1983, C. 527\n WHEREAS, in 1983, the State Legislature adopted Chapters 527 of the Acts of 1983, in which the General Court found and declared that a serious emergency exists within the Commonwealth with respect to the housing of a substantial number of the citizens of the Commonwealth. This rental housing emergency created by prolonged increases in housing costs at a rate substantially exceeding increases in personal income, by housing abandonment, and by increased costs of new housing construction and finance has been greatly exacerbated by the effect of conversion of rental housing into condominiums or cooperatives. Currently the combination of a booming housing market with extraordinarily high rental prices and an extremely low vacancy rate makes it extremely difficult for many tenants, including elders, low and moderate income tenants, and tenants with disabilities, to relocate. In order to adequately protect these tenants facing displacement as a result of condominium conversion, they must receive further protection from the consequence of such conversion than the law now affords. The current housing crisis and the threat of displacement as a result of condominium conversion poses a serious threat to the public health, safety, and general welfare of the: citizens of the Commonwealth, particularly the elderly, the handicapped,\nand persons and families of low and moderate income. It is therefore necessary-that such emergency be dealt with immediately; and\n WHEREAS, Section 2 of Chapter 527 of the Acts of l93 provides that any city or town may, by ordinance or by-law, impose provisions or requirements to regulate for the protection of tenants with respect to the conversion of housing accommodations, as defined therein, to the condominium or cooperative forms of ownership and evictions related thereto which differ from those set forth in Chapter 527, upon a two-thirds vote of the City Council with the approval of the Mayor, and\n WHEREAS, Section 2 of Chapter 527 of the Acts of 1983 also provides that local legislative action to impose provisions or requirements to regulate for the protection of tenants with respect to the conversion of housing accommodations to the condominium or cooperative forms of ownership and evictions related thereto which differ from those set forth in Chapter 527 must be accompanied by a declaration, in the form of findings, that local conditions constitute an acute rental housing emergency requiring local action, on account of the aggravating impact of the facts set forth in Section 1 of Chapter 527; and\n WHEREAS, prior and subsequent to Chapter 527 of the Acts of 1983, following declarations of emergency by the City Council and the State legislature; the City of Cambridge adopted ordinances for the protection of tenants with respect to the conversion of housing accommodations to the condominium or cooperative forms of ownership and evictions related thereto pursuant to the authority granted to it under its rent and eviction control enabling laws,\nincluding Chapter 36 of the Acts of 1976, extending such protections to rent-\ncontrolled accommodations; and -\n WHEREAS, during the 1970's over one thousand nine hundred units of rental housing in the City of Cambridge were removed from the rental market due to conversion to the condominium or cooperative form of ownership; and\n WHEREAS, in August 1979 the City of Cambridge enacted Section 8.44 of the Cambridge\n Municipal Code which regulated eviction due to condominium conversion; and\n WHEREAS, as a result of the City's regulation of condominium or cooperative conversion, tenant displacement by reason of condominium or cooperative conversation eviction substantially abated; and\n WHEREAS, Chapter 282 of the Acts of 1994 provided that rent and eviction protections should continue in effect for certain low-income tenants in rent-\ncontrolled units until December 31, 1996; and\n WHEREAS, Section 3 of Chapter 282 of the Acts of 1994 provides that cities or towns in which rent control authority ended retain their rights under Chapter 527 of the Acts of 1983, to enact local ordinances to provide tenant protections regarding condominium or cooperative conversions and evictions resulting therefrom which may be different from the protections found in Chapter 527 of the Acts of 1983; and\n WHEREAS; with the adoption of Chapter 282 of the Acts of 1994 and M.G.L. e.\n40P eviction protections ended under rent control enabling laws; and\n WHEREAS, there continues to be a high rate of conversion of rental unite to the condominium form of ownership and a sharp escalation in the cost of both rental housing and housing for purchase in the City of Cambridge;

and   WHEREAS: Wage theft disproportionately impacts people of color and undocumented immigrants who already face significant economic disparities in\n[Cambridge](https://cambridgecf.org/ei-report/) and\n[regionally](https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/one-time-pubs/color-of-\nwealth.aspx);

and   WHEREAS: The City Council is resolved to ensure that wage theft is prevented by ensuring that all employers including subcontractors comply with state laws governing the payment of prevailing wages and other wage and hour laws, the provision of workers compensation coverage, the proper classification of individuals as employees versus independent contractors, as well as state law concerning health insurance coverage; and   WHEREAS: Establishing a Wage Theft Complaint Process, a representative Wage Theft Enforcement Committee, and a required annual report will improve enforcement of wage theft across a wide range of industries, enhance communication with the Attorney General\u2019s Office, and ensure transparency and accountability;

The requirements of this section shall not apply to health care uses that require licensure or certification as a healthcare facility by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.\n f. The requirements of this section shall not apply to repairs or replacement of any existing portions of a fuel piping system deemed unsafe or dangerous by the Plumbing and Gas Fitting Inspector.\n g. The requirements of this section shall not apply to any required back-up emergency system.\n h. The requirements of this section shall not apply to any application for a special permit, made pursuant to the Design Review requirements of section 5.09, if no other special permit is otherwise required.\n i. The requirements of this section shall not apply to any application for a special permit for the renovation, reconstruction, alteration or extension of a nonconforming single or two-family residence, where the only relief needed represents an increase or intensification of a nonconformity lawfully in existence at the time the applicable provision of the Zoning Ordinance became effective.\n 4. Climate Responsive Conditions for Approval of Special Permits\n Except as otherwise provided in this section, the Planning Board or Board of Zoning Appeal shall not approve any special permit application made pursuant to section 10.40 unless the Board finds that:\n a. The proposal does not involve the installation of any new On-Site Fossil Fuel Infrastructure or the continuation of any On-Site Fossil Fuel Infrastructure installed pursuant to a special permit previously issued subject to this section; or\n b. The proposal involves the installation of On-Site Fossil Fuel Infrastructure or the continuation of any On-Site Fossil Fuel Infrastructure installed pursuant to a special permit previously issued subject to this section; provided, however, that either:\n 1. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph 4, subparagraph b(2) of this section, the special permit shall be conditionally approved for a term not to exceed five years from the date of its first exercise or until January 1, 2030, whichever is later; or\n 2. Where a special permit has previously been issued subject to paragraph 4, subparagraph b(1) of this section, it may, for good cause, be renewed, one or more times, for a term not to exceed one year; or\n 5. Waivers\n A waiver from the requirements of paragraph 4 of this section may be approved by the Planning Board or Board of Zoning Appeal, in its special permit decision, upon a finding:\n a. If supported by a detailed cost comparison provided by the applicant, that strict compliance with the requirements of paragraph 4 would be financially infeasible, including after utilizing available rebates and credits, or otherwise impractical to implement; or\n b. That strict compliance with the requirements of paragraph 4 would result in the loss of new affordable housing units eligible for inclusion in the Department of Housing and Community Development Chapter 40B Subsidized Housing Inventory.\n No modification of a special permit, the rights under which have previously been exercised, shall grant a waiver from the requirements of this section. In considering any waiver request, the Planning Board or Board of Zoning Appeal shall evaluate whether particular portions of a project are financially infeasible or impractical to implement, or would result in the loss of new affordable housing units, and the Board shall issue waivers narrowly for those portions, where appropriate, rather than for an entire project.\n 6. Notices\n For a special permit granted subject to paragraph 4, subparagraph b of this section, any notice that is required to be recorded pursuant to M.G.L. c.40A,\n\u00a711, shall include a statement detailing the condition upon which the special permit was granted.\n For all properties subject to a special permit conditioned on a time limitation pursuant to paragraph 4, subparagraph b(1) of this section, the City Manager or designee will provide notice to the owner of record of the expiration of said special permit and the requirement of compliance with this section. Such notice will be first provided not less than three (3) years prior to the expiration of such a special permit, and annually thereafter;\nprovided, however, that the failure of the City Manager or designee to issue timely notices pursuant to this paragraph shall not be deemed to prevent the Building Commissioner from seeking to enforce the requirements of this section or otherwise to operate as a defense to any such enforcement action.\n 7. Rules, Regulations, and Guidelines\n No later than 3 months after the adoption of this amendment, the Planning Board or Board of Zoning Appeals shall adopt, and may in its discretion thereafter amend, guidelines for procedures and waivers that will provide for the uniform and equitable application of this section. The Planning Board or Board of Zoning Appeal may consider such guidelines in making special permit decisions subject to this section.",

The Embodied Emissions shall be documented by a licensed engineer, using Passive House or other acceptable energy and emissions modeling software, and include:\n 1) Emissions for manufacturing all building materials used, including associated raw materials extraction, production and transportation, including all concrete, steel, aluminum and glass.\n 2) Estimates for transportation emissions caused by delivering the materials to the construction site.\n 3) Emissions generated on the site by heavy equipment such as cranes.\n The Embodied Emissions shall not include:\n 1) Emissions associated with installing renewable energy facilities on site,\nincluding but not limited to solar PV and solar hot water, air source and ground source heat pumps, and any other systems that substantially reduce the future emissions of the building.\n 2) Emissions generated from human labor (e.g. individual transport, small power tools, food consumption, etc.).\n 3) Emissions for transporting landscaping materials and plants to the site.\n 4) Emissions associated with installing electric vehicle supply equipment\n(EVSE).\n b) Expected Annual Emissions. The developer shall present an accounting of the expected emissions to be generated by routine operation of the building over the course of each calendar year. Emissions will be calculated as metric tons of CO2 equivalent using the estimated EUI (source and site EUI) for the building, taking into account the anticipated local emissions profile for the grid (ISO New England adjusted by the Massachusetts Renewable Energy Portfolio Standard (RPS)) (source EUI) for each year to convert grid electrical consumption (kWH) into emissions. The estimated EUI for the building shall include:\n 1) Expected onsite combustion such as a natural gas boiler to heat the building for the expected lifetime of such equipment.\n 2) Grid electricity for operating anticipated equipment and lights in the building, including but not limited to HVAC systems, elevators, and light fixtures.\n 3) Tenant/occupant plug loads and other tenant/occupant contributions to EUI\n(site and source) that can reasonably be estimated.\n The estimated EUI for the building may be calculated by subtracting from the total estimated energy consumption any energy produced by onsite renewable energy systems such as solar PV systems planned to be installed prior to occupancy that net meter to the building itself.\n The Expected Annual Emissions calculation shall not include:\n 1) Tenant plug loads and tenant installed onsite fossil fuel combustion (e.g.\na natural gas appliance) that cannot be reasonably anticipated.\n 2) Backup generators.\n 3) Transportation emissions associated with the building operation.\n 4) Emissions associated with electric vehicle charging at the building.\n c) Lifetime Expected Emissions. The Lifetime Expected Emissions from the building will be calculated as the sum of the Expected Annual Emissions from the year of first occupancy until 2050.\n d) Total Emissions. The Total Emissions expected to be generated by the building will be the sum of the Embodied Emissions and the Lifetime Expected Emissions.\n e) Reporting Standards. All emissions and energy use (EUI) reporting shall follow the standards specified in Chapter 8.67 of the Municipal Code\n(\u201cBuilding Energy Use\u201d) and associated regulations, and shall be reported in Metric Tons of Carbon Dioxide Equivalents (MTCO2e) for emissions and British Thermal Unit (BTU) per square foot per year for EUI.

            "text": "WHEREAS: At least seven Economic Empowerment (EE) and Social\n Equity (SE) applicants in Cambridge have so far\n received their business permits, and Cambridge is\n poised to soon have one of the highest concentrations\n of equity adult use cannabis retail establishments in the\n state, yet to date, only one business has been able to open their doors; and  \n  \n   WHEREAS: A variety of factors have contributed to the slow start of establishing local\n recreational dispensaries, including but not limited to procedural delays\n caused by the pandemic, litigation, and the significant costs associated with\n obtaining licenses, securing product, securing and holding retail space during\n an international pandemic, and the hiring and training of staff; and   WHEREAS: The two-year delay caused by the Covid-19 pandemic has presented a particularly difficult challenge for local Equity Empowerment (the \u201cEE\u201d) and Social Equity (the \u201cSE\u201d) applicants to navigate, as those who secured retail space two or more years ago in anticipation of offsetting their monthly rent with their monthly profits have instead had to absorb two years\u2019 worth of rent without any sales to offset these costs, threatening the fiscal viability of some these fledgling enterprises; and   WHEREAS: Cambridge\u2019s pioneering exclusivity period has built a\n strong foundation for equitable development of the\n emerging adult-use cannabis industry, but it is\n imperative to consider additional ways to assist EE and\n SE applicants through the immense challenges they\n face; and   WHEREAS: Another significant cost will be the local \u201cImpact Fees,\u201d which the City defines in all its HCAs as \u201c\u2026the amount of three percent (3%) of the Applicant\u2019s gross revenues derived from the Cannabis Business\u2019 sales\u2026[because]\u2026[t]he Parties anticipate that, as a result of the Applicant\u2019s operation of the Cannabis Business, the City will incur additional expenses and impacts upon its road system, law enforcement, inspectional services,\npermitting services, administrative services, educational services and public health services, in addition to potential unforeseen impacts upon the City,\u201d and these fees must be paid to the City on an annual basis; and   WHEREAS: Massachusetts has collected $74.2 million from cannabis sales as of December\n 2021, the excise tax of 10.75% on recreational cannabis comprising less than\n half of the total tax revenue being collected for cannabis, as there is also a\n 6.25% state sales tax, plus the local tax of 3% and the Impact Fees\n of up to 3% of gross revenue, which all added up to $208 million in total tax\n revenue last fiscal year; and   WHEREAS: Due to substantial and negative impact of the 3% local tax (Impact Fees) on the viability of these EE and SE Cannabis Dispensaries, and in light of the supporting evidence from [other Massachusetts municipalities that the removal of these Impact Fees would not have any appreciable impacts upon the community or add significant additional costs to the City](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/city-of-northampton-nixes-3-impact-\nfee-2357694/#:~:text=City%20of%20Northampton%20Nixes%203%25%20Impact%20Fee%20in%20Host%20Community%20Agreements,-Jared%20Kadich&text=Massachusetts%20law%20allows%20communities%20to,with%20hosting%20a%20cannabis%20business),\nit would be a small but significant action if the City were to remove or reduce this additional financial hurdle for local EE and SE applicants, in an effort to support the viability of these businesses during such uncertain times for brick and mortar businesses; and   WHEREAS: The City Council has repeatedly declared its strong support for creating\n favorable conditions that would provide EE and SE applicants with the\n greatest chances for success, and to that end it would be just and equitable for\n the City to conditionally waive impact fees for all Cannabis Businesses\n until and unless the city is required to expend funds to mitigate specific\n impacts from Cannabis Businesses, and to exempt EE and SE applicants\n from any such charges to the maximum extent permissible ; now\n therefore be it   ORDERED: That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to amend all existing Community Host Agreements previously issued by the City by reducing the Impact Fee to 0.05% of Gross Revenue and to refrain from placing this burden upon any future HCAs that may yet be issued, unless supporting evidence is provided by the City showing a finding that it incurred additional expenses and impacts upon its road system, law enforcement, inspectional services, permitting services, administrative services, educational services and public health services greater than the .05% of Gross Revenue collected from all the EE and SE dispensaries annually; and be it further   ORDERED: That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to work with relevant staff\n to provide a comprehensive, data-driven update on Cambridge\u2019s emerging\n cannabis industry at a future hearing of the Finance Committee, including (but\n not limited to):\n\n\u00b7 Information on the number of EE and SE applicants seeking to open in Cambridge and where they stand in the process\n\n\u00b7 Information on the ways in which city staff have worked with EE and SE applicants to help them get through the process as swiftly as possible\n\n\u00b7 Information on revenue generated by adult-use cannabis businesses in Cambridge to date\n\n\u00b7 A legal opinion on the possibility of completely exempting EE and SE\n applicants from impact fees that may be assessed, or to charge them\n proportionally less than other applicants, as a matter of equity\n\n\u00b7 An itemization from the City Manager listing all the fees imposed\n upon EE and SE applicants from the issuing of the special permit to the\n issuing of the Certificate of Occupancy\n\n\u00b7 An accounting of the approximate amount of time, on average, it takes an applicant to progress from expressing an interest in opening their business in the City to being issued the Certificate of Occupancy; and be it further   ORDERED: That the City Manager be and hereby is requested to provide this update to the\n Finance Committee shortly after the FY23 budget is adopted by the City\n Council.",

At a minimum, this narrative shall include the following information:  \n 1. Anticipated building envelope performance, including roof, foundation, walls and window assemblies, and window-to-wall ratio;  \n 2. Anticipated energy loads, baseline energy simulation tool assumptions, and proposed energy targets, expressed in terms of site energy use intensity (\"EUI\"), source EUI (expressed as British Thermal Unit (BTU) per square foot per year), and annual greenhouse gas emissions projected until 2050, expressed as Metric Tons of Carbon Dioxide Equivalents (MTCO2e), and calculated in accordance with the standards and requirements established in Chapter 8.67 of the Municipal Code (\u201cBuilding Energy Use\u201d) and associated regulations. If anticipated tenant plug loads (EUI and emissions) are provided, they shall be separately broken out and clearly identified as such;  \n 3. A description of ways in which building energy performance has been integrated into aspects of the Green Building Project's planning, design, and engineering, including building use(s), orientation, massing, envelope systems, building mechanical systems, on-site and off-site renewable energy systems, and district- wide energy systems;  \n 4. A description of the technical framework by which the Green Building Project can be transitioned to net zero emissions prior to 2050 (acknowledging that such a transition might not be economically feasible at first), including future net zero emissions options for building envelope, HVAC systems, domestic hot water, interior lighting, and on- and off-site renewable energy sources;  \n 5. A description of programs provided by local utility companies, government agencies, and other organizations that provide technical assistance, rebates, grants, and incentives that can assist in achieving higher levels of building performance, summarizing which entities have been contacted and which programs could be utilized in the Green Building Project; and  \n\n  6. An assessment of the technical and financial feasibility to meet the projected HVAC and domestic hot water demands of the building (as set forth in Paragraph (2) above) using energy systems that do not consume carbon-based fuels on-site (to include solar photovoltaics and hot water, ground source, water source or air source heat pumps, district energy, geothermal systems, and/or similar systems) compared to code-compliant energy systems that consume carbon-based fuels on-site (including, where applicable, the construction or expansion of energy plants controlled by the developer that may be necessary to produce energy for that specific building), which shall include the cost of installation, maintenance and upkeep of the energy system and its components (incorporating programs and incentives as set forth in Paragraph (5) above). This paragraph will become effective on February 23, 2021.  \n\n  7. Embodied Emissions: A full lifecycle analysis of the estimated emissions generated by the construction of the Green Building Project. The Community Development Department shall promulgate regulations for how these estimated emissions are to be reported. Such regulations shall include at minimum the required reporting of estimated lifecycle emissions generated by the use of major building materials, including but not limited to wood, concrete, steel, aluminum and glass, using Passive House or other acceptable energy and emissions modeling software and industry standards. This paragraph will become effective on July 1, 2023, and shall not impose a requirement on any Green Building Project that is a project of the Affordable Housing Trust or otherwise for the construction of low and moderate-income housing meeting the standards established pursuant to any City, State or Federal housing program designed to assist low and moderate-income households.",

            "title": "Revised MBTA Bus Redesign",
            "text": "WHEREAS: A robust, affordable, and effective public transportation system provides essential services to residents and directly helps the city achieve goals of reducing emission pollution and increasing equity and economic prosperity; and  \n  \n   WHEREAS: The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) proposed the second iteration of their plans for a [bus network redesign](https://www.mbta.com/projects/bus-network-redesign/update/revised-\nbus-network-map) on account of shifting demographics, emerging employment districts, increasing traffic congestion, and changing travel patterns within the Greater Boston Area in recent years; and   WHEREAS: These changes will impact routes that operate within the City of Cambridge, as was discussed during a recent Transportation and Public Utilities Committee\n[hearing](https://cambridgema.iqm2.com/Citizens/Detail_Meeting.aspx?ID=4141)\nand the City Council has gone on\n[record](http://cambridgema.iqm2.com/Citizens/Detail_LegiFile.aspx?Frame=&MeetingID=4102&MediaPosition=&ID=16629&CssClass=)\nin support of more bus service in the Alewife region as well as in East Cambridge not included in the first bus network redesign; and   WHEREAS: The MBTA revised their [original](https://www.mbta.com/projects/bus-network-\nredesign/update/bus-network-redesign-proposal) proposal based on over 20,000 comments in order to improve access to hospitals, senior centers, and other destinations; reduce walk distances for riders; preserve existing one-seat rides; and balance resources and stays within the limit of buses available during peak times; and   WHEREAS: The October redesign has made several improvements to bus access in Cambridge,\nincluding extending Route T47 to Union Square from its original terminus in Central Square and reinstating Route 87 near Lechmere, extending service to 1:00am; and working to address high frequency routes across the system; and   WHEREAS: While the October redesign has addressed many of the issues brought forward by the community, many notable concerns still exist, namely:\n\n\u00b7 Routes 68 and 78 should extend rush hour schedules from 3:00pm - 8:00pm to better serve students in afterschool activities;\n\n\u00b7 Route 78 provides access to Neighborhood Nine, Cambridge Highlands, Concord Ave between Huron and Blanchard Rd, including the assisted care and medical facilities; it is also the only connector between West Cambridge and Arlington: reduced midday service is a concern, though, we believe that weekend service is improved;\n\n\u00b7 The MBTA is proposing very little change to the schedules of;\n\n\u00b7 Routes 69 and 83; the MBTA should improve the frequencies of both routes  to account for rush hour needs of the population including vulnerable populations;\n These routes should be reconsidered to better account for the needs of Cambridge; and   WHEREAS: Changes in routes west of Harvard Square, including #74 and #75 need to be assessed carefully in light of new housing units including affordable housing for many residents without cars who rely on public transportation more than others\n\n\u00b7 As of right now, the MBTA has restored service on Route 74 from Belmont Center to Harvard via Concord Ave and is also proposing Sunday service on Route 74;\n\n\u00b7 There have been no changes to Route 75 in the newest proposal which is essential for many CRLS students; and   WHEREAS: The dedicated CRLS bus on Routes 72 and 75 on school mornings provides essential transportation services for high school students to get to school on time and should be reinstated and additional dedicated CRLS routes considered for other areas of the city; and   WHEREAS: The City Council expects the MBTA to respond to items from the joint letter from the Mayor and City Manager including:\n\n\u00b7 Route 68 to continue to have all-day service\n\n\u00b7 Extend Route 68 to Lechmere or connect the 68 to a new Kendall-Chelsea service\n\n\u00b7 Extend the T109 into Allston to connect with the Harvard development; and   WHEREAS: Without further changes to address these concerns, the plan could have an adverse impact on the city\u2019s goals of increasing public transit overall to reduced emission pollution, and on residents who rely on public transit and who cannot afford vehicles, including senior citizens and other residents of limited mobility, students who rely on public transportation for school and afterschool activities, and many public housing residents who will be further isolated if public transit options are reduced, instead of increased; now therefore be it   ORDERED: That the City Council go on record in support of the changes that improved access and in support of further changes to address the concerns of residents as summarized above; and be it further   ORDERED: That the City Council hereby requests that the City Manager reach out to the MBTA to discuss the need for further amendments to the proposed plan for bus routes and to strategize on how the MBTA can keep their promised 25% increase in service and double the number of high frequency corridors considering the\n[challenges they face hiring new drivers](https://www.masstransitmag.com/bus/news/21285542/ma-mbta-needs-to-\nhire-750-drivers-to-implement-better-bus-network-plan); and be it further   ORDERED: That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a suitably engrossed copy of this resolution to representatives at the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) and to the Cambridge state delegation on behalf of the entire City Council.",

            "text": "WHEREAS: The Affordable Housing Overlay (AHO) has so far generated a healthy pipeline of six projects since it was first ordained in 2020; and  \n  \n   WHEREAS: Though there is much to celebrate about the work that has been done, two years of implementation have also revealed that the somewhat inflexible dimensional requirements of the AHO have proven to be more of an obstacle than expected;\nand   WHEREAS: The recent [annual report](https://cambridgema.iqm2.com/Citizens/Detail_LegiFile.aspx?Frame=&MeetingID=4102&MediaPosition=&ID=16650&CssClass=)\nrevealed ten instances where affordable housing providers \u201cdecided not to pursue\u201d and four instances where they actually made an offer but it was rejected; and   WHEREAS: The proposal to build 49 affordable units at 2072 Mass Ave was not able to take advantage of the AHO and was withdrawn in August 2021 after it became apparent that a feasible version of the project wouldn\u2019t be approved under 40B; and   WHEREAS: It is clear that some refinements to the AHO would result in more new affordable housing and fewer missed or stalled opportunities; and   WHEREAS: Offering substantially relaxed dimensional requirements on a citywide network of corridors and squares will allow more projects to advance, especially considering the recent linkage fee increase; and   WHEREAS: Permitting additional height when green area open space is protected or expanded will add flexibility and expand options around providing such space without sacrificing any affordable housing production; and   WHEREAS: The active affordable housing developers in Cambridge are in agreement that these changes will make a big difference; now therefore be it   ORDERED: That the City Council refer the attached zoning petition to the Housing and Neighborhood & Long Term Planning, Public Facilities, Arts & Celebration Committees   |   11.207.5.1 General Provisions\n\n(a) For the purposes of this Section, the phrase \"District Development Standards\" shall refer to the development standards of the base zoning district as they may be modified by the development standards of all overlay districts (with the exception of this Affordable Housing Overlay) that are applicable to a lot.\n\n(b) District Dimensional Standards shall include the most permissive standards allowable on a lot, whether such standards are permitted as-of-right or allowable by special permit.

The resulting projected elevations are referred to herein as Long-Term Flood Elevations (\u201cLTFEs\u201d).\n\n(b) LTFEs shall be determined for flood risk due to precipitation based on piped infrastructure using the City\u2019s hydraulic model, and for flood risk due to sea level rise and storm surge based on climate modeling performed by or endorsed by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts\u2019s agencies and determined by the City Engineer to represent the most reliable and up-to-date scientific analysis of future climate conditions. Whenever promulgating new LTFEs, the City Engineer shall document the source data used to determine the LTFEs and shall provide an explanation of why such data was selected.\n\n(c) LTFEs shall be based on an approximately 50-year projection from the time of promulgation. For example, LTFEs promulgated in or around the year 2020 shall anticipate flood risks in or around the year 2070. The City Engineer shall identify the projected timeframe when promulgating LTFEs.\n\n(d) LTFEs shall be represented in vertical feet relative to the Cambridge City Base (CCB) datum.\n\n(e) LTFEs shall be presented in the form of data tables that provide the numerical LTFEs for each parcel identified on the Cambridge Assessing Map and may also be presented in the form of a physical or digital map (for example,\nthe Cambridge \u201cFloodViewer\u201d or any successor map) illustrating the LTFEs for different probabilities of flood risk for different types of flooding (i.e.,\nprecipitation, sea level rise, and storm surge) across the City. Such a map may be presented and/or illustrated in relation to ground elevation data collected by the City of Cambridge through light detection and ranging (LIDAR)\nor other technology; however, if a property owner provides a property survey performed by a licensed surveyor, such survey shall be considered more accurate than ground elevation data collected by the City of Cambridge.\nProperty surveys shall not alter the LTFEs but may affect the relative difference between the LTFE and the Grade on a given parcel.\n\n(f) New or revised LTFEs shall be made available to the public for comment no less than 90 days prior to final promulgation.\n 22.83.2 Application in Zoning.\n\n(a) For the purpose of this Section, the following LTFE standards promulgated by the City Engineer as set forth above shall be applicable to development on a lot or development parcel:\n\n(1)The 1%-Probability Long-Term Flood Elevation standard, or \u201c1%-LTFE standard,\u201d shall refer to the projected elevation of floodwater that has a one percent annual chance of occurrence due to either sea level rise and storm surge or due to precipitation, whichever is higher.\n\n(2) The 10%-Probability Long-Term Flood Elevation standard, or \u201c10%-LTFE standard,\u201d shall refer to the projected elevation of floodwater that has a ten percent annual chance of occurrence due to either sea level rise and storm surge or due to precipitation, whichever is higher.\n\n(b) For the purpose of this Section, then current LTFE standards shall be applicable to a lot or development parcel beginning on the date of final promulgation. However, a development proposal that has already submitted a LTFE plan that has been approved in writing by DPW, in accordance with Section 22.85 below, shall not be subject to LTFE standards promulgated after the date of such written approval, provided that the proposal receives all necessary permits including but not limited to a building or special permit and proceeds thereafter continuously and expeditiously to completion.\n 22.84 Development Standards.\n 22.84.1 Protection. A Story Above Grade or portion thereof shall be considered protected from flooding to a specified LTFE standard if its finished floor is higher in elevation than the LTFE standard, or if its finished floor is lower than the LTFE standard, there are permanent or passively deployable barriers in place at the height of the LTFE standard adequate to fully prevent the entry of floodwater into the building\u2019s interior. A Story Below Grade or any portion thereof shall be considered a finished floor protected from flooding to a specified LTFE standard if the LTFE standard is below the Grade adjoining the building, or if the LTFE standard is above the Grade adjoining the building, there are permanent or passively deployable barriers in place at the height of the LTFE standard adequate to fully prevent the entry of floodwater into the interior of the Story Below Grade. The following standards shall apply:\n\n(a) All occupiable spaces within the building, as defined in the State Building Code, shall be protected to the 10%-LTFE standard, except that small entryways, vestibules, or lobbies with a finished floor below the 10%-LTFE standard are allowed to not be protected if they contain stairs, ramps, or lifts that allow occupants to travel to portions of the building that are protected, and if they meet the standards for \u201cRecovery\u201d set forth in Section 22.84.2 below.\n\n(b) Habitable spaces for residential use, as defined in the State Building Code, shall be protected to the 1%-LTFE standard.\n\n(c) The following critical building equipment within the building or on the site shall be protected to the 1%-LTFE standard: mechanical heating and cooling systems including fuel storage tanks, supply meters, shut-off switches and building management system controls; electrical power supply,\ntransformers, panels, switchgear, and safety equipment including electrical shut-off equipment, backup generators and their fuel sources; water heaters and water supply related equipment; telecommunications equipment; elevator and lift equipment.\n 22.84.2 Flood Recovery. A portion of a building shall be considered recoverable from the impact of flooding if floodwater is able to enter and leave the space without causing damage that cannot be readily repaired. This can be achieved through various strategies, including using permanent or contingent measures that prevent or provide resistance to flood damage, or that can be easily repaired or replaced if damaged. Portions of a building located at or below the 10%-LTFE standard that are not required to be protected in Section 22.84.1 above shall be designed to be recoverable.\n 22.84.3 Modifications. Upon granting a special permit, the Planning Board may approve modifications to the development standards set forth in Section 22.84.1 and 22.84.2 above after finding that a proposed development is designed to meet the intent of the standards in a manner that is more suitable to the unique conditions of the development or the site. No such modification may be approved under this section unless it has been reviewed and approved in writing by the City Engineer.\n 22.85 Administrative Review Procedures. Before applying for any special permit from the Planning Board, any development review procedure under Article 19.000 of the Zoning Ordinance, or a Building Permit, whichever occurs sooner, the documentation listed below shall be submitted to the Department of Public Works (DPW) for review.

The provisions of this Ordinance governing the height of buildings and structures in all districts shall generally not apply to the following:\n\n(a) chimneys, water towers, air conditioning equipment, elevator bulkheads,\nskylights, ventilators and other necessary features appurtenant to buildings which are usually carried above roofs and are not used for human occupancy;\n\n(b) domes, towers, or spires above buildings if such features are not used for human occupancy and occupy less than ten percent (10%) of the lot area;\n\n(c) wireless or broadcasting towers and other like unenclosed structures which occupy less than ten percent (10%) of the lot area;\n\n(d) Wind Turbines, subject to the requirements and limitations set forth in Section 22.70;\n\n(e) elements of a Solar Energy System, as defined in Section 22.60 of this Zoning Ordinance, that would ordinarily be located on a rooftop where they would have direct exposure to sunlight;\n\n(f) beehives and apiaries extending no more than six (6) feet above a rooftop,\nin accordance with the Standards for Urban Agriculture in Article 23.000 of this Zoning Ordinance; and\n\n(g) structures appurtenant to Green Roof Area or usable outdoor space adjacent to a Green Roof Area, including but not limited to elevator and stair access headhouses and Shade Canopies located above the roof, provided that the area of such features is less than the total adjacent Green Roof Area.\n 5.23.1 Building elements enumerated in (a) and (g) above shall be limited in height where they are placed on a building located in a non-residential district, which district abuts a Residence A-1, A-2, B, C, C-1, C-1A, C-2,\nC-2A, C-2B district. In these instances, the following height limitations shall apply to those building elements:\n\n(a) The elements must be below one or more forty-five (45) degree bulk control planes. Each bulk control plane shall begin, in the vertical dimension, at the maximum height limit permitted in the non-residential zoning district. In the horizontal dimension, the plane shall begin at the residential/non-residential zoning district line: however, where that line lies within a street, the plane shall begin at the front lot line, located nearest the zoning district line,\nof the lots on which the building is sited. Thereafter the bulk control plane shall rise from its beginning over the non-residential zoning district. (See illustrative figure 5.23)\n\n(b) The limitations in Paragraph 1 above may be waived by special permit from the Planning Board upon a finding by the Board that the additional height is necessary. In making that determination the Planning Board shall consider the special and unique requirements of the use that the elements are serving, any special constraints imposed by the site upon which the building is located,\nthe nature and character of development in the adjacent residential district,\nand the extent to which successful efforts are made to minimize the visual and acoustical impact of the elements on neighbors.\n 5.23.2 If the Ground Story of a building is elevated to meet the Flood Resilience Standards in Section 22.80 of this Zoning Ordinance, then the allowed height of buildings and structures as set forth in this Zoning Ordinance may be increased as-of-right to compensate for the difference between the Ground Story finished floor elevation and the Grade elevation.\nHowever, the allowed increase in height shall be no greater than the difference in elevation between the 1%-Probability Long-Term Flood Elevation as described in Section 22.80 and the Grade, or four (4) feet, whichever is less. The City Engineer shall certify that the Flood Resilience Standards in Section 22.80 are met prior to issuance of a building permit for a building or structure utilizing the provisions of this Section 5.23.2.\n 5.24 Yards.\n 5.24.1 Every part of a required yard shall be open to the sky and unobstructed, except that the following features may be located within a required yard:\n\n(a) Awnings, arbors, fences, flagpoles, recreational, and laundry drying equipment and similar objects;\n\n(b) Objects or structures intended exclusively for bicycle parking meeting the requirements of Article 6.000, which may be uncovered, partially covered or fully enclosed, provided that such objects or structures are not used for motor vehicle parking, general storage or any other use, and further provided that any such structure exceeding six feet (6') in height conforms to the requirements for an accessory building in Section 4.21;\n\n(c) Beehives and apiaries no more than six (6\u2019) feet in height, in accordance with the Standards for Urban Agriculture in Article 23.000 of this Zoning Ordinance;\n\n(d) Objects or equipment located in a required yard that are necessary for or appurtenant to a Public Bicycle-Sharing Station;\n\n(e) Open or lattice-enclosed fire escapes for emergency use only;\n\n(f) Projecting eaves, chimneys, bay windows, balconies, open fire escapes and like projections which do not project more than three and one-half (3\u00bd\u2019) feet and which are part of a building not more than thirty-five (35\u2019) feet in height;\n\n(g) Shade Canopies as defined in this Zoning Ordinance, provided that any Shade Canopy exceeding seven feet (7\u2019) in height shall be set back at least five feet (5\u2019) from a side or rear lot line in a residential district; and\n\n(h) Exterior steps, ramps, elevated walkways, porches, window wells, flood barriers, and other elevated features that provide protection or resilience from flooding on the lot, provided such features do not project more than twelve (12\u2019) feet beyond the line of the foundation wall of a building, are open to the air and are either unroofed or covered only by a Shade Canopy, and are not elevated higher than four (4\u2019) feet above Grade or the 1%-Probability Long Term Flood Elevation as determined by the Flood Resilience Standards in Section 22.80 of this Zoning Ordinance, whichever is higher.\n 5.24.2 Existing conforming or pre-existing non-conforming buildings in existence prior to August 2, 2010, may encroach or further encroach into a required yard solely in order to install exterior insulation to an existing exterior wall, provided that such existing exterior wall is not moved or demolished except to remove and replace its exterior wall covering and that the requirements of either Paragraph (a) or Paragraph (b) below are met:\n\n(a) The yard is not decreased by more than eight (8\u201c) inches from the pre-\nexisting condition, the wall itself does not intrude more than eight (8\u201d)\ninches further into the existing yard, and the outer plane of the exterior wall after the installation of exterior insulation and exterior wall covering is not closer than three (3\u2019) feet to the nearest property line; or\n\n(b) The Board of Zoning Appeal (BZA) has granted a special permit to exceed the limitations of Paragraph (a) above upon finding that, given the unique physical constraints of the building or the site, such relief is necessary to install exterior insulation that will substantively improve the thermal performance of the exterior wall envelope, that potential impacts to the safety or privacy of abutting uses will be mitigated, and that the general criteria set forth in Section 10.43 of this Zoning Ordinance are met.\n 5.24.3 On lots abutting streets on more than one side, the front yard requirements of each of the abutting streets shall apply regardless of designated front lot lines. Any remaining sides shall be subject to side yard requirements.\n 5.24.4 Measurements for minimum yards which are determined by formula shall be made in the following manner:\n\n(1) \"H\" is the height of the building. \"L\" is the length of the wall measured parallel to the corresponding lot or street line. The front yard is measured from the street line, or building line where such has been established, except where otherwise indicated herein. For buildings of forty (40\u2019) feet or less in height the denominator in the yard formulas in the Tables in Section 5.30 may be increased by two subject to the minimum yard requirements set forth in footnotes a, b and c of Tables 5-1 and 5-2.\n\n(2) Where a building consists of various roof levels an average height, or\n\"H\", may be used in the required yard formula. Average height is determined by adding the products of the height of each roof level facing the given lot line, (H1, H2, etc.) times the length of each roof level (L1, L2, etc.) and dividing the sum by the sum of the length of the levels (L1, L2, etc.) (see formula below)\n\n![](/Citizens/GetImage.aspx?Type=25&ID=/Aspose.Words.92022b23-652a-4c50-b13e-09e2c4743818.001.png)\n\n(3) Where a building presents a variety of vertical planes to any given lot or street line, no plane shall be closer to the street or building line or lot line than permitted by the application to such plane of the appropriate formula in the tables of dimensional requirements in Section 5.30. For all planes set forward of the setback line required by said tables for the building if it were constructed in a single vertical plane, other planes must be set behind the setback line so calculated. The result shall be that the sum of the products of the setback required for each plane times the facing area of each plane respectively shall be at least as great as the product of the setback required by the appropriate table for the building if it were constructed in a single vertical plane times the facing area of the building if viewed as a single plane. (See illustration below):\n The product of (setback1 x facing area1) + (setback2 x facing area2) MUST EQUAL OR EXCEED the product of (single plane setback) x (single plane facing area).\n 5.25 Gross Floor Area (GFA) and Floor Area Ratio (FAR)\n 5.25.1 Gross Floor Area shall include:\n\n(a)Roofed porches and balconies that are enclosed on more than fifty percent\n(50%) of their perimeter and do not meet the definition of Shaded Area;\n\n(b)Unroofed porches and balconies above the third floor except as provided in Section 5.25.2(j);\n\n(c)Elevator shafts and stairwells on each floor, not excluded in Section 5.25.2(c) or (f) ;\n\n(d)Attic space, whether finished or unfinished, within the area of a horizontal plane that is five (5) feet above the attic floor and which touches the side walls and/or the underside of the roof rafters and which is not excluded in Section 5.25.2(f);\n\n(e)Interior balconies, mezzanines, and penthouses, and the area of each floor level of any interior courtyard in a building with more than two floors,\nwhether or not covered by a roof, which has a minimum dimension of less than forty (40) feet in any direction unless twenty (20) percent or more of the perimeter of such courtyard at each floor level measured consecutively is not enclosed;\n\n(f)Area of parking facilities in structures except as excluded in 5.25.2(b);\nand\n\n(g)Any accessory parking spaces not in above ground structures if in excess of the maximum number permitted on the premises as set forth in Section 5.25.3 and 6.30.\n 5.25.2 Gross Floor Area shall not include:\n\n(a)Areas used for off street loading purposes;\n\n(b)Area of parking facilities in structures located underground and the area of on grade open parking spaces outside the building footprint at or below the maximum number permitted on the premises as set forth in Sections 5.25.3 and 6.30;\n\n(c)Area in Stories Below Grade that meets at least one of the following criteria:\n\n(i) The area has less than seven feet (7\u2019) of ceiling height measured from the floor to the line of the bottom of the floor joists above, or to any subfloor or finished surface above any floor joists that are spaced not less than four\n(4) feet on center; or\n\n(iii) The area is designed in accordance with the Flood Resilience Standards set forth in Section 22.80 of this Zoning Ordinance.\n\n(d)Open and lattice-work fire escapes;\n\n(e)Unroofed porches and balconies no higher than the third floor;\n\n(f)Areas located in any part of a building or site devoted to elevator machinery or mechanical equipment necessary for the operation and maintenance of the building, including heating and cooling equipment, electrical and telephone facilities, fuel storage, and sustainable mechanical systems and related equipment and chases for systems including, but not limited to, solar energy systems, geothermal systems and heat pumps, solar hot water systems and related tubes and tanks, equipment related to radiant heating, hydronic cooling, heat recovery ventilators, and energy recovery ventilators;\n\n(g)Elevator shafts and stairwells on floors where there is no other area which qualifies to be included in Gross Floor Area, including headhouses that provide access to Green Roof Area;\n\n(h)Attic space not included in Section 5.25.1(d);\n\n(i)Bicycle parking meeting or exceeding the requirements of Article 6.000,\nwhich shall include all areas occupied by Bicycle Parking Spaces and access routes intended exclusively for use by bicycles, which shall be clearly indicated in the bicycle parking plan requirements set forth in Section 6.52.1 whether located in a principal use structure, any parking facility for motor vehicles, or in an accessory structure;\n\n(j) Green Roof Area as defined in this Zoning Ordinance and constructed in accordance with the standards in Section 22.30 of this Zoning Ordinance,\nwhether or not it meets the minimum Green Roofs Requirement in Section 22.35,\nas well as the area of adjacent impervious walkways, decks, and access headhouses intended for maintenance or enjoyment of the Green Roof Area,\nprovided that such area is not greater than the Green Roof Area;\n\n(k)Interior air spaces within a Double-Skin Fa\u00e7ade as defined in Article 2.000 of this Zoning Ordinance, up to a maximum depth of one (1) foot, provided the space is not to be accessed except for maintenance purposes;\n\n(l)Insulating material attached to the exterior of the structural elements of an external building wall.\n\n(m)Shaded Area as defined in this Zoning Ordinance;\n\n(n)Public Bicycle-Sharing Stations.\n 5.25.3 FAR Exceptions for Parking and Loading Facilities.\n 5.25.3.1 Loading Facilities. Areas used for off-street loading purposes shall be exempt from the requirements as to Floor Area Ratio but shall conform to all other requirements of the district in which it is located.\n 5.25.3.2 Parking Facilities in Structures. The floor area of an underground parking garage and the floor area of the underground portion of a structure devoted in whole or in part to parking automobiles, shall not be counted as Gross Floor Area and shall be exempt from the requirements as to floor area but shall conform to all other requirements of the district in which it is located. All other parking in structures shall be subject to the requirements as to Floor Area Ratio.\n 5.25.3.21 Area of Parking Facility. For the purposes of this Section 5.25.3 the area of parking in a structure shall include all parking spaces, access drives, aisles and other elements of the parking facility and shall include any portion of a parking facility located at grade beneath a building but not otherwise enclosed.\n 5.25.3.22 Definition of Underground. For the purposes of this Section 5.25.3 only, \u201cunderground \u201c shall mean either of the following:\n\n(1)The location of the entire parking facility below the finished grade of the ground abutting the structure, or the underground portion thereof, which grade is maintained naturally without any structural support.

The height above mean grade shall be measured to the roof of the facility, or to the ceiling should the facility be set entirely below other non-parking elements of a building.\n 5.25.3.3 Exemption for Existing Parking Facilities. Structured parking facilities in existence on or before September 15, 2000, or constructed and occupied at a later date pursuant to a building or special permit in conformance with all provisions of Chapter 40A issued prior to the effective date of the provisions of this Section 5.25, shall not be subject to the requirements as to Floor Area Ratio.\n 5.25.3.4 Exceptions to the Provisions of this Section 5.25.3\n 5.25.3.41 Exemption for Residential Parking Spaces. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.25.3.2 above, the following structured parking located above ground, accessory to a residential use, shall not be calculated as part of the Gross Floor Area on the lot:\n\n(1) One parking space located within a townhouse unit or a one, two or three family dwelling.\n\n(2) A freestanding parking structure containing no more than one parking space per dwelling unit up to a maximum of three parking spaces on a lot containing a one, two or three family dwelling.\n\n(3) One parking space per dwelling unit, up to a maximum of fifteen (15)\nspaces, for multifamily dwellings.\n 5.25.3.42 Where an above ground parking facility in a structure is proposed to be constructed (a) in the 100-year flood plain, identified as the Zone A flood hazard area (See Section 11.70), or as determined by credible evidence and calculations from a registered professional engineer or (b) on a contaminated site that is listed by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection under the Massachusetts Contingency Plan (310 CMR 40.00) with a Release Tracking Number and has been tier classified, the Planning Board may grant a special permit to waive the limitations of this Section 5.25.3 so that the parking facility is not subject to the requirements in this Ordinance as to Floor Area Ratio provided only the minimum number of parking spaces required for the uses on the site are provided. In granting such a special permit, the Planning Board shall find the following:\n\n(1) Where in a flood hazard area, the construction of a parking facility underground is (a) not technically feasible due to the requirements of the Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act (M.G.L. ch. 131, s.40, (b) would require construction that would violate requirements or limitations of the Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act, (c) would, in the view of the Cambridge Conservation Commission, seriously compromise the wetlands protection objectives of the Massachusetts Wetlands Protection Act), and (d) would result in costs of construction that are significantly greater than would otherwise be typical for the location were it not in a flood hazard area; or\n\n(2) Where the site is contaminated, the construction of a parking facility underground (a) would, in the opinion of a Licensed Site Professional, pose significant risks to public health or the environment through disturbance of hazardous materials and could not be reasonably mitigated in accordance with state and federal regulations, (b) require construction that is prohibited by state or federal regulations related to hazardous wastes, and (c) would result in costs of construction that would render the project financially unfeasible;\nand\n\n(3) The above ground facility is designed so as to reduce its actual or perceived bulk through, among other possible techniques, limiting the number of parking spaces it contains, placement of portions of the facility below grade where feasible, or its location relative to actively occupied portions of the construction. Construction above grade is discouraged that would increase the amount of impervious area on the lot.\n\n  \n Amend Section 19.24 (Application Procedures for a Project Review Special Permit) to read as follows:\n 19.24 Application Procedures. An application for the Project Review Special Permit shall be made to the Planning Board. The Application shall consist of the following materials:\n\n(1) Planning Board Special Permit Application Form. The application shall include all required plans and narrative statements.

It is understood that application of these principles can vary with the context of specific building proposals in ways that, nevertheless, fully respect the policies' intent. It is intended that proponents of projects, city staff, the Planning Board, and the general public, where public review or approval is required, should be open to creative variations from the detailed provisions presented in this Section as long as the core values expressed are being served. A project need not meet all the objectives of this Section 19.30 where this Section serves as the basis for issuance of a special permit. Rather, the permit granting authority shall find that, on balance, the objectives of the city are being served. Nor shall a project subject to special permit review be required to conform to the Required Building and Site Plan Requirements set forth in Section 19.50.\n Further indicators of conformance with these policy objectives shall be found in planning documents and plans developed for specific areas of the City or the City as a whole, to the extent that they are not inconsistent with the objectives set forth in this Section 19.30. These documents include the Harvard Square Development Guidelines, the Central Square Action Plan, the Central Square Development Guidelines, the North Massachusetts Avenue Urban Design Guidelines Handbook, the University Park at MIT Urban Design Guidelines, the North Point Policy Plan and Design Guidelines, the Cambridge Institutional Growth Management Plan, the East Cambridge Riverfront Plan, the Eastern Cambridge Plan, the Eastern Cambridge Design Guidelines, the Alewife Revitalization, Alewife Urban Design Study Phase II and its Draft update of 1991, and Toward a Sustainable Future: Cambridge Growth Policy Document.\n 19.31 New projects should be responsive to the existing or anticipated pattern of development. Indicators include:\n\n(1) Heights and setbacks provide suitable transition to abutting or nearby residential zoning districts that are generally developed to low scale residential uses.\n\n(2) New buildings are designed and oriented on the lot so as to be consistent with the established streetscape on those streets on which the project lot abuts. Streetscape is meant to refer to the pattern of building setbacks and heights in relationship to public streets.\n\n(3) In mixed-use projects, uses are to be located carefully to respect the context, e.g. retail should front onto a street, new housing should relate to any adjacent existing residential use, etc.\n\n(4) Where relevant, historical context is respected, e.g. special consideration should be given to buildings on the site or neighboring buildings that are preferably preserved.\n 19.32 Development should be pedestrian and bicycle-friendly, with a positive relationship to its surroundings. Indicators include:\n\n(1) Ground floors, particularly where they face public streets, public parks,\nand publicly accessible pathways, consist of spaces that are actively inhabited by people, such as retail stores, consumer service businesses and restaurants where they are allowed, or general office, educational or residential uses and building lobbies. Windows and doors that normally serve such inhabited spaces are encouraged to be a prominent aspect of the relevant building facades. Where a mix of activities are accommodated in a building,\nthe more active uses are encouraged facing public streets, parks, and pathways.\n In commercial districts, such active space consists of retail and consumer service stores and building lobbies that are oriented toward the street and encourage pedestrian activity on the sidewalk. However, in all cases such ground floor spaces should be occupied by uses (a) permitted in the zoning district within which the building is located, (b) consistent with the general character of the environment within which the structure is located, and (c)\ncompatible with the principal use for which the building is designed.\n\n(2) Covered parking on the lower floors of a building and on-grade open parking, particularly where located in front of a building, is discouraged where a building faces a public street or public park, and publicly accessible pathways.\n\n(3) Ground floors should be generally 25-50% transparent. The greatest amounts of glass would be expected for retail uses with lesser amounts for office,\ninstitutional or residential use.\n\n(4) Entries to buildings are located so as to ensure safe pedestrian movement across streets, encourage walking as a preferred mode of travel within the city and to encourage the use of public transit for employment and other trips. Relating building entries as directly as possible to crosswalks and to pathways that lead to bus stops and transit stations is encouraged; siting buildings on a lot and developing site plans that reinforce expected pedestrian pathways over the lot and through the district is also encouraged.\n\n(5) Pedestrians and bicyclists are able to access the site safely and conveniently; bicyclists should have secure weatherproof storage facilities conveniently located on-site. If bicycle parking is provided in a garage,\nspecial attention must be paid to providing safe access to the facilities from the outside.\n\n(6) Alternate means of serving policy objective 19.32 through special building design, siting, or site design can be anticipated where the building form or use is distinctive such as freestanding parking structures, large institutional buildings such as churches and auditoriums, freestanding service buildings, power plants, athletic facilities, manufacturing plants, etc.\n 19.33 The building and site design should mitigate adverse environmental impacts of a development upon its neighbors. Indicators include:\n\n(1) Mechanical equipment that is carefully designed, well organized or visually screened from its surroundings and is acoustically buffered from neighbors. Consideration is given to the size, complexity and appearance of the equipment, its proximity to residential areas, and its impact on the existing streetscape and skyline. The extent to which screening can bring order, lessen negative visual impacts, and enhance the overall appearance of the equipment should be taken into account. More specifically:\n\n(a) Reasonable attempts have been made to avoid exposing rooftop mechanical equipment to public view from city streets. Among the techniques that might be considered are the inclusion of screens or a parapet around the roof of the building to shield low ducts and other equipment on the roof from view.\n\n(b) Treatment of the mechanical equipment (including design and massing of screening devices as well as exposed mechanical elements) that relates well to the overall design, massing, scale and character of the building.\n\n(c) Placement of mechanical equipment in enclosed locations within the building (if it does not violate the Flood Resilience Standards in Section 22.80), which reduces the bulk of elements located on the roof; however, at-\ngrade locations external to the building should not be viewed as desirable alternatives and should be visually and acoustically screened with fencing and/or landscape features wherever they are necessary.\n\n(d) Tall elements, such as chimneys and air exhaust stacks, which are typically carried above screening devices for functioning reasons, are carefully designed as features of the building, thus creating interest on the skyline.\n\n(e) All aspects of the mechanical equipment have been designed with attention to their visual impact on adjacent areas, particularly with regard to residential neighborhoods and views and vistas.\n\n(2) Trash that is handled to avoid impacts (noise, odor, and visual quality)\non neighbors, e.g. the use of trash compactors or containment of all trash storage and handling within a building is encouraged.\n\n(3) Loading docks that are located and designed to minimize impacts (visual and operational) on neighbors.\n\n(4) Stormwater Best Management Practices and other measures to minimize runoff and improve water quality are implemented.\n\n(5) Landscaped areas and required Green Area Open Space, in addition to serving as visual amenities, are employed to reduce the rate and volume of stormwater runoff compared to pre-development conditions.\n\n(6) The structure is designed and sited to minimize shadow impacts on neighboring lots, especially shadows that would have a significant impact on the use and enjoyment of adjacent open space and shadows that might impact the operation of a Registered Solar Energy System as defined in Section 22.80 of this Zoning Ordinance.\n\n(7) Changes in grade across the lot are designed in ways that minimize the need for structural retaining walls close to property lines.\n\n(8) Building scale and wall treatment, including the provision of windows, are sensitive to existing residential uses on adjacent lots.\n\n(9) Outdoor lighting is designed to provide minimum lighting and necessary to ensure adequate safety, night vision, and comfort, while minimizing light pollution.\n\n(10) The creation of a Tree Protection Plan that identifies important trees on the site, encourages their protection, or provides for adequate replacement of trees lost to development on the site.\n 19.34 Projects should not overburden the City infrastructure services,\nincluding neighborhood roads, city water supply system, and sewer system.\nIndicators include:\n\n(1) The building and site design are designed to make use of water-conserving plumbing and minimize the amount of stormwater run-off through the use of best management practices for stormwater management.\n\n(2) The capacity and condition of drinking water and wastewater infrastructure systems are shown to be adequate, or the steps necessary to bring them up to an acceptable level are identified.\n\n(3) Buildings are designed to use natural resources and energy resources efficiently in construction, maintenance, and long-term operation of the building, including supporting mechanical systems that reduce the need for mechanical equipment generally and its location on the roof of a building specifically. The buildings are sited on the lot to allow construction on adjacent lots to do the same. Exceeding the Green Building Requirements set forth in Section 22.20 of this Zoning Ordinance and other evolving environmentally sustainable standards is encouraged.\n 19.35 New construction should reinforce and enhance the complex urban aspects of Cambridge as it has developed historically. Indictors include:\n\n(1) New educational institutional construction that is focused within the existing campuses.\n\n(2) Where institutional construction occurs in commercial areas, retail,\nconsumer service enterprises, and other uses that are accessible to the general public are provided at the ground (or lower) floors of buildings.\nWhere such uses are not suitable for programmatic reasons, institutional uses that encourage active pedestrian traffic to and from the site.\n\n(3) In large, multiple-building non-institutional developments, a mix of uses,\nincluding publicly accessible retail activity, is provided where such uses are permitted and where the mix of uses extends the period of time the area remains active throughout the day.\n\n(4) Historic structures and environments are preserved.\n\n(5) Preservation or provision of facilities for start-up companies and appropriately scaled manufacturing activities that provide a wide diversity of employment paths for Cambridge residents as a component of the development;\nhowever, activities heavily dependent on trucking for supply and distribution are not encouraged.\n 19.36 Expansion of the inventory of housing in the city is encouraged.\nIndicators include:\n\n(1) Housing is a component of any large, multiple building commercial development. Where such development abuts residential zoning districts substantially developed to low-scale residential uses, placement of housing within the development such that it acts as a transition/buffer between uses within and without the development.\n\n(2) Where housing is constructed, providing affordable units exceeding that mandated by the Ordinance. Targeting larger family-sized middle-income units is encouraged.\n 19.37 Enhancement and expansion of open space amenities in the city should be incorporated into new development in the city. Indicators include:\n\n(1) On large-parcel commercial developments, publicly beneficial open space is provided.\n\n(2) Open space facilities are designed to enhance or expand existing facilities or to expand networks of pedestrian and bicycle movement within the vicinity of the development.\n\n(3) A wider range of open space activities than presently found in the abutting area is provided.\n 19.38 Development should be resilient to the effects of climate change as anticipated in the Resilient Cambridge plan published by the City. Indicators include:\n\n(1) The design has incorporated the most up-to-date projections of climate change impacts over the project\u2019s anticipated lifespan, including increases in temperature and precipitation and risk of future flooding.\n\n(2) The project is designed to meet or exceed the Flood Resilience Standard in Section 22.80 of this Zoning Ordinance and the Green Factor Standard in Section 22.90 of this Zoning Ordinance. Design strategies may be supplemented by mitigation strategies to manage the effects of flooding and heat where appropriate.\n\n(3) The design uses resilience strategies that have environmental co-benefits.\nAn example is passive building envelope design, which promotes occupant comfort during extreme heat and resilience from power outages due to storms while also reducing energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. Another example is intensive vegetation at grade and on roofs, which provides cooling benefits while improving stormwater management.\n\n(4) The design takes an integrative approach to climate change resilience that accounts for the existing context and promotes the other design objectives of the area and the City.\n 19.40 CITYWIDE ADVISORY DEVELOPMENT CONSULTATION PROCEDURES\n 19.42 Small Project Review Procedure.\n 19.42.1 Applicability of Small Project Review Procedure.

These features may be freestanding or attached to a building.  \n Amend Sections 13.95.6, 13.104.1, 17.42.11, 20.97.3 to read as follows:\n 13.95.6 Surface Parking. All parking within the PUD-7 District shall be provided underground, as defined in Section 5.25.3.22 of this Zoning Ordinance, with the following exceptions that may be approved by the Planning Board in a Final Development Plan:\n\n(a) Surface Parking on Private Roadways. On-grade parking shall be allowed along private ways to be constructed within the PUD-7 District, provided that the location and amount of said on-grade parking shall be depicted in the Final Development Plan.\n\n(b) Interim Use of Surface Parking. On an interim basis, in anticipation of later construction of structured parking sufficient to meet all parking requirements, on grade open parking shall be allowed in a Development Parcel subject to the following conditions:\n\n(1) The future parking structure will be constructed within the Development Parcel or on an adjacent Development Parcel or outside of the PUD-7 District in a location that complies with the provisions of Section 13.95.1, but it may be located either on or off of the lot which it will serve;\n\n(2) Construction of the replacement parking structure will commence within five years of the date of certificate of occupancy for the building initially served by on grade parking;\n\n(3)The future parking structure will contain sufficient spaces for users of the building initially served by on grade open parking so as to meet the parking requirements for such building; and\n\n(4) Binding commitments exist to establish, to the reasonable satisfaction of the Planning Board, that requirements (1) through (3) above shall be satisfied. Such commitments shall be made by negotiated lease agreement, deed restriction, covenant, license, occupancy agreement or comparable legal instrument.\n\n(c) Where required, parking spaces for persons with disabilities may be located on-grade.\n\n(d)Nothing in this Section 13.95 shall prohibit the use of the surface parking spaces on Government Owned Lots.\n 13.104.1 Permitted Gross Floor Area (GFA). The following GFA shall be permitted within the PUD-8 District:\n\n(a) Existing GFA. The GFA that exists on a lot(s) to be covered by a PUD-8 Special Permit on the date of application for such PUD-8 Special Permit, which shall be calculated in accordance with the definition of Gross Floor Area under the Zoning Ordinance in effect at the time of adoption of this Section 13.100, except that the GFA of above-ground structured parking facilities in existence on or before September 15, 2000 shall be included in the calculation of Existing GFA (notwithstanding the exemptions under Section 5.25.3.3).\n 17.42.11 Special District 4. Other than as may be temporarily allowed in Section 17.46.1, the Gross Floor Area (GFA) permitted in Special District 4 shall be nine hundred thousand (900,000) square feet, exclusive of GFA occupied by structured parking not otherwise exempt as set forth in Section 5.25. An additional four hundred thousand (400,000) square feet of GFA shall be permitted for the exclusive use of structured parking not otherwise exempt from the calculations as to GFA, as set forth in Section 5.25. The permitted GFA shall be further limited by the requirements of Section 17.45 below. There shall be no maximum FAR limit imposed on any lot within the Special District 4. The provisions of Section 5.25.3.42 shall not apply in this Special District 4.\n 20.97.3 Waiver of Gross Floor Area Provisions for Parking Facilities - Section 5.25. Because of the unique factors related to flooding and groundwater management in Alewife, the importance of maintaining a high level of permeability, and the difficulty of constructing large areas of building below grade, the Planning Board may by special permit exempt the Gross Floor Area contained in any above ground structured parking facility from the FAR limitations established in this Section 20.90 and any applicable base zoning\n(such special permit shall supercede the provisions of Section 5.25.3.42 for any lot within the Alewife Overlay Districts). In granting such a special permit the Planning Board shall consider the following:\n 1. The facility advances the objective of the Concord-Alewife Plan.\n 2. A shared facility is established that aids in implementation of effective Transportation Demand Management measures to reduce dependence on the single occupancy automobile.\n 3. The facility is well designed, does not diminish the pedestrian-friendly quality the area around it, and is otherwise consistent with the urban design objective of the Concord-Alewife Plan.\n 4. The additional bulk of building above grade is well designed and does not have an unreasonably negative impact on its abutters or the public realm.\n 5. The extent to which the construction of an above grade parking structure facilitates the creation of at grade soil permeability.",

            "text": "WHEREAS: The City Council has been discussing the need to develop recommendations to balance the needs of our residents and lab community along our main corridors and squares, with the exception of Kendall Square and the Alewife Quadrangle;\ntherefore be it  \n  \n   ORDERED: That the City Manager instruct the Community Development Department to establish a working group comprised of CDD and the Inspectional Services Department staff, representatives from the various business associations\n(Kendall Square Business Association, Harvard Square Business Association,\nCentral Square Business Improvement District, East Cambridge Business Association, Cambridge Local First, and Cambridge Chamber of Commerce), lab developers and owners, diverse community representation totalling at least one-third of the overall working group, and representatives of the Affordable Housing Trust to develop recommendations on the following issues:\n 1. Consider where housing production of all kinds should be prioritized in these areas and develop strategies, including any changes to zoning and design guidelines necessary to ensure an appropriate balance of commercial and residential development. Include consideration of the economic competitiveness of both market and 100% affordable housing in relation to commercial development. \n 2\\. Addressing Nuisances (Noise, light, mechanicals, etc.) \u2013 Address the concerns surrounding commercial buildings and labs through design guidelines in zoning code, strengthening the building code where needed, and review other local and state regulations.\n 3\\. Reasonable restrictions on commercial building and lab size and use: Avoid any restrictive definitions of \u201clabs\u201d to prevent unintended consequences of hampering innovation and new trends in the very fluid lab, office, commercial,\nand technical workspace environment. Where appropriate, recommend some restrictions on the size and intensity of use and/or hazard level (i.e.,\nprohibit BSL 3 or 4) in certain neighborhoods to address concerns about health, safety and the impact of commercial and large lab buildings being built in or adjacent to smaller scale residential districts. Issue separate guidance for conversion of existing space versus ground-up new construction,\nespecially as it relates to any potential size restrictions.\n 4\\. 1035 Cambridge Street: Allow all current uses at 1035 Cambridge Street to continue by establishing a new zoning district encompassing 1035 and surrounding parcels. Due to the nature of current uses at 1035 and the rapidly changing landscape in Somerville around the new Union Square T station and Boynton Yards, 1035 Cambridge and the surrounding parcels should be looked at more closely. Explore whether the area should move forward as its own zoning overlay district with added height and density for housing along Cambridge Street and nearby.\n 5\\. Address the need for more housing through a pro-active discussion on mixed use and mixed income development of lab, housing, and retail. CDD should use the research and planning that has resulted from Envision Cambridge, Alewife Quad Study, and Our Cambridge Street Study along with future discussions of Central Square and North Massachusetts Avenue to identify concepts and best practices in urban planning to develop strong design guidelines and zoning and other possible recommendations that harness the economic dynamism of labs and the innovation economy to support the creation of co-located retail and housing via mixed-use developments (i.e., residential above lab above ground floor retail) of all scales.   ORDERED: That the City Manager report back to the City Council with working group appointments no later than May 1, 2023, and final recommendations no later than March 1, 2024.",

The observatory's director, Edward Charles Pickering, formed a group of skilled women called \u201cComputers\u201d who helped catalog and analyze thousands of early photographs of many different stars.\nMost of these women started primarily as calculators, and despite obstacles,\nmany made significant contributions to astronomy, and collectively as a group their accomplishments fundamentally changed the entire field of astronomy; and  \n  \n   WHEREAS: During this time, men were paid more than women, as a result although some of the Observatory female staff were astronomy graduates, their wages were similar to those of unskilled workers at the Harvard Observatory. These women astronomers earned between 25 to 50 cents an hour when measuring the brightness, position, and color of stars manually; and   WHEREAS: The group of women astronomers called the \u201cComputers\u201d were representative of the demographics of Cambridge in the 1920s. The 1920 census data show that 30%\nof Cambridge residents were immigrants, an additional 30% were children of immigrants and 10% had one immigrant parent. The city should recognize this group, and in particular the extraordinary astronomers both of whom were immigrants, Williamina P.S. Fleming and Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin; and   WHEREAS: Williamina P.S. Fleming was a single mother and worked as a maid for the director of Harvard\u2019s observatory, Edward Charles Pickerling. Pickering\u2019s wife taught Williamina how to analyze different stars which helped her become a\n\u201cComputer\u201d at Harvard's observatory; and   WHEREAS: Williamina became the leading female astronomer of her day as she cataloged more than 10,000 stars and discovered other astronomical phenomena; and   WHEREAS: Among several career achievements, Williamina established the first photographic standards of magnitude which became an important tool for astronomers. Her discovery helped astronomers measure the brightness of different stars; and   WHEREAS: Her achievements opened up the field of astronomy for many women. She was honored by a national gathering of astronomers for her contribution to the field where she was named a Curator of Astronomical Photographs at Harvard;\nand   WHEREAS: Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin left England in 1923 to pursue Astronomy in Massachusetts. She then lived several years at 52 Garden Street near the Harvard Observatory in the late 1920s; and   WHEREAS: Cecilia was Harvard's first female professor and first woman to become a chair of the Astronomy department. Her work on the nature of stars was foundational to modern astrophysics and she profoundly changed what we know about the universe today; and   WHEREAS: Cecilia contributed widely to the physical understanding of variable stars.\nShe was able to discover that the sun and other stars in the universe are composed almost entirely of hydrogen and helium; and   WHEREAS: Cecilia was one of the most brilliant and creative astronomers of the twentieth century. She was awarded the prestigious Henry Norris Russell Prize by the American Astronomical Society, which showed her lifetime of excellence in the field of astronomical research; and   WHEREAS: Both women meet the requirements for a dedication request and both lived and worked near Observatory Hill in Cambridge, overcame obstacles in life, and made significant contributions to the field of astronomy which were groundbreaking and are not celebrated sufficiently. By honoring these two stellar STEM pioneers together, the city could inspire residents; and   WHEREAS: Jolie Jourdan, an intern to the City Council worked on identifying appropriate people to honor from among many accomplished and noteworthy astronomers and selected Williamina P.S. Fleming and Cecilia Payne-Gaposchkin after consultation with the Harvard Observatory, the Historical Commission, and other historians, is requested to confer with the Dedication Committee to consider the request to dedicate a street corner jointly in honor of these remarkable women; now therefore be it   ORDERED: That the Executive Assistant to the City Council confer with the Dedication Committee to consider the request for a dedication in the vicinity of the Harvard Observatory on Concord Avenue or Garden Street to this pair of remarkable women as one dedication; and be it further   ORDERED: That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward this order to the Dedication Committee for review and approval.",

Any practice that by design or effect discriminates against individuals,\nbecause of race, color, sex, age, religious creed, disability, national origin or ancestry, sexual orientation, family and relationship structure, gender identity, marital status, family status, military status or source of income is of public concern, as such discrimination creates strife, hostility and unrest, threatens or impairs the rights and privileges of individuals and deprives individuals of the benefits of a free and open society.\nDiscrimination that deprives individuals of equal opportunities is unjust and results in serious injury to the public safety, health and welfare of the City.\n B. Accordingly, it is the policy of the City to safeguard the equal opportunities of all individuals in the City in accordance with their abilities, regardless of their race, color, sex, age, religious creed,\ndisability, national origin or ancestry, sexual orientation, family and relationship structure, gender identity, marital status, family status,\nmilitary status or source of income and to prevent discrimination against such individuals in the provision of City services and in employment, housing and real estate, education, credit, bonding, insurance and public accommodations.\n C.

The City, recognizing its commitment to nondiscrimination and fair treatment of its residents citizens and employees, adopts this chapter acknowledging domestic partnerships.\n B. The chapter allows persons in committed relationships who meet the criteria established by the City as constituting domestic partnerships to register at the office of the City Clerk and obtain a certificate attesting to their status. The chapter recognizes certain right of access for domestic partners.\nThis chapter, in conformance with the Human Rights Ordinance, which bars discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, age, religious creed,\ndisability, national origin or ancestry, sexual orientation, family and relationship structure, gender identity, marital status, and family status,\nmilitary status, and source of income, also equalizes the treatment of City employees.\n 2.119.100 Retaliation.\n No person shall discriminate or retaliate against a person who seeks the benefit of this chapter, registers or makes a declaration pursuant to its provisions, or assists another person in obtaining the benefits of this chapter to enter into a domestic partnership between two or more people.

When 820 Massachusetts Ave. was renovated with public support, the prevailing sentiment was that priority should be on maximizing the number of units in the property to get people off the street and into a safe home, which did not allow for kitchen facilities. Public policy has evolved\u201d; and   WHEREAS: The challenges facing Central House are immense and a more intentional conversation between various stakeholders is needed; now therefore be it   ORDERED: That the Human Services & Veterans Committee hold a public hearing to discuss options for addressing the situation at Central House and invite stakeholders including (but not limited to) relevant city departments, Central House staff,\nCaritas Communities executives, residents of Central House, Cambridge Housing Authority, and other organizations that place clients into units at Central House.",

This commitment could include relocation of healthy specimen trees and the retention of existing trees at the proposed Third Street/Broadway Park; and be it further   ORDERED: That a report on the status of such discussions and resulting strategy be given to the Council by the end of the term in December 2023 given the added urgency introduced by the growing environmental crisis.",

The Center would hold shooting ranges, a helicopter pad, and a \u201ctactical village\u201d meant to mimic an Atlanta neighborhood. It would enhance the militarization of not just the Atlanta Police Department, but any municipal, state or federal agency invited to train there. The military-inspired style of training will assuredly make Black,\ndisabled, poor, and other marginalized communities more vulnerable to the violence of over policing; and   WHEREAS: In May, 2009 the [Cambridge City Council](https://www2.cambridgema.gov/CityOfCambridge_Content/documents/Spec%20CC%20climate%20emergency.pdf)\ndeclared a climate emergency and we understand that the climate crisis is borderless. According to the [Georgia Forestry Commission](https://gatrees.org/learn-explore/environmental-benefits-of-\ntrees/), Atlanta forests remove about 19 million pounds of air pollutants each year and the Weelaunee (South River) Forest is one of the last [unspoiled forested areas](https://atlantaregional.org/news/press-releases/south-river-\nforest-community-engagement-process-aims-to-provide-vision-for-future-\nof-3500-acre-greenspace/) in the metro Atlanta area; and   WHEREAS: The area that the Center is planned to be placed on was stolen from the Muskogee Creek Nation by the Indian Removal Act of 1830, it had been used for Indigenous burial and ceremonial sites. [The land then housed a prison farm where many Black people were incarcerated and enslaved for accusations of violating Jim Crow laws. ](https://atlpresscollective.com/2021/08/14/history-\nof-the-atlanta-city-prison-farm/?amp=1)Building the Center would disturb this important land once again and [\u201ccontinue its long history of racism\u201d](https://www.ip3action.org/the-land-at-the-center-of-cop-city-and-why-\nwe-must-defend-it/); and   WHEREAS: Atlanta [Police murdered ](https://theintercept.com/2023/04/20/atlanta-cop-\ncity-protester-autopsy/)Manuel \u201cTortuguita\u201d Ter\u00e1n by shooting them [57 times](https://theintercept.com/2023/04/20/atlanta-cop-city-protester-\nautopsy/) during a multi-agency raid of the Weelaunee Forest (also known as the South River Forest). Autopsy reports show that Tortuguita had their hands raised when they were killed and there is no evidence that they were armed.\nEmbedded in a long tradition of environmental activism, Tortuguita among many others was camping in the Weelaunee forest in order to prevent deforestation and construction. They were murdered over 4 months before the Atlanta City Council had even approved public funds for the Center; and   WHEREAS: In a survey written by lender Cadence Bank, the Atlanta Police Foundation\u2019s Program Manager answered that [43% of recruited trainees](https://atlpresscollective.com/2023/01/24/over-40-of-anticipated-\ncop-city-trainees-would-come-from-from-out-of-state/) at the Atlanta Public Safety Training Center would be from out-of-state; and   WHEREAS: The Cambridge Police Department should not be trained by or alongside a policing system that violates constitutional and human rights; and   WHEREAS: Chicago, Baltimore, Tennessee, and Houston have already built or proposed\n\u201ctactical villages\u201d similar to the Center, indicating a growing and deeply concerning militarization of municipal police departments nation-wide; now therefore be it   RESOLVED: That the City Council go on record in opposition to the Cambridge Police Department and the City of Cambridge government sending trainees to,\nparticipating in any collaborations with, or supporting the Atlanta Public Safety Training Center; and be it further   RESOLVED: That the City Council go on record strongly condemning the destruction of the Weelaunee Forest and the building and implementation of the Atlanta Public Safety Training Center as a gross violation of human rights; and be it further   RESOLVED: That the City Council go on record in urging Representatives Katherine Clark and Ayanna Pressley and Senators Ed Markey and Elizabeth Warren to publicly condemn the destruction of the Weelaunee Forest and the building and implementation of the Atlanta Public Safety Training Center; and be it further   RESOLVED: That the City Clerk be and hereby is requested to forward a suitably engrossed copy of this resolution to the Atlanta City Council and Mayor Andre Dickens,\nand the offices of Senators Markey and Warren, and Representatives Clark and Pressley.",

Any practice that by design or effect discriminates against individuals,\nbecause of race, color, sex, age, religious creed, disability, national origin or ancestry, sexual orientation, relationship status, family structure, gender identity, marital status, family status, military status or source of income is of public concern, as such discrimination creates strife, hostility and unrest, threatens or impairs the rights and privileges of individuals and deprives individuals of the benefits of a free and open society.\nDiscrimination that deprives individuals of equal opportunities is unjust and results in serious injury to the public safety, health and welfare of the City.\n B. Accordingly, it is the policy of the City to safeguard the equal opportunities of all individuals in the City in accordance with their abilities, regardless of their race, color, sex, age, religious creed,\ndisability, national origin or ancestry, sexual orientation, relationship status, family structure, gender identity, marital status, family status,\nmilitary status or source of income and to prevent discrimination against such individuals in the provision of City services and in employment, housing and real estate, education, credit, bonding, insurance and public accommodations.\n C.

The City Council recognizes the diverse composition of its residents and values its people. The City Council acknowledges that the people's lives have evolved from when laws governing family relationships were enacted.\nPerpetuation of the traditional definitions of \"family\" excludes a significant segment of the Cambridge population, deprives them of recognition and validation, and denies certain rights that should be afforded to persons who share their homes, their hearts and their lives. The City, recognizing its commitment to nondiscrimination and fair treatment of its residents and employees, adopts this chapter acknowledging domestic partnerships.\n B. The chapter allows persons in committed relationships who meet the criteria established by the City as constituting domestic partnerships to register at the office of the City Clerk and obtain a certificate attesting to their status. The chapter recognizes certain right of access for domestic partners.\nThis chapter, in conformance with the Human Rights Ordinance, which bars discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, age, religious creed,\ndisability, national origin or ancestry, sexual orientation, family and relationship structure, gender identity, marital status, and family status,\nmilitary status, and source of income, also equalizes the treatment of City employees.\n 2.119.100 Retaliation.\n No person shall discriminate or retaliate against a person who seeks the benefit of this chapter, registers or makes a declaration pursuant to its provisions, or assists another person in obtaining the benefits of this chapter to enter into a domestic partnership between two or more people.
